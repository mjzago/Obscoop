The paper contributes to this task by focusing on the governance of agricultural cooperatives whose members often have heterogeneous preferences. The key novel idea is to conceptualize cooperative governance in the light of the proposed distinction between the core and peripheral activities of cooperatives. While core activities are based on members' truly common interests, peripheral activities include all else. This approach allows tracing governance challenges of agricultural co-operatives back to the inflation of peripheral activities. Based on this approach, cooperative managers and members are advised to minimize these activities and to draw clear boundaries between core and periphery.",,,Risk management; Cost management; Agricultural cooperatives

The empirical investigation is motivated by the dearth of empirical literature on agricultural cooperatives' performance measurement and its correlates. Design/methodology/approach The study employed DEA and applied the input minimisation constraint. The authors used the data from 19 agricultural cooperatives which had complied with reporting on their annual financial statements (AFS) in the financial year 2014/2015. The input variables were total assets and total expenses, and the output variables were revenue and profit. Findings The average technical efficiency was found to be 72 per cent efficient indicating the presence of 28 per cent resource wastages. Of the 19 decision-making units, only 5 (26 per cent) were 100 per cent efficient. It should be noted that the 26 per cent that were technically efficient were also operating at constant returns to scale (optimal resource allocation). Originality/value The study was necessitated by the continued focus on government based on the cooperatives, as there is a dearth of empirical literature separating managers' reports and empirically proven studies/results.",,,management of agricultural cooperatives; decision making; multicriteria evaluation; social choice procedures

They decide on big investment plans for the coming year as well as on many less important items like purchase price of pork and corn or service workshops and transport. The decision-making process nevertheless remains the same: they use statistical voting system to accept (or refuse) individual items. In standard situation of limited financial resources they have to create preference lists of individual items. This paper deals with mathematical properties of such preference lists and their comparison to statistical voting. If a board is to decide between two alternatives a and b, usually the majority rule procedure is applied and the alternative with the most votes is declared a winner. From mathematical point of view the majority rule properties were formulated by May (1952), who showed that if the number of board members is odd and each election procedure produces a unique winning item then the majority rule is the only so called social choice procedure for two alternatives that satisfies the following three conditions: it treats all the board members the same, it treats both alternatives the same and it is monotone. Nevertheless, if there are more than two possible choices, the situation is completely different. The inner structure of the problem is very rich and needs more detailed research. The situation is demonstrated on voting for investment items of the agricultural marketing cooperative Mrakov in South Bohemia.",,10.1016/j.ejor.2008.07.014,Marketing; Cooperative advertising; Game theory; Supply chain coordination; Pricing

Cooperative advertising plays a significant role in marketing programs of channel members. Nevertheless, most studies to date on cooperative advertising have assumed that the market demand is only influenced by advertising expenditures but not by retail price. This paper addresses channel coordination by seeking optimal cooperative advertising strategies and equilibrium pricing in a two-member distribution channel. We establish and compare two models: a non-cooperative, leader-follower game and a cooperative game. We develop propositions and insights from the comparison of these models. The cooperative model achieves better coordination by generating higher channel-wide profits than the non-cooperative model with these features: (a) the retailer price is lower to consumers; and (b) the advertising efforts are higher for all channel members. We identify the feasible solutions to a bargaining problem where the channel members can determine how to divide the extra profits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a robust crop production model applied to an agricultural cooperative. The objective of the model is to maximize the total revenue of the cooperative. The social aspect is addressed through a similarity in farmer revenues. Moreover, crop yield uncertainty, which results from the difference in skills of the farmers, is integrated in the robust model. The crop production plan must satisfy the market demand for each crop. Consequently, crop production that exceeds the demand is penalized. The models are solved by an optimization software, and the results indicate that when the model robustness increases, the value of the objective function decreases. However, the decision maker can make a decision tradeoff between the probability of constraint satisfaction and the value of the objective function.

However, there have been no efforts to investigate the role of collective entrepreneurship in the creation and management of new businesses in Morocco. Furthermore, we build on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate and explain entrepreneurial intention among the rural youth members of agricultural cooperatives, and identify the vulnerabilities and factors that influence the choice or decision-making between permanent membership at the cooperative and an entrepreneurial career. In this case, we apply the cognitive approach to survey rural youth in the Draa-Tafilalet region of Morocco in 2020. The binary logistic regression analysis technique has been used and applied to build the best model to explain why some rural youth members of the cooperative, but not others, choose to become entrepreneurs. We model how agricultural cooperatives may favor or inhibit the translation of entrepreneurial intention into new venture creation. A random sample size of 130 young people has been selected, from which 54 are intending to start a business and 76 have a negative intention of self-employment. The results of the analysis showed that socio-demographic variables, individual perceptions, previous experience, and the activities of the cooperative were statistically significant and reliable in building the binary logistic regression model. Findings also suggest that the risks of agribusiness and financing constraints have a negative influence on entrepreneurial intentions of the youth and women in agricultural cooperatives.",,,debt ratio; quick ratio; cooperative; ROA

For this purpose, the study uses the survey data of 1110 households in rural China and the endogenous treatment regression model for analysis. The control function approach addresses the selection bias of off-farm employment. The results show that smartphone use significantly increases women's decision-making power, partially channeled through increasing women's off-farm employment. The mechanism effect is robust to using both binary and intensive measurements of off-farm employment.

In this study, the relationship between the financial and social efficiency of South African agricultural cooperatives was examined. Data, comprising 1788 agricultural cooperatives, were obtained from the Cooperative Data Analysis System database. Only 387 observations without missing values were predicted in the empirical model. Data envelopment analysis scores for the financial and social efficiency indicators were computed. A two-stage residual inclusion method estimated the social efficiency model. The results show that social efficiency is positively influenced by financial efficiency and other factors. These include the number of employees, the enterprise type, and compliance with internal control practices. The social efficiency of agricultural cooperatives decreases for institutions that have recently been trained and that comply with the annual financial audits and profit tax. Social efficiency also decreases with age, but it increases with the square of the agricultural cooperative's age. This suggests that financially-efficient agricultural cooperatives may achieve social efficiency, that young agricultural cooperatives are not the ideal candidates for addressing the social efficiency challenges of agricultural cooperatives, and that the current training received by agricultural cooperatives does not empower them with social efficiency.",,,agricultural cooperative; restructuring; interdependencies

The lack of an appropriate methodological basis for creating agricultural cooperative system prevents the process of organizing formation of new agricultural cooperatives, which leads to an objective need to develop the organizational and economic basis for the formation and operation of agricultural cooperatives. In this regard, the research and study of theoretical aspects, analysis of objective conditions for the formation and operation of agricultural cooperatives, development of methodological provisions and practical recommendations to substantiate their organizational and economic mechanism, including matters of management, profit, price, credit, formation and distribution are topical to the issue and most of the components listed above are of great practical importance. Aim and tasks. The aim of the research is to develop scientific, organizational and economic basis for the establishment and operation of agricultural cooperatives in a multistructural economy. The objectives of the research are: identifying the essence of the cooperative, adding several principles to the formation and classification of agricultural cooperatives, determining the conditions and factors necessary for their creation. Results. Theoretical and regulatory aspects of formation and development of agricultural cooperatives were specified taking into account the introduction of new principles for their operation: mandatory creation of indivisible funds for innovative activities, agricultural producers' interest and expediency for their participation in the associations; and classification of cooperatives in the production and service industries. Conclusions. Based on consideration of the integrated approach to the formation of cooperatives and farmers' organizations, necessary documentation and calculation of economic efficiency, the methodological provisions developed in the process of the research on the establishment and operation of agricultural cooperatives will allow agricultural producers to approach the formation of necessary cooperatives skillfully, easily determine the absolute and specific tax burden of agricultural cooperatives.",,10.5304/jafscd.2018.081.011,Cooperative; Decision-making; Leadership; Emotions; Alternative Food Networks; Community Capitals

However, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in the cooperative legal form. This research has followed this rebirth in a region in the western United States where rural producers and urban consumers, gentrifying communities of color, and environmentally minded communities strive to improve other communities and food futures. As part of these efforts, it can be easy to assume cooperation within a legal status. Yet, as this research examines, cooperatives can be quite uncooperative in practice. Through extensive field work, we found that food and agriculture cooperatives struggle to make decision-making inclusive, may reproduce inequities through leadership performance, and may unevenly distribute the emotional work necessary to cooperation. These patterns also relate to how cooperatives access resources and point to tensions in expanding networks. While homogeneity can make interactions smoother-thereby making trust and day-to-day activities easier-it also limits a cooperative's (co-op) resource access. Resource access can be improved through partnerships, such as with nonprofits. However, these connections can lead to certain leadership performances that delegitimize cooperative efforts from the perspective of structurally disadvantaged community members. Further, the anonymity that consumers have become accustomed to creates challenges for recruiting shoppers because co-ops take more emotional work. A disproportionate amount of emotional work falls on staff members, contributing to resentment and insincere performance. We make a number of suggestions about how cooperatives can work to improve both organizational and interactional forms of cooperation.",,10.1080/23311975.2021.1968730,agricultural cooperative; member commitment; loyalty; identity; participation; Ethiopia

Consequently, it is important to identify what factors drive this decline to enhance member commitment and promote the performance of cooperatives. Thus, this paper seeks to explore the determinants of member commitment. Our empirical analysis is based on a 2014 survey among 240 members of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia. This paper makes two contributions to the academic body of knowledge on member commitment in agricultural cooperatives. First, it distinguishes between three elements of commitment: loyalty, identification and participation. By exploring the determinants of each element of commitment, we obtain a much richer picture of what drives members. Second, we make a distinction between multipurpose cooperatives and specialized marketing cooperatives. The study has important implications for policy makers, government and stakeholders of cooperatives for devising appropriate interventions that could enhance the commitment of members in agricultural cooperatives.",,10.1108/JOCM-12-2016-0262,Greece; Systems; Collective action; Risk; Governance; Ownership

Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the ideas of Habermas and Luhmann, this paper interprets preference heterogeneity of cooperative members in terms of the precarious relationship between the categories of system and lifeworld. The argument is buttressed with a case study of an agricultural cooperative recently founded in Central Greece. Findings - The sensitivity of cooperatives to the lifeworld contexts of their members exacts the price in the form of the member preference heterogeneity problem. If this sensitivity is taken to be the constitutive characteristic of cooperatives, then the proposed argument hammers home their fundamental ambivalence, as they are necessarily fraught with the potential for internal conflict. Research limitations/implications - The paper urges for a radical rethinking of Georg Draheim's thesis of the double nature of cooperatives. Double nature is shown to aggravate the member preference heterogeneity problem. Practical implications - The results of this study inform the cooperative leaders' quest to strike a balance between the interests of their members and the demands of the external socio-economic environment. Originality/value - This research contributes significantly to the literature on collective decision-making costs incurred by cooperatives. The failure of cooperatives to balance the sensitivity to members' interests and to the external environment is exposed as the root cause of the divergence and heterogeneity of member preferences. This heterogeneity is shown to boost collective decision-making costs.",,,Structural Equation Modeling; SWOT model

In the qualitative section, by holding several meetings with experts and through the method of brainstorming, the opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses for the adapting of the agricultural cooperative organization to learning organization were identified. Then, using the SWOT model, strategies and action plan were identified for adapting the cooperative organization to the learning organization.

When downstream activities become more important, cooperatives need to replace the member CEOs with professional CEOs.

Although these cooperatives have been promoted as ideal bottom-to-top organizations to integrate women into economy as entrepreneurs, there has been significant decline in their numbers. This paper tackles with this contradictory situation and intends to offer an alternative research framework on the viability of the women's agricultural cooperatives in Turkey.

While fruitful, this focus misses the motivations that prompt firms to take economic action in the first place. Understanding cultural embeddedness provides insight into why individuals and firms behave as they do and how their behavior can influence network structure. Contrary to the belief that firms act solely for profit and growth, we note that cultural contents such as values, social issues and political ideologies explain firms' motives and guide their economic activities. We explore the role of cultural embeddedness through a grounded study of Country Natural Beef, a sustainability-oriented agricultural cooperative in the western United States. This supply network demonstrates strongly competing cultural claims among its members as well as a unique institutionalized culture. Cultural interactions at the node and network levels explain the functioning of and changes to the network. Through interviews, analysis of archival information and direct observation of pivotal events over a period of 5 years, we unpack cultural embeddedness and take an incremental step toward a theory of cultural embeddedness in cooperative supply networks.

However, critical evaluation of how and to what extent the cooperative organization's participation leads the farmer's adoption of environmentally friendly technology (EFT) is relatively unclear. Thus, to critically explore the knowledge gap, the study evaluates the effects of cooperative participation towards adopting environmentally friendly production technologies based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The key variables used in the study have been extracted from an extensive literature investigation, while the empirical data has been collected from October to December 2020 from 292 kiwi-fruit farmers within the Shaanxi province of China. Simultaneously, the partial least square of structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) tools has been utilized to craft the final assessment. The factor loadings of all three latent variables have been statistically significant and interrelated for quantifying the proposed model. The statistically proven framework portrayed that cooperative organizations' participation positively impacts and shapes behavioral factors and facilitates the adoption of environmentally friendly production technologies. The study found the social structure like China, the impacts of cooperation could be crucial. As cooperative participation is an ample predictor for facilitating environmentally friendly technologies, the government should broaden the technical supports, and agricultural extension should also provide extended training for a smooth transition of the cooperatives.",,10.1093/erae/jbs008,product quality; cooperatives; wine market; D23; D22; Q13

Using primary data from a field survey of cattle farmers in China, this paper empirically examines the impact of policy cognition on livestock farmers' investment in manure recycling facilities. The impact is tested through the multiple mediator model to accommodate two potential mediating mechanisms, which are the agricultural cooperative membership and land leasing. Three conclusions arise. First, policy cognition has a significant posi-tive impact on both the diversification and amounts of farmers' investment in manure recycling facilities. Second, membership in agricultural cooperatives and participation in land leasing are two important mediating mecha-nisms for policy cognition to affect farmers' investment decisions on manure recycling. Finally, for the two medi-ating variables, leasing additional agricultural land promotes more investment in manure recycling facilities, but less in investment diversification, while cooperative membership has the opposite impact. This study contributes to three areas of literature on the factors affecting investment decisions, the mediating effects of policy cognition and the investment in non-production related assets. Regarding policy implications, we identify the importance of promoting policy awareness and agricultural cooperatives among livestock farmers, as well as developing land lease markets in agricultural regions in promoting investment in manure recycling facilities.

Yet, business sustainability literature on cooperative firms foregrounds the theoretical assertion that the existence of market power significantly influences financial sustainability.Purpose: The study set out to debunk the assertion that emerging cooperative firms in the Central Free State have market power that they can exert to increase their financial sustainability.Methodology: Drawing on the resource-based view theory and a review of literature, the study sought to establish whether market dynamics have a direct influence on the financial sustainability of emerging agricultural cooperative firms.Findings: The findings suggest that competition intensity and market concentration undermine the ability of the market power of cooperatives to positively predict long-term financial sustainability.

A total 150 cotton farmers were selected from three major cotton growing districts of the Punjab state. It was found that most of the respondents were falling in the age group of 43 to 56 years and were matriculates. Nearly half of the respondents possessed the medium size of operational land holding. Majority of the respondents found to be dependent on the non-institutional sources of credit. Study revealed that among ICT tools, weather applications were the most popular for getting information on weather conditions and used by 24.00 percent of the respondents. Nearly ten percent of the respondents used other ICT applications such as WhatsApp (7.33 percent) and Facebook (11.33 percent) for seeking agricultural information. It was also found that pesticide dealers and private companies' representatives were the major sources for seeking information by respondents. Majority of the respondents (82.00 percent) were members of agricultural co-operative societies in their villages. Farm literature, TV telecast and radio broadcasts were some other information sources utilized by the Bt cotton farmers in Punjab state. It was also found that area and productivity of Bt cotton at the fields of respondents started decreasing gradually due to decreased yields, price fluctuations, leading to lower gross income of the respondents.

Using evidence collected from case studies and print media publications, this paper contributes to the literature with a qualitative study of farmer cooperatives which spurred survival and longevity by means of strategic adaptation in response to four current developments in the external environment: industry consolidation, consumer segmentation, price volatility, and policy change. The qualitative study concludes farmer cooperatives in general respond to such developments by means of organizational growth. Common strategies are vertical integration, geographic expansion, and portfolio diversification. While survival and longevity are promoted in theory, strategic adaptation also often facilitates the pursuit of investor-oriented as opposed to user-oriented objectives. In some scenarios, member ownership and control may become burdensome to the business and prompt conversion to another structure if further adaptation to internal and external developments is unsuccessful.

In this case, the cooperative acts as a mechanism for rural development. The defining feature is that the mechanism of integrated development of rural territory to provide a comprehensive solution to the problems of the economy of the area and settlement, the formation and increase of investment attractiveness of the territory of the rural settlement and the creation of a working climate for private business are agricultural cooperatives. Analyzing the state of cooperation in the context of the European integration tendencies, which currently permeate the agrarian sector of the Ukrainian economy, studying the experience of cooperation among farmers of the European countries can be useful both from the point of view of its adaptation to domestic realities, and from the point of view of the most significant mistakes in development and miscalculations in rural areas. In addition, marketing studies have been conducted in rural areas of Ukraine, which have revealed the most significant areas of rural settlement development, including the creation and development of enterprises of meat, construction, tourism and recreational clusters and the development of joint ventures as growth points that activate the development of small and medium-sized businesses around them and the formation of interregional ties and rural cooperatives. Methods. Creating an agricultural consumer supply cooperative is the most effective mechanism for developing identified growth points and creating infrastructure to support them in rural Ukraine. The basis for the construction of an agricultural cooperative in rural areas is the formation of a model of maximum cost reduction for all members of the cooperative. Results. The further development and effective management of the cooperatives will contribute to solving socio-economic problems, improving the well-being of the peasants and, as a consequence, ensuring the integrated development of rural areas. Value/originality. Analyzing the activities of agricultural cooperatives operating in the world, we point out that research on the institutional foundations of the cooperative and its functioning as a mechanism of economic self-regulation give reason to claim that the cooperative does not have sufficient state support for its development. As a consequence, the number of cooperatives is steadily decreasing, we believe that the cooperative system of interaction of economic agents in the agricultural sector should include nationwide programmatic measures on institutional adaptation of cooperation as a mechanism of market self-regulation, a special form of integration, institutional mechanism for regulating entrepreneurship and the basis of cooperation, rules, traditions, organizations and institutions, the task of which is to determine the behavior of economic entities for the sake of satisfaction individual and social goals in the system of production and exchange of goods and services.",,,Performance evaluation.

We present a mathematical programming formulation of the model that represents the logistics management problem. As solving the exact model is computationally expensive, we opt for a hybrid heuristic approach that first uses an insertion heuristic algorithm to obtain an initial solution and then improvement processes are performed using the so-called simulated annealing metaheuristic.

Design/methodology/approach - An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used. Findings - The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers' IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. Practical implications - The findings indicate that agricultural cooperatives can be a transmission route in the efforts to proliferate the adoption and diffusion of IPM technology, and increased IPM adoption tends to improve the economic performance of farm households. Originality/value - Despite the widespread evidence of health and environmental benefits associated with IPM technology, the adoption rate of this technology remains significantly low.

These case cooperatives were chosen because they have innovative financial solutions. For example, members let their private assets and those of the cooperative constitute joint collateral when money is borrowed from financial institutions.

However, by improving access to markets and technologies, household membership in POs often results in commercialization of smallholder farming, leading to women disempowerment as men take over control of the farm. We use data from dairy smallholders in Kenya to explore the impact of membership in bargaining and processing POs on women empowerment. Applying the Women Empowerment Livestock Index, we capture six domains of empowerment: production; nutrition; resources; income; opportunities; and workload. We find that when a household joins any PO, regardless of whether the man or the woman in the household is the registered member, women achieve a higher control over production decisions, buying and selling of land and cows, use of loans and receiving dairy income. Distinguishing by gender of membership, there is stronger women empowerment when the woman in the household is a member. We also find that woman membership in bargaining POs results in greater empowerment, in terms of ownership of cows, than woman membership in processing POs. The paper suggests that women empowerment is affected by the functional characteristics of POs.",,,

Since rice is a major staple food in China, understanding factors affecting the performance of rice total factor productivity (TFP) is of great importance for China's future food security. Despite the growing importance of agricultural TFP, rigorous evidence-based studies on the impacts of cooperative membership on agricultural TFP, especially rice TFP, are scant, hindering the understanding about the potential contribution of agricultural cooperatives to TFP growth. This study examines the impacts of cooperative membership on rice productivity in China by using country-representative survey data from 2014 to 2018. An endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias. The empirical results show that cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact not only on rice TFP but also on TFP change, technical change and technical efficiency change. The results are robust to alternative choice of instrument variables. The effects of cooperatives on rice productivity are highly heterogeneous with regard to regions, farm scales and mechanization levels. Rice TFP gains through cooperatives are larger for producers in the eastern and central regions, while the effect on TFP growth is the highest in the western region. Regarding farm scales, cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact on rice TFP for small and medium farms but not for large farms. Moreover, cooperatives help improve rice productivity for provinces with low mechanization level of producers. This study further explores the underlying channels through which cooperative membership impacts rice productivity, and identifies that mechanical cultivation, high-quality inputs and technical training appear to be the main channels.

The farmer is required to purchase a certain amount of shares within specific limits to join in the co-op. The equity investment entitles the right to deliver a particular amount of qualified raw commodity in proportion, and the shares are transferable and appreciable. We consider a multi-period model in which the farmer first considers a one-time decision on participation (whether to join in the co-op). If yes, the farmer determines the production capacity and the initial equity investment in addition to the periodic production planning and equity investment adjustment when yield, spot prices, and share price are uncertain. We propose the condition under which the farmer shall participate in the co-op and characterize the optimal capacity and equity investment policies in closed form. We also investigate how the transferability of shares affects the farmer's optimal decisions and profitability by fixing the initial equity investment. Further, we examine the performance of a variety of heuristic policies when the quality requirement or the yield uncertainty is ignored.

In this framework, the model assumptions allow us to solve the local viability problem at the agent level.

Registered as a limited liability company, the center provides long-term product storage, product preparation for the market, and sales management. Despite a small share of ownership and management of this distribution company, fruit and vegetable producers benefit from increased sales security, extended sales periods, and secure collection. DCVP assures customers of higher product quality, which, combined with the extended selling period, leads to the increased selling price. Over the period 2009-2019, DCVP steadily increased its total assets by keeping its gearing ratio below 50%. DCVP reduces the number of days to collect receivables and the number of days to pay suppliers, i.e., farmers. A satisfactory liquidity level is achieved during the observed period, but the center's profitability is low. The average ROA during 2015-2019 is 0.07%. However, it should be emphasized that this institution's primary objective is not to maximize profits but to ensure a better position of small producers of fruits and vegetables in the market. The interviews conducted show a high level of satisfaction of the co-owners and the management with the center's achievements so far. Based on the results, we conclude that the DCVP is an excellent example for future public-private cooperation projects to increase domestic fruit and vegetable producers' competitiveness. The main recommendation for future projects is to involve producers in the decision-making process and develop accompanying activities to train farmers in new technologies and strengthen farmers' cooperation.",,,Cooperative; principles; success; management

The empirical basis consists of surveys of random samples of Swedish farmers conducted in 1993, 2003, and 2013. The results indicate a strong relationship between the social networks and the farmers' propensity to participate in cooperative governance. This relationship has persisted even though the investigated 20-year period was very turbulent for Swedish agriculture. Over time, members have become more willing to be elected when they receive backing from their social networks, with personal networks being more important than professional networks. The professional networks are related only to the level of aspiration and not actual participation in governance.

Encouraging farmers to self-organize was regarded as a useful tool to enhance the adoption of agricultural product certifications in Taiwan. However, previous studies solely focused on the association between membership in a production organization and single food certifications. Moreover, little is known of how different types of organizational participation could improve the adoption of agricultural product certifications. This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by employing multinomial logistic regression model (MNL) to investigate factors affecting farmers' decisions to participate in agricultural product certification. Special attention is paid to the role of different types of organizational participation in farmers' choices for agricultural product certification. The study used a nationally representative sample of core farmers in Taiwan, and its results revealed evident differences in farmers' organization types. For example, the farm operators who participate in agricultural cooperatives (co-ops) tend to use organic labels. In contrast, farm operators who participate in agricultural production and marketing groups (APMGs) tend to adopt the Traceable Agricultural Products (TAP) label. Moreover, age, education level, farming experience, farm labor, farm type, agricultural facilities, and regional location have a significant effect on farmers' choices for participating in agricultural product certification across different models. The findings suggest that policymakers should consider these differences in the organizational operation of APMGs and co-ops and provide customized measures by promoting different types of agricultural product certifications.",,10.1017/jwe.2017.1,cooperatives; French wine industry; survival analysis

However, they have not explored how members exercise their agency in challenging the class division. In summer 2013, at the height of China's cooperatization movement, I embarked on a project of engaged anthropology to mobilize shrimp farmers in South China to establish a cooperative so as to challenge agribusinesses that squeeze farmers' returns, but members ended up hiring outside labour.

Our analysis focuses on four Moroccan milk collection cooperatives that started using a milk analyzer with the aim of eliminating cheating by their suppliers. The cooperatives' room for maneuver in improving quality management was limited by the presence of competitors for milk collection and by the agro-industry's lack of transparency in the way its own quality controls were applied.

The objective was to implement certain rapeseed cultivation operations that had shown their efficiency in previous studies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: (i) the use of decision support systems (DSS) to calculate nitrogen fertilisation rates, (ii) the cultivation of legumes as intercrops with rapeseed or (iii) as previous crops. This paper first presents an estimate of the potential GHG effects of these cultivation operations, using results from previous studies obtained under experimental conditions or using crop modelling. It then presents the level of adoption by farmers of these cultivation operations in the context of the Demarche de progres DIESTER (R) initiative to continuously improve the environmental performance of rapeseed biodiesel. Depending on the year, 39 to 74 agricultural cooperatives and grain trading companies were involved in the study, and 90 170 to 283 480 hectares of rapeseed have been monitored. This is the first time in France that an attempt to improve cultivation operations for environmental reasons has been made on such a scale. The average GHG reduction values, compared to fossil fuels, varied from 49.5 to 55.8% depending on the year, which was most often above the 50% minimum reduction value for sustainable biodiesel, but well below the 70% minimum for very low GHG emission biodiesel. Using the results of previous studies, this article shows that the widespread use of decision support systems to calculate mineral N fertilizer rates, and the cultivation of legumes as a preceding crop or intercrop, would make it possible to significantly reduce GHGs and make it possible to produce very low GHG-emitting biodiesel in certain locations and/or years. However, the actual changes in cultural operations were too small to be effective.

In addition, agricultural cooperation stimulates the development of agrarian market infrastructure, plays an exceptional role in strengthening the economic potential, competitiveness and social status of agricultural producers, improving economic conditions and creating incentives for the growth of commodity products. However, so far its development is at a low level, the main reasons being the underestimation in the process of economic reforms of cooperative forms of economic activity, general unfavorable conditions for agricultural production, psychological unwillingness of peasants to cooperate and insufficient knowledge of the rural population about the benefits of cooperation, weak state support for small businesses in agribusiness and agricultural cooperatives.

This paper distinguishes production uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty in examining four kinds of business relationships of Chinese vegetable farmers: market exchange, cooperative membership without marketing transaction, cooperative membership with marketing transaction, and contract farming. We applied a multinomial logit model to data collected among 413 farmers in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. The results suggested that all three types of uncertainty significantly affect the business relationships chosen by vegetable farmers. In particular, it was found that as production uncertainty increases, farmers prefer contract farming and both cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction over market exchange; while as behavioral uncertainty increases, farmers are less likely to be involved in contract farming. Environmental uncertainty does not affect the likelihood that farmers choose market exchange or contract farming, while mixed results are obtained for its effects on cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction.

Building on Galbraith's insight that corporations cause subtle but pervasive societal imbalances, the paper locates the role of nonprofit organizations in compensating for these imbalances, thus showing corporations and nonprofit organizations to be mutually complementary rather than antagonistic actors. This argument is supported by Niklas Luhmann's vision of the precarious relationship between the complexity and sustainability of social systems as well as by Kenneth Boulding's analysis of the farmer and labor movement. Luhmann's and Boulding's perspectives show profit-seeking corporations to be social systems developing high technological complexity at the cost of sacrificing their societal sustainability, while the improvement of the latter constitutes the rationale of many nonprofit organizations. The same systems-theoretic logic suggests, however, that nonprofit organizations may tend to underestimate the technological complexity of implementing their mission-related activities, thereby undermining their own effectiveness.

Consequently, as ownership is dispersed and control is delegated, members may face increasing agency cost. In spite of the potential to impact performance and even survival, empirical attention to agency problems in farm producer organizations is limited. The purpose of this paper is to address the gap in the literature with an empirical study. Design/methodology/approach With survey responses from 365 farm producer organizations in the USA, the author uses a two-limit tobit model to estimate the relationships of six ownership and governance characteristics (i.e. board size, management size, director independence, manager independence, CEO independence and non-member ownership) to agency cost, which is proxied by the operating expense ratio. Findings While controlling for heterogeneity in scale and technology, the author finds positive relationships of board size, management size and CEO independence to agency cost. The novel result illustrates there is a significant cost to the adoption of non-traditional ownership and governance characteristics by farm producer organizations.

A variety of diverse studies on the Almeria agricultural and credit cooperative sector and the exploration of social-economic and eco-social indicators, in addition to economic-market indicators are presented. Each correspond to a cooperative logic that spans theoretical perspectives from the dominant economic-market model, new institutionalism, and an eco-social approach, echoing theories on collective coordination governance, and the avoidance of the tragedy of the commons. The latter is of particular importance given environmental challenges and scarce resources for agricultural activity. The cooperatives in Almeria have increasingly relied on collective collaboration and coordination in order to meet social-economic and social-ecological challenges, transforming their role from that founded on a market dominant logic to that of cooperation as a coordination mechanism based on the mutual benefit of the community and environment. In turn, their ability to meet a wide range of needs and challenges of members and the community leads to their longevity.

Bringing this paradigm to bear on the cooperative scholarship, the paper views cooperatives as operationally closed systems maintaining a precarious relationship to their outer environment, which includes cooperative members. In view of their operational closure, cooperatives tend to overstrain the carrying capacity of their environment by being active in the areas marked by a limited extent of the true commonness of member interests. This overstraining results in a host of problems associated with member heterogeneity. The fundamental solutions following from the system-environment paradigm require the adjustment of cooperative boundaries and goals in light of the evolving range of the true common interests of members.

This study adopted cross sectional survey data from 27 pig cooperatives and their 540 farmers in China to test the influence of cooperatives' services on farmers' safe production behaviour. The hypotheses were tested using a logit regression model. The findings indicated that although the number of services is not a key determinant of farmers' safe production behaviour, service quality matters. When a cooperative is strongly capable of involving more farmers in certain services, and provides certain services in more frequency, member farmers behave more safely. The results also show that veterinarian and pig-selling services play an important role in ensuring farmers' safe production behaviour. For this study, the quality of cooperatives' services is implied to have a positive impact on farmers' safe production behaviour. Leaders/managers of cooperatives must try to improve the quality of their services instead of merely attempting to provide a large number of services.

Different combinations of belief systems, limits, diagnostic control, and interactive control were observed depending on whether the cooperative adopted defender or prospector strategic behaviors. Control of the cooperative's strategy is achieved by combining the MCSs, since their strength lies in their joint use and their complementarity.

We compare the quality of wine producers with and without GIs and test for the effectiveness of GIs based on (a) the strictness of GIs' production standards and (b) GIs' organizational characteristics as a collective brand. We argue that GIs encourage producer quality because they attenuate free-riding problems, provide incentives to invest and facilitate knowledge sharing. Focusing on the Spanish wine industry, the results reveal that except for wineries with the lowest GI category (i.e., protected geographical indication), GI wineries show higher quality than non-GI wineries. We also observe that more stringent categories increase quality but at a decreasing rate. Regarding the influence of organizational features, we found that collective action problems seem to be relevant. First, above a certain threshold, the number of producers affiliated with a GI decreases the wine producer's average quality (i.e., it shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with quality). Second, GIs covering very large geographic areas are found to be less effective.

Semi-structured interviews with a cross section of key stakeholders and thematic content analysis are used to identify key factors. Leadership, information sharing, trust, market forecasting, risk sharing, accountability, and provision of agronomic and other support to growers are identified as key factors that distinguish this cooper-ative hybrid model from more standard business models. Achieving both horizontal and vertical integration maximises resource utilisation and returns to growers, as well as reducing market uncertainty and maximizing product consistency. However, there are also higher costs involved with hybrid models, particularly the focus on communication and engagement required to maintain the trust of growers. These costs increase with the size and complexity of the cooperative, which creates a tension because size and scale are often required to generate the efficiencies and market power necessary to deliver benefits.",,,Newcastle disease; Rift Valley fever; livestock vaccines; Rwanda; female smallholder farmer; gendered decision making

Yet, its success rate is particularly dependent on the managerial capacities of urban gardeners to coordinate and organize collective actions for the successful exploitation of the gardens. The calls from governments to organize cooperative structures among farmers seem justified and merits a high priority on agricultural policy agendas. Although principles of cooperative structures exist, there is no blueprint available that indicates how to start a gardeners' cooperation. Moreover, these collaborations need to ally with and build on existing social structures of the urban gardeners involved. Our research can contribute to this alignment process by exploring and comparing international standards of prevailing organizations and their functioning among 261 gardeners in two cities in Benin. We found that a vast majority of urban gardeners are members of a cooperation. Nevertheless, their membership is largely titular because gardeners mostly behave semi-autonomously and few decisions are taken collectively. The obvious economic advantages of leveraging bargaining power, reducing transaction costs, and increasing possibilities for loans are seriously underutilized. We suggest that capacity building can help to develop cooperation among urban gardeners to reach their full potential which, congruently, should also improve the livelihoods of the urban poor.",,,productivity; cooperatives; partial adjustment model; panel data

In comparing organic and conventional vegetables chains, we have identified five types of POs and we have investigated their distinct organizational characteristics. We found, first, that POs in the organic value chain are responding to market incentives, whereas POs in the conventional value chain are responding to public incentives. Second, contrary to POs with a focus on social and political activities, POs with economic activities are small, they have a product focus, they require member investment, and they have a high formalization status. Third, POs with output-driven objectives have higher levels of horizontal and vertical coordination than POs with value-driven objectives.

In this article, we propose a method that can operate on nominal and numeric attributes to obtain fuzzy classification rules by combining a competitive neural network with an optimization technique based on variable population particle swarms. The fitness function that controls swarm movement uses a voting criterion that weights, in a fuzzy manner, numeric attribute participation. The efficiency and efficacy of this method are strongly conditioned by how membership functions to each of the fuzzy sets are established. In previous works, this was done by partitioning the range of each numeric attribute at equal-length intervals, centering a triangular function with appropriate overlap in each of them. In this case, an improvement to the fuzzy set generation process is proposed using the Fuzzy C-Means methods. The results obtained were compared to those yielded by the previous version using 11 databases from the UCI repository and three databases from the Ecuadorian financial system one from a credit and savings cooperative and two from banks that grant productive and non-productive credits as well as microcredits.

Scale development to measure cooperative attributes resulted in six latent variables: A need to restructure the farm business, the membership role in the cooperative, opportunity, fear of negative evaluation, self-efficacy, and cooperative (dis)loyalty. The latent variables identified were tested against behavioral intentions in two logistic regressions where the dairy farmers' plans for remaining or exiting the cooperative and their plans for postfarm gate entrepreneurial activities were the dependent variables. Two latent variables emerged as significant predictors: restructuring the farm business and the membership role. These predictors were push factors in the model, suggesting that dissatisfaction with delivery to existing dairy cooperatives, rather than job or life satisfaction from setting up their own business, acted as farmers' motive to exit.

The main reasons discussed in the literature are information asymmetries, which leads to adverse selection and moral hazard, as well as the absence of profit orientation due to poorly specified and diluted property rights. However, although, in reality, many cooperatives indeed perform poorly, and some are apparently able to completely avoid or at least reduce the problems that are considered prototypical for this hybrid organizational form. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics required to reduce the problems resulting from poorly specified property rights and information asymmetries and, hence, to successfully compete in the market. The data we use to identify the characteristics that separate good and bad cooperatives encompass 136 organizations in Austria, Germany, and northern Italy. Our logistic regression estimations show that older and larger cooperatives (in terms of acreage) have a significantly higher probability to be listed in at least one of two highly respected wine guides. Moreover, German cooperatives have a significantly lower probability of being listed than either Austrian or northern Italian cooperatives. The findings suggest that differences in performance can be explained by the management of cooperatives.",,,risk management; prevention plan; risks

To enhance the sheep productivity, 16 Bonga sheep breed improvement cooperatives were established in Kaffa zone of southern Ethiopia. Even though the cooperatives bring success in terms of breed improvement and income generation, there's no empirical evidence of this. Thus, this study was intended to identify factors affecting cooperative membership and estimate its impact on farmers' income. To do this, data from 320 sampled households were collected by using multistage sampling techniques. For analysis, the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model was employed. The result of ESR estimation shows that the probability of farmers' membership decision is decided by the number of sheep owned, extension contact, and proximity to a cooperative office. The model results further confirm that members get significantly better (34%) than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better (56%) than members if they had joined cooperatives. This suggests sheep breeding cooperatives are effective in improving the income of sheep producers. Thus, efforts need to be made to tackle factors that are impeding households' cooperative participation. Further, strengthening of the existing cooperatives and establishment of additional cooperatives is suggested.",,10.1111/apce.12371,cooperatives; endogeneity; goat production; instrumental variable; stochastic frontier analysis

Multistage sampling and in-person interviews were used to collect information from 334 nonmember and 327 member cooperative farmers from two prominent goat production districts in Nepal. We use translog production function to calculate the technical efficiency. The endogeneity associated with cooperative membership is addressed through an instrumental variable approach. The one-step analysis was used to avoid bias due to the one-sided stochastic frontier analysis error. All conventional inputs have significant and positive impact on performance. Cooperative membership shows positive and significant impact on technical efficiency. The average technical efficiency score of cooperative members was 93.2%, while of nonmembers was 90.7%, and the difference was significant.

The logit model and the artificial neural network model have been developed to reflect risk factors to identify the probability of default by each new borrower. The study supports the use of the logit model to develop the system because it gives more accuracy in predicting the probability of default and debtor classification than the artificial neural network model. The working process of the system is classified into two sections including credit risk management, which is the process of screening the loan applications and setting the credit approval or rejection criteria, and affordability risk management, which is the process of determining the maximum loan amount for the debtor who has passed the credit approval criteria. In this study, the author caps the debt service ratio as a threshold for determining the amount of credit (the loan amount approved and interest expense) at 70% and determines that the maximum loan principal is 63% of the debtor's total annual income.

Design/methodology/approach - Analysis based on secondary data sources and interviews with people involved when the dominant meat co-operative in Sweden underwent major changes. Findings - The decline in the Swedish meat industry is interpreted using the theory of institutional change presented by Aoki (2007, 2011). The country's former national agricultural policy created a specific set of norms and values. Co-operatives were considered to be indispensable. The co-operative sector was large and hierarchically organised. Therefore, external signals did not create sufficient endogenous processes within the co-operatives. Co-operative adaptation to rising competitive pressure took place only reluctantly and belatedly. Hence many farmer-members defected and the major co-operative faced finally insurmountable problems. A strong ideological conviction caused the once dominant co-operative to collapse and much of the Swedish meat industry to disappear. Originality/value - This study shows that strong ideology (here a conviction about the advantages of politically governed co-operatives) can hamper endogenous processes within an organisation. Management may ignore outside influences, to the extent that even a large industry is impaired. Other large, hierarchically structured and top-governed organisations with a strong ideology may behave in a similar way.",,10.1108/JSM-07-2018-0195,Word-of-mouth; Co-operative enterprise; Member loyalty; Mutual enterprise

It requires substantial capital to facilitate such a transition, but it is very difficult for farmers in China to access bank credit. One way that commercial farms have to overcome such handicap is by organizing themselves into cooperatives. To assess the effect of cooperatives on the credit accessibility of commercial farms, we have developed a theoretical model as well as an empirical study of commercial farms in Jiangsu Province based on data from a survey of 754 commercial farm owners. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method that control endogeneity problem are used in the analysis. The empirical results show that cooperatives have a significant positive impact on the credit access of commercial farms. Commercial farms participating in cooperatives may alleviated their credit constraints by about 17.3 percentage points and increase the average credit per capita by nearly 80,000 Yuan. Cooperatives improve the credit access of commercial farms by exerting strong market power and reputation effect based on its organizational advantages.

We visualize the interventions and outcomes in an Evidence Gap Map, highlighting both the available evidence and remaining knowledge gaps. Most studies suggest that strengthening local institutions can improve the delivery and targeting of public services and overall satisfaction with local governance. There are however, clear limitations and knowledge gaps highlighting priorities for future work. Few studies assess impacts on final outcomes such as household income or agricultural productivity and no studies assess inclusive and green outcomes jointly. We discuss the key benefits of a structured literature search and Evidence Gap Map for policy-makers and development practitioners and illustrate how it serves as a knowledge repository and identifies where evidence is lacking, thus setting the agenda for future work.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0120563,

Farmers have been exposed to multiple stressors including climate change, and they have managed to adapt to those risks. The adaptation actions undertaken by farmers and their decision making are, however, only poorly understood. By studying adaptation practices undertaken by apple farmers in three regions: Nagano and Kazuno in Japan and Elgin in South Africa, we categorize the adaptation actions into two types: farmer initiated bottom-up adaptation and institution led top-down adaptation. We found that the driver which differentiates the type of adaptation likely adopted was strongly related to the farmers' characteristics, particularly their dependence on the institutions, e.g. the farmers' cooperative, in selling their products. The farmers who rely on the farmers' cooperative for their sales are likely to adopt the institution-led adaptation, whereas the farmers who have established their own sales channels tend to start innovative actions by bottom-up. We further argue that even though the two types have contrasting features, the combinations of the both types of adaptations could lead to more successful adaptation particularly in agriculture. This study also emphasizes that more farm-level studies for various crops and regions are warranted to provide substantial feedbacks to adaptation policy.",,10.15302/J-FASE-2021416,agroecology; codesign; intercropping; knowledge sharing; participatory methods

The objective was to share firsthand experience of participatory research among researchers who were mostly not familiar with this approach. Workshop participants were divided into smaller multidisciplinary groups and given the opportunity to interact with representatives from eight actor positions in the value chain of the agrifood cooperative Terrena located in Western France. The four stages of the workshop were: (1) key actor interviews, (2) sharing proposed solutions for overcoming barriers, and (3) developing possible interdisciplinary concepts. Expressions of frustration were recorded serving both as a motivation for group members to become more aware of the scientific concerns and practices of their colleagues, as well as a recognition that some researchers have better skills integrating qualitative approaches than others. Nevertheless, the workshop format was an effective way to gain a common understanding of the pertinent issues that need to be addressed to meet overall multiactor-approach objectives.

The understanding of land management and agriculture is very different between the groups. The paper presents the data of a project which is the collaboration of a Swiss and a Romanian team in a three-year programme (SCOPES programme of Swiss National Science Foundation), in which a survey was carried out with the help of questionnaires. This was applied in a sample of 612 rural households in four municipalities. The main questions focused on land use and land inheritance as well as agriculture. The sample included two generations: the parents and their children (362), men and women. The research team looked for an answer to the question: who are the next generation farmers in Romania and are there cultural and ethnic and also gender-based differences between rural families? As the data show there are four different strategies applied in the four regions. In one, traditional sustainable agriculture was preserved, combined with a high rate of international migration. In another village there is a good perspective for farming, but a lot of young people are going to other sectors of activities.

In the present work, the effect of thermal processing on phytochemical profiles, antioxidant capacity, and volatile compounds of fig wines was investigated. The results show that varieties of detected volatiles and the content of anthocyanins in fig wines decreased significantly owing to fig drying, while individual phenolic concentration increased. The drying process exhibited no significant effect on the contents of total polyphenols and flavonoids, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and oxygen radical-scavenging capacities, whereas prefermentation heating showed a negative effect on the antioxidant capacity and phenolic compositions, and resulted in a significant decrease of the contents of acetaldehyde and acetoin. Overall, fig drying showed a stronger effect on the flavor profile of fig wines compared with prefermentation heating. Choosing an appropriate thermal processing procedure is essential to preserve the antioxidant capacity and flavor of fig wines. Practical applications Figs are sodium-, fat-, and cholesterol- free, while they are rich in fibers and antioxidants compounds.

The agricultural sector is so extensive that achievement of national goals and high levels of development is practically unattainable without active participation by farmers. Provision of a combination of agricultural functional requirements by cooperatives would lead to enhancement of the standard of living of their members. Rural production cooperatives, also known as agricultural cooperatives, are defined as a modern construct with their own specific organization and management. Cooperatives incorporate their own ruling principles, structures, networks, rules, regulations, and bylaws. These features provide concrete benefits in the process of agricultural development.

This qualitative research was conducted in Iran using case study and purposeful sampling method.

Here we show that acting through machines changes the way people solve these social dilemmas and we present experimental evidence showing that participants program their autonomous vehicles to act more cooperatively than if they were driving themselves. We show that this happens because programming causes selfish shortterm rewards to become less salient, leading to considerations of broader societal goals.

In Nicaragua, palm oil cultivation dates back to the 1950s, when the United Fruit Company started to plant oil palm on the Atlantic Coast. In the 1980s, due to the agrarian reform of the Sandinista revolution, political conditions and economic strategies changed completely. In this era, a socialist government started to create agricultural cooperatives for oil palm. After the defeat of the revolution, during the neoliberal era of the 1990s, palm oil cultivation expanded in different surges. This expansion was tied to funding from international organizations, especially during the conjuncture of the bioenergy framework, which implied a new narrative of sustainability from the global level. The extent of the territory on which oil palm is cultivated more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2010, and again more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, although the Sandinista government was back in power and not particularly supportive of oil palm. The article argues that although the drivers, the main actors, their specific arguments, funding sources, and policies promoting oil palm have varied over time, the narrative of 'already degraded land' has consistently been used. Social contestations from below point not only to environmental and social consequences, but to the funding schemes and narratives of international institutions sponsoring and promoting oil palm.",,,agricultural cooperative; commercial activity; product diversification; Spain
,food safety controls in different governance structures in china's vegetable and fruit industry,"Zhou, JH; Li, K; Liang, Q",JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE,2095-3119,14,11,2189-2202,2015,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61115-7,"This document describes two case studies of cooperative experiences in Spain. The two cases are significantly different in terms of production, volume and scale, however they have evolved in a similar way. Specifically, each of the cooperatives began when a small group of producers organized to collectively obtain inputs. Since then, through a series of stages, they have reached the point of collective transformation and commercialization of a great diversity of products. The first case is the Sobrarbe Agricultural Limited Cooperative (Sociedad Cooperativa Limitada Agropecuaria del Sobrarbe-SCLAS), created in 1983, with its headquarters in Ainsa, the Sobrarbe county seat, in the province of Huesca in the Autonomous Community of Aragon. Sobrarbe County, with a population density below three inhabitants per square kilometer, is one of the areas in Spain that has most intensely suffered a depopulation process since the middle of the 20(th), century. SCLAS has a strong connection with the territory where it operates and is focused on maintaining and promoting agricultural life in Sobrarbe County and the Pyrenean mountains in general. Since its origins as a bakery established to supply bread to the most remote mountainous areas, the cooperative has been expanding to include a range of different facets and activities, such as: (i) supplying fertilizers and seeds; (ii) purchasing and storing harvested crops (cereals, oleaginous seeds, hay); (iii) a cooperative store for food, veterinarian pharmacy, plant health, livestock material, hardware and miscellaneous (work clothing, shoes, etc.); (iv) compound and mineral feed manufacturing; (v) veterinarian service, feed advice, and fiscal and financial advice; (vi) completing paperwork for the CAP and agro-environmental assistance; (vii) plans for new facilities; (viii) technical reports; and (ix) commercial technical management. The endless list of the cooperative's activities provides livestock producers and farmers with a framework for meeting their needs. This would otherwise be difficult, given the disadvantages in a challenging rural setting (poor roads and highways, depopulation, lack of services, etc.). The range of activities carried out by the cooperative was recognized with an Award for Diversification granted at the 1995 Conference of the Spanish Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives (Federacion Espanola de Cooperativas Agrarias). One example of the cooperative's diversification can be seen in its veterinarian services, which provide clinical attention to various animal species, as well as animal feed services, plans for livestock facilities, R&D activities with research institutions, quality controls, a veterinarian pharmacy, management of genealogical books, and the promotion of new production efforts. SCLAS also fulfills an important role by assisting producer groups that have been organized in the county to address natural resource management and the sustainability of agro-livestock activities. Some examples are the Sierra y Canones de Guara Livestock Farmers Association (Asociacion de Ganaderos de la Sierra y Canones de Guara), the Association of Pyrenees Inhabitants (Asociacion de Habitantes del Pirineo), and the Huesca Extensive Meat Producers Community (Comunidad de Productores de Carne Extensiva de Huesca). The second case study is on the Pedroches Valley Agro-Livestock Cooperative (Cooperativa Agroganadera del Valle de los Pedroches-COVAP), located in the southwestern part of the Iberian peninsula. It operates in a territory consisting of 15,000 square kilometers, with a population of 250,000 inhabitants who work primarily in the areas of agricultural and livestock farming. Significant economic activity has been developed during recent years around the agro-food industry and related services. The average altitude in the area is 650 meters above sea level, with low rainfall at 350mm/m(2), and an extreme continental climate. The land is not particularly apt for cereal cultivation or pastureland. The entire territory is dominated by the oak-meadow ecosystem, which is characteristic of the southwest part of the peninsula, with the holm oak (Quercus ilex) as the dominant arboreal species. In this territory COVAP has developed a unique agro-food model that integrates the entire production chain, including animal feed, genetics, breeding centers, a slaughterhouse, a milk industry and the commercialization of all products. The number of dairy cattle has increased to 30,000, distributed in 450 operations; the number of beef cattle integrated into the enterprise is 20,000 and the number of sheep, 180,000. Ninety percent of milk production is distributed in the domestic market, and ten percent in the European Union and other countries. Seventy percent of meat production is distributed in the domestic market and thirty percent in the European Union. Previously, dairy farming was practically non-existent in the area, however at the end of the 1970s, dairy cattle breeding was initiated, and numerous operations were established, with 2-3 cattle per farmer. With COVAP's support to farmers and efforts in commercialization, this area has become one of the most important centers of dairy production in Spain, with an annual production of 220,000 metric tons.",,10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61115-7,food safety control; governance structure; farmer cooperative; agricultural company; family farm

Food safety control is expressed by the following aspects, i.e., pollution-free, green, organic, and/or geographical indication products certification, establishment of production records, and pesticide residue testing. Three types of governance structures that engage in agricultural production are distinguished: farmer cooperatives, agricultural companies, and family farms. The food safety control practices of various governance structures are investigated based on a database that comprises 600 vegetable and fruit enterprises in Zhejiang, China. The results show that (1) pesticide residue testing is adopted by the most firms, followed by products certification, and production records are adopted by the fewest firms, and (2) agricultural companies adopt more food safety control practices than family farms, while farmer cooperatives adopt the fewest food safety control practices. Governance structure features of a cooperative in terms of ownership, decision-making, and income distribution are the main reasons for the low level of food safety control in the cooperative.",,10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02120.x,celery; nitrogen fertilization and quality; shelf life

Given recent trends in urban migration and increased opportunities for off-farm work, aging farmers increasingly face problems with farmland succession and usage in China. This study investigates the usage of farmland in the absence of a farm successor. Using multinomial logit regression model and data from rural households, we find that aging farmers without successors tend to have options for farmland usage. Specifically, the presence of a grain subsidy increases the likelihood of keeping the farmland in agriculture-albeit by hiring labor or leasing out farmland and decreases the likelihood of pooling farmland into farming cooperatives as shareholders. Off-farm work decreases the likelihood of using hired labor and leasing out farmland. Rich rural households are less likely to keep farmland idle. Large farm operators are more likely to lease out farmland. Finally, rural people with pension plans are more likely to pool their land in land cooperatives - a less-risky option.",,10.3390/su13105543,sustainable management practices; digitalisation; cooperatives; wine; Germany

Cooperatives in the wine sector of some EU countries even surpass a market share of more than 50%. In Germany, the first wine cooperative was established in 1868 in the Ahr region. Despite the decline in the number of cooperatives, of members and of the vineyard area cultivated by cooperatives, wine cooperatives are still accountable for roughly a quarter of the German vineyard area. Due to developments in the field of sustainability and digitalisation, cooperatives are facing increasing pressure. Based on the definition of cooperatives by the International Co-operative Alliance, one can conclude that cooperatives are a sustainable form of enterprise. A previous study from 2019 showed that sustainability and digitalisation were not mentioned by cooperative management as important topics in the competitive analysis. Also, sustainable management practices have not been analysed explicitly for wine cooperatives so far. We therefore consider sustainability and digitalisation in the context of the strategic management of wine cooperatives. Our article does not aim to show further development in the areas of sustainability and digitalisation but rather to unveil existing managerial practices in order to provide a basis for management decisions. As only limited knowledge exists, a qualitative approach was chosen. Interviews were conducted with the management of wine cooperatives (n = 13) and representatives of the regional and national cooperative associations, which in turn represent the wine cooperatives as a whole (n = 4). A data content analysis was performed. The results describe state of the art of sustainable management practices and digitalisation in wine cooperatives. Even if the understanding of sustainability and digitalisation is quite similar among the respondents, the operationalisation in the cooperatives differs strongly. However, it is clear that innovation, adaptability and sustainability are strongly interlinked.

The current research indicates the different activities developed by this cooperative as part of a sustainable model aimed to permeate in rural communities all over the northeastern Sierra of Puebla. Today the cooperative is integrated by 290 communities from 22 municipalities in the northeastern Sierra of Puebla, whose members are mainly from Nahuatl and Totonaca origin aiming at a sustainable development for their families, communities and the region. The model promoted by the Cooperative is based on the premises of democracy, fair economic participation, self-reliance, autonomy, compromise, gender equality and cooperation, aiming to provide a healthy diet, profitable businesses while employing the community members, stressing the importance of improving their skills on the individual and the collective level. Revaluation, rescue and preservation of their culture are some of the ultimate goals, working within a sustainable framework. This research emphasizes some activities implemented by the cooperative as good examples of sustainable strategies to achieve development in rural areas. A few instances are: The creation of an eco-friendly hotel featuring 15 rooms and 14 cabins where different eco techniques are applied, such as the usage of bamboo for building and a rainwater collector system, among others.

However, the income growth rate of farmers is relatively low, and the income gap between urban and rural areas is widening. Using a sample of 1,325 large-scale farming households in Lin'an, this study constructs a theoretical path for how the level of vertical integration and an organization model affect farmers' income levels and empirically tests the path using a mediation effect analysis model. The results indicate that organization models and vertical integration are important factors that affect farmers' income levels. The total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who participate in agricultural operation organizations are greater than that of farmers who do not participate in an operation organization. In addition, the total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who produce and process and those who produce, process, and sell are higher than those of farmers who only produce. A farmers' organization model has both a direct and an indirect positive influence on their income level, with the indirect positive influence coming through the mediating variable of vertical integration. The application of the organizational model can promote the growth of rural households' total family income and agricultural income by 13.48% and 14.48% respectively, consisting of direct increases of 9.67% and 10.19%, and indirect increases of 3.81% and 4.29% through vertical integration. The results also show that access to credit, agricultural technology training, and the farmer's education level have significant positive impacts on farming income levels. The findings suggest ways to increase farmers' income by perfecting agricultural management organization systems, promoting agricultural industrialization, strengthening rural financial support, improving agricultural technical training for farmers, and increasing their level of education.",,10.1108/17561371111103543,China; Credit; Loans; Rural economics; Co-operative organizations

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the peasant household credit investigation system in Hubei RCCs and provide some evidence and ideas to the formulation of relevant policies. Design/methodology/approach - First, this paper briefly reviews the related literature of the efficiency in credit investigation system; second, the paper gives a brief description of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and designs the indicators for efficiency evaluation; third, the paper accounts data sources and processing methods; and finally, the paper performs the empirical analysis and draws a conclusion. Findings - The paper finds that the efficiency of the resource allocation in both regions is unoptimistic, the general efficiency is somewhat low, and it shows the trend of declination. The efficiency of pure technology in two regions represents the adverse trend. Every year's average scale efficiency in both regions is higher than the pure technology efficiency. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper include the first use of DEA model to practically evaluate the efficiency of credit investigation system based on 54 samples of RCCs in Hubei Province and the horizontal and vertical comparisons of the results. The conclusions of this paper not only make the efficiency of credit investigation system in the province's 54 credit cooperatives comparable but also has a great application value to the. actual decision-making departments in formulating credit policies, and each credit cooperative in further building the credit investigation system according to its own conditions.

Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called One Farm Household, Two Production Systems (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years. This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for Tamers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow Green Food are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides.",,,

Eastern Germany has a special advantage in producing bioenergy crops: the former agricultural cooperatives built up quite large farms with, compared to Western Germany, comparatively large fields. Therefore, a modelling study of the potential and the impacts of aspen SRC plantations in the five eastern federal states of Germany under the recent climate and future climate projections was conducted. The ecophysiological forest growth model 4C was used to simulate the growth of aspen SRC plantations and their impacts on carbon in soils, and groundwater recharge, on selected suitable areas currently under crops but with marginal site conditions for cropping. A clear signal to enhanced growth condition over the whole area can be seen in the simulation of the mean annual woody biomass yield under conditions of climate change, which increased from 7.47 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate to 9.26 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) at the end of the considered future period 2034-2055 under climate change. The mean soil carbon sequestration rate was 0.81 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate and could rise up to 0.93 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the assumption of climate change. On the other hand, the mean annual percolation rate, used as an indicator of impacts on the regional water budget, will diminish under future climatic conditions. The results suggest that aspen SRC plantations are a suitable contribution to regional CO2 mitigation and carbon sequestration under possible change of climate, but that negative impacts on the regional water budget are possible.",,10.3390/su10124368,rural households' behaviors; arable soil; heavy metal pollution assessment; Lankao county

Based on 101 field questionnaires of rural households in Lankao County and the monitoring data on heavy metal of arable soil of each rural household, the kind of rural households' behaviors which impose obvious influence on heavy metal content of arable soil are investigated via single-factor pollution index, Nemerow pollution index and econometric model in this study. The results show that, rural households' land utilization mode affects heavy metal content in soil, e.g., the degree of heavy metal pollution of soil for intensive planting is higher than that of traditional planting, viz. vegetable greenhouse > garlic land > traditional crop farmland. The management of cultivated land with due scale is beneficial to reducing heavy metal content in soil, that is, the land fragmentation degree is in direct proportion to heavy metal content in soil, so rural households are encouraged to carry out land circulation and combine the patch into a large one. Excess application of fertilizer, pesticide and organic fertilizer will lead to heavy metal pollution of soil, while agricultural technical training organized by government department and the foundation of agricultural cooperative can promote the technical level and degree of organization of rural households and enable them to be more scientific and rational in agrochemicals selection and application, hence reducing or avoiding heavy metal pollution of soil. Single factor pollution level of heavy metal in the soil for planting various crops is different, so it is recommended to prepare various pollution reduction programs for different land types and pollution levels for the harmony and unity of human-nature system.",,,supply chain risk; dairy agroindustry; fuzzy logic; knowledge base

Producers seeking broader marketing opportunities often turn to co-ops. This study examines how, within alternative food networks (AFNs), co-ops play a role in the emergence of the Domestic Fair Trade (DFT) movement in the USA. The DFT movement is based on the idea that family farms and small-to mid-sized farms in the global north are facing many of the same pressures as producers in the global south. The Domestic Fair Trade Association (DFTA) in the USA is the umbrella organization for a variety of stakeholders. The DFTA seeks to 'support family-scale farming, to reinforce farmer-led initiatives such as farmer co-operatives, and to bring these groups together with mission-based traders, retailers and concerned consumers to contribute to the movement for sustainable agriculture in North America'(1). This study assessed five co-ops (through interviews and document analysis) to determine their experiences with integrating DFT into their business practices. The research reveals that DFT concepts are important to co-operative decision-makers, but they are faced with challenges when it comes to actually integrating DFT into their business model. Insight into stakeholder perceptions and professional-level DFT activities, indicates that co-ops will be a key factor in determining whether the DFT movement will succeed in the USA.",,,rice production; farmers; efficiency; DEA; Myanmar; Ayeyarwaddy Regio

This study analyzed the profitability and efficiency of rice production in the Ayeyarwaddy Region of Myanmar and identified the influencing socioeconomic characteristics and farm-specific characteristics. Primary data from 130 randomly sampled farmers in the Ayeyarwaddy Region were collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and Tobit regression analysis. According to the average overall technical efficiency, farmers have an additional rice yield potential of 25 percent that can be attained by improving input utilization. The best practices benchmarked in the region showed that technical inefficiency is caused by excessive use of inputs, especially herbicides and animal power. Most rice farms in this study suffer from allocative and economic inefficiencies resulting from wrong combinations of input usages. The average economic efficiency level indicates that farmers can increase their profitability by 57 percent if they adapted to reduce input costs. Moreover, efficiency was significantly higher for farmers who were younger, better educated, more experienced, had access to agricultural extension services, and cultivated the Aye Yar Min variety. Efficiency can be improved by setting up farmers' cooperatives to increase the scale of operations. Moreover, the government should intervene to reduce input prices, control the quality of input seeds, and install an appropriate financial crop insurance mechanism. Effective and systematic agricultural extension services should be widespread to improve the efficiency and decision-making skills of rice farmers in the study area.",,10.1108/IJSE-06-2017-0231,Governance; Co-operatives; Financial crisis; Credit unions; Co-operative principles

Commentators suggested that co-operatives, in particular credit unions, could provide accountability and sustainability through their open governance and mutual status. However, such suggestions assumed that co-operative principles and practice continued to underpin the efficacy of co-operative banking, and that credit unions, one of the most prevalent forms of co-operative banking, could offer a viable financial alternative. Instead, in the case of Cyprus, the financial crisis and the associated aftershocks triggered the nationalisation and demutualisation of credit unions. This prompted the researchers to question both the viability of a co-operative banking future and the extent to which co-operative principles were shaping decision making, governance, accountability and sustainability. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was adopted to explore the degree to which co-operative principles still shaped credit union thinking and stakeholder relationships. Findings As is the case elsewhere within the co-operative movement, the findings point the fact that governance is weaken by the low membership participation and that the principles are no longer universally applied. Credit unions, if not co-operative banking, may not offer the financial assurances that commentators have called for. Moreover, the guiding principles may no longer be embedded within the fabric of the movement.

The increased popularity of entrepreneurship education toward the end of the twentieth century in many European welfare states is usually associated with a shift toward neoliberal, market-oriented, policies. It is argued here that an important reason for young entrepreneurship's success was its ability to connect with the Swedish tradition of cooperation and democratic decision making, in combination with values such as individualism and competition. A case in point is the surprising compatibility between progressive pedagogical ideas and neoliberal entrepreneurialism. The article is based on a study of Ung Foretagsamhet (Young Entrepreneurship, henceforth UF), the Swedish version of the American organization Junior Achievement, and the ambition of the consumer cooperative movement's think tank, Koopi, to offer a different kind of entrepreneurship education. In the analysis, the concept of the entrepreneurial self is applied to these two different programs, and the results show how they clashed, but also overlapped, in ways that help explain the success of UF.

The authors also consider the effect of farmer participation in cooperative-like organizations known as Farm Bases (FBs). Design/methodology/approach The authors use multiple list methods and elicitation strategies to measure Chinese apple farmers' risk attitudes and time preferences. Because these farmers can either sell their apples immediately to supermarkets or intermediaries or place them in storage, the authors assess correlations between their storage decisions and their preferences regarding risk and time. The authors also differentiate risks involving gains and losses and empirically examine individual risk attitudes in different scenarios. Findings Marketing decisions are moderately associated with risk attitudes but not time preference. Farmers with memberships in local farmer cooperatives are likely to speculate more in cold storage. Thus, risk aversion behavioral and psychological motives affect farmers' decision-making of cold storage and intertemporal marketing activities. However, membership in cooperatives does not always result in improved income and welfare for farmers. Research limitations/implications The research confirms that behavioral factors may strongly drive vulnerable smallholder farmers to speculate into storage even under seasonal and uncertain marketing volatility. There is the need to think deeper about the rationale of promoting cooperatives and other agricultural forms, because imposing these without careful consideration can have negative impacts. Originality/value Do risk and time preferences affect the decision of farmers to utilize storage facilities? This question is important because it is not clear if and how risk preferences affect the tradeoff between consuming today and saving for tomorrow, especially for farmers in developing countries.",,10.1108/JADEE-05-2021-0131,Agribusiness; Dairy cooperative; Case study; India; J54; Q13

Sitajakhala Dugdha Utpadak Samabai Samiti Limited (Sitajakhala Dairy Producers Cooperative Society Limited) is a successful cooperative society in the northeastern region of India. The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how the cooperative manages its production and supply chain of milk and milk products and highlights several issues that the cooperative encountered in the recent past and how those issues were managed. This case also illustrates how an agribusiness cooperative has been growing over the years, including expansion of business and the creation of a brand image, as well as benefiting its members and their communities. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a case study approach where they went for in-person interviews of Sitajakhala's executive members and office staff; in addition, the authors were given access to Sitajakhala's marketing and financial records as well as its annual reports and vision documents. Findings Sitajakhala Co-op provides a platform where individual dairy farmers (most of who are small farmers and many of them are illiterate) can unite to bargain for higher prices for their milk. Due to its member-oriented business strategy, Sitajakhala Co-op has been growing well with active support of its members. Consistent quality control and marked improvements in labeling, bottling and packaging of milk and milk products has helped the cooperative to establish itself as a leader in dairy products supplier in Assam among bulk buyers as well as individual consumers. Sitajakhala cooperative also provides dairy farming related services to its members for free of charge to improve milk production and quality. One of the shortcomings of the cooperative is underutilization of its modern milk processing plant which needs to be addressed by the management in earnest. Research limitations/implications This case study is based on information from one dairy cooperative in Assam, India; thus, the findings of this case may not translate into other dairy cooperatives in India or elsewhere. Nonetheless, cooperative practitioners may find the findings useful from a management perspective. Social implications Sitajakhala Co-op management was keenly aware of the non-dairy related needs of the community it serves. Some of such services include free medical ambulance service for its members, supporting secondary education through providing merit and need-based scholarships and funding physical improvements to a local high school and a local college. In addition, the cooperative regularly provides funding to local sports and cultural events and local social institutions which have positive impact on the larger community. Sitajakhala cooperative has been providing employment to the local youth in the Morigaon area and plans on continuing to do so. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case study focusing on the management and operations of a dairy cooperative in the northeastern part of India. Knowledge gained from such study is expected to benefit not only Sitajakhala cooperative but also other dairy cooperatives in a similar situation. This case study will also benefit senior undergraduate and/or graduate students specializing in agricultural economics/agribusiness and can also be used for executive training for the management of academic institutions and food companies.",,10.3390/su12166547,agri-food e-commerce; strategic alliance; supply chain extension; Multi-temperature Joint Distribution (MTJD); hybrid push-pull strategy; cooperation stability control

A theoretical framework of the HASC alliance is built with its organizational structure and schematics of the process of implementation strategies that cover the aspects of last-mile chain extension, food transportation, and production/distribution control. Furthermore, a three-step analytical method is proposed to analyze the performance of the alliance with the aim to provide appropriate strategies to hedge against the potential risks of cooperation instability. A hypothetical case is conducted, and the results show that: (1) the performance of the hypothetical HASC alliance with time shows significant variation in the beginning, but it gains stability with the application of stability control strategies; (2) the cooperation stability of HASC alliance is very sensitive to the performance of the strategies that control the customer and environment variations; (3) the factors of trust and market fluctuation have higher effects on membership and environmental stability, respectively; (4) the minimum and maximum cost ranges of control strategies at which the alliance can maintain its stability and performance are 5% and 29%, respectively, of the total operation cost.",,10.1093/cdj/bsx014,

Since the 1980s, over 3000 women-only dairy cooperative societies have been founded in Karnataka, India, with the objective of economically and socially empowering women. First we review the broader literature on gender and collective action in a development context and then empirically assess empowerment levels among fifty-eight female dairy farmers in Karnataka. We discriminate between membership and non-membership status in women-only versus mixed-gender dairy cooperatives and compare empowerment levels among those groups, borrowing categories from the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. We find that, in a context of rural poverty in which women-only cooperatives are promoted without offering additional development opportunities for men, the empowering effects remain limited to increased leadership abilities. Cooperative membership as such does not automatically enhance women's control over income or their intrahousehold decision-making power. In fact, members of women-only cooperatives perceive themselves as having even less control over dairy income and productive decisions compared with unorganized female dairy producers. These findings suggest that collective organizations in the dairy sector which systematically exclude men may fail to increase women's empowerment at the household level. At the same time, women face entry barriers to participation in mixed-gender cooperatives. We conclude that policies in support of women-only cooperatives and female members in mixed-gender cooperatives may require more rigorous evaluation.",,10.3390/su13158217,disclosure indicators; sustainability information; stakeholders; non-profit organizations

This study integrates problems of agency between principal-principal and conceptions of cooperativism. The centrality of the discussions lies in the potential conflict between borrowers and credit savers and their effect on performance.

In order to reach the objective of the research, multivariate data analysis was used as a technique with the use of panel data from 39 cooperatives affiliated to SICREDI, from 2008 to 2014. The data indicated that the dominance index is an influential factor and statistically significant return on assets (ROA).

Before making any credit decisions, credit analysis (the assessment of the financial history and financial backgrounds of the borrowers) should be completed as part of the screening process. Good borrowers with low credit risk would be granted a loan, while a high risk borrower would be denied. A good credit risk assessment assists financial institutions on loan pricing, determining the amount of credit, credit risk management, reduction of default risk and increase in debt repayment. The purpose of this paper is to develop a lending decision model (credit scoring) for the agricultural sector in Thailand. The data used in this study is from Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC), a major lender in Thailand agricultural sector. During the period of 2001 to 2003 a total of 16,560 agricultural loans were made available. The logistic regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to identify critical factors in lending decision process in the agricultural sector and to predict the borrower's creditworthiness (probability of a good loan). The results of the logistic regression verify the importance of total farm asset value, capital turnover ratio (efficiency), and the length of bank-borrower relationship (duration) as important factors in determining the creditworthiness of the borrowers. The results show that a higher value of farm assets implies a higher creditworthiness, which lead to a higher probability of a good loan. However, the negative signs found on both capital turnover ratio and the length of bank-borrower relationship (duration), which contradict with the hypothesized signs, suggest that the borrower with a longer relationship with the bank and a higher gross income to total assets has a higher probability to default on debt repayment. The overall prediction accuracy of the logistic lending decision models is above 85% on both in-sample and out-of-sample forecast, and is higher than the probabilistic neural network (PNN) model on out-of-sample forecast. However, the neural network models can detect Type I error (accepting a bad loan as a good loan) more accurately than the logistic models. The costs of classifying a bad loan as a good loan (Type I error) are more significant than the costs of misclassifying a good loan as a bad loan (Type II error). The overall prediction accuracy is not completely reliable since it ignores the relative cost difference between Type I and Type II errors. Thus, when the expected loss of misclassification is computed and compared, the results indicate that the misclassification cost of the PNN model is the best model with the lowest misclassification costs. In summary, the empirical results found in this study support the use of PNN model in classifying and screening agricultural loan applications in Thailand.",,,cooperation; co-operative movement; organizational identity; multiple identity; ideological identity

Their image has the Aurora Borealis dancing in the winter sky; the wonderful Denali National Park surrounding the tallest mountain in North America, Mt. McKinley (20,320 feet); and, abundant wildlife in all parts of the state. All of these images symbolize the beauty of nature where man's power doesn't reach. Alaska is the largest state in the U.S. at 591,000 square miles and is larger than Texas, California and Montana combined. Alaska's environment zones include the Arctic, sub-Arctic and rainforest. Each area presents many challenges for its communities such as solid waste disposal, recycling and wastewater treatment. The greatest challenge for these three issues is in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions for Alaska's 200+ remote villages. Even transportation in remote areas comes with unique complications and considerations that are not apparent at first - such as the wide utilization of 4-wheelers and snow machines in the Arctic and sub-Arctic as well as boats in the Southeast rainforest. Seagoing barges from Seattle bring fuel oil, gasoline, food supplies, building supplies, vehicles and other necessities to coastal and Yukon River villages. Circumstances unique to Alaska with its huge landmass and different environmental zones are not experienced in the Lower 48 states or in countries such as in Japan where space is limited and recycling is critical. Part of the answer to assist remote rural communities to address all these issues involves the transfer and utilization of NEW Technology as well as the application of other Educational Technologies and Processes to assist the transfer process. Distance, costs, culture, population size, etc. are all factors that become very relevant to the success of the endeavor. Prior to 1959 - The early years - to augment face-2-face and class room/workshop sessions, there was radio, telephone, and mail as the means of communication. The dog sled in winter and bush planes were the common mode of transportation between villages. These were the limitations when we discuss information/technology dissemination methodologies.

The areas are exploited to produce inefficiently, and so is the system of incentives and subsidies. Therefore, Croatia is highly dependent on food imports. Although there are still one in three people living in agricultural households, only a few food products are being produced in quantities sufficient for national needs. On food imports such as the one in 2008, Croatia has spent $ 1.5 billion. Rural areas occupy about 85 percent of the territory, and 85 percent of villages are affected by depopulation. Residents of rural areas are characterized by increasing life expectancy and a fifth of the rural population aged between 25 and 40 years wants to move to the cities. In fact, almost half of agricultural land is classified in the group threatened by erosion. Nearly a third of all agricultural land suffers from acidity. More and more farmland is lost by converting agricultural land into construction land. For these reasons, the strategic goal of increasing agricultural production will not be easy to achieve. To achieve this we need to change priorities in national policy towards agriculture and rural areas. It is considered that a major obstacle in the way of raising productivity is the small area (approximately 1.9 hectares) owned by agricultural households. These households, on the other hand, have approximately 80 percent of agricultural resources. Fragmentation of agricultural land does not adopt the global economy, but emphasizes large, easier and faster cost-effective systems. Small agricultural households are facing destruction, and without them there is no life in rural areas and caring for the environment. The imperative to raise productivity in agriculture comes into conflict with the objectives of rural development and sustainable development. In order to counter such trends, the EU wants to use incentives to adjust small and medium-sized farms to market conditions. However, the distributional impact of incentives is such that large manufacturers picked the most money, rather than small and medium producers. This effect leads to land consolidation, the creation of large landowners and the development of profitable food industry. Deregulation and the promotion of competitiveness in agriculture and food industry further complicate the survival of viable rural communities. In surviving villages, the EU wants to develop the competitiveness and diversification of agricultural production in rural households (e. g. tourism and rural crafts). In this paper we explore the ambivalence of European agricultural policy and its impact on Croatian agriculture and countryside, and try to answer the question whether this policy, in the case of Croatia, will lead to the collapse of local agriculture, the disappearance of rural communities and food price increases. Based on experiences of other countries and theoretical models, the paper gives outlines of a national agricultural policy which would, for example, through the development of cooperatives and clusters protect family farms and households living in rural areas. At the same time such a policy could affect the increase in agricultural yield and income of small and medium-sized farmers.",,,Cooperative Organizations; Board Size; Board meetings; cooperative governance; Performance

However, cooperatives like their business cousins in the public corporations have been plagued with governance issues (Shaw, 2006). This has prompted studies to isolate the probable causes of their predicament. The issue of corporate governance of cooperatives has begun to become mainstream in research and conventional wisdom dictates that governance procedures and processes that abound in the corporate world can prudently be applicable in the governance of cooperatives (Cornforth; 2004). In a cooperative the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the collective interest of the members (Jussila, Goel, & Tuominen, 2012). Board of Directors need to demonstrate adequate and effective monitoring of organizations they are helming. This paper examines how the board of directors can act as a custodian against financial fiasco in cooperatives organizations. Our study focuses on the association of size of Board of Directors of cooperatives and the frequency of board meetings with performance. Outcomes from the study indicated both the size of the board and the frequency of board meetings has no relationships with performance of cooperatives organizations in Malaysia. The results suggest that the board of directors may no longer be effective in managing the cooperatives towards achieving their members' objectives. Various literatures supported this finding.

The aim of this paper is to explore the agricultural context of Rome, focusing on its relationships with development in the metropolitan area, within the framework of sustainable food planning. Starting from the relationship between food and city, we have mapped the foodscape, identifying a number of representative conditions - typologies - in the metropolitan area of Rome. Through a of criteria - relationships with the urban fabric, production patterns, flows, services, infrastructures, environmental characters, social behaviour linked with the production - the study tries to summarise Roman agriculture. We focus on a set of recurring elements, involving both criticalities and opportunities, that bring together city and food production. Rome has what we could call a compact structure compared to the dispersed urban model and this has encouraged the development of local agricultural systems, where both flows and landscapes involve the city. While production is organised into wedge-shaped areas, the places where exchanges occur are mainly within the municipal area of Rome, with the exception of farms involved in direct sales. Despite a strong urbanization pressure caused a reduction of 42% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) between 1990 and 2000, this trend was reverted back between 2000 and 2010, with an increase of the UAA of 14%. The analysis of land use (CLC, 2006) reveals a system of wedge-shaped agricultural areas, where short supply chain models can be used efficiently to manage and promote the use of land and landscape. In synthesis, in terms of their production systems, there is a high number of short supply chain farms in Rome (over 40%), mostly with mixed production systems linked to multifunctional farming. The role played by the local food network in Rome is remarkable, particularly in case of farmers' market, SPG' and those linked to box schemes experiences have seen significant success. The increasing importance of Alternative and Local Food Networks is showed in the data: the 60% of Rome municipalities farms sell directly (Istat, 2010) it was registered an increase of + 57% Farmers' market at municipality level and of + 64% in Rome's province (2010/13) (Marino et al., 2013). The local food network behind agriculture in the city, within a number of integrated social agrarian cooperative, who represented an alternative food production system and landmark for many initiatives carried out by the civil society, associations, cooperatives, volunteer and school sectors, community supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives. This account of short supply chains in Rome is inevitably the account of an urban phenomenon. It is indeed the city that determines its special characteristics for both physical and relational aspects. The mapped farms are mostly located near the main routes that radiate from the city to the countryside, underlining the centrality of the flow of exchanges that take place with the city. The processes of transformation affecting the primary sector in urban and suburban environments reflect an agriculture that forms (and produces) new landscape and functions, typically reconnected to the historical value of agriculture in and around the Mediterranean cities. Food, because of its cultural and historical place in Mediterranean tradition, has a significant role in configuring the areas where exchanges takes place, which are, therefore, specific places for meeting and forming relationships within the public spaces of a city. The system identified by the paper configures the set of all the different forms of agriculture and food in Rome as a device of resilience for the city, made up of places where flows, relationships and processes become increasingly more sustainable, and where both physical and intangible spaces act as an infrastructure in their exchange with the city.

In the general context of sustainable development, to achieve this objective, of the needs of rural microfinance, implementation of economic models that gives an impulse to align this area to the market economy principles and requirements is essential. The models must be adapted to the concrete and real needs of those who are living and working in rural areas. Being at the start of this research theme that I want to draw, I realize that such a challenge is both difficult and subject to the risk that some of the advanced ideas may not be in the accordance with the current financing policy of decision makers. Beyond these considerations, is necessary to disclose that to the level of community states, this dynamic market is still quite heterogeneous because of the institutional and legislative disparity and also because of very diversified microcredit providers. In the EU, microcredit is provided by financial institutions regulated by the Central Banks and those unregulated by the Central Bank, but covered by Community Directives, such as commercial banks, savings banks, cooperative banks and public banks. To these are added a number of non-banking institutions namely microfinance institutions, enterprises specialized in microfinance, foundations, credit unions, charities, NGOs and others. It should be underlitied that the 2014-2020 Romanian rural development strategy, in the context of the 2020 Europe, strategy is a strategy of economic growth with objectives for a smart economy, sustainable and favorable to social inclusion and the improvement of agricultural and non -agricultural SME's competitiveness from the countryside. The scientific approach that I try to define starts from the fact that the Romanian rural area, a total of 2.7 million peasant households, which together account for more than 5 million hectares or 34 percent of the agricultural area of the country is outside the current system of agricultural financing. They are added 2 million people in rural areas without any plot of land, without a job, who live in extreme poverty. Transferring these european ideas in the Romanian context and correlating it with the statistic economic situation in Romania, I believe that through the creation of economic models of microfinance and in accordance with current regulatory framework, we can contribute to the sustainable development of this considerable potential that we identified in rural Romania.",,,Cooperative; governance; socio-economic; competitiveness

An effective organisational control structure, which includes fraud control, will assist an entity to promote ethical and business practices, improve accountability and contribute to quality outcomes. This paper therefore aims to highlight the issues and challenges faced by cooperative organisations worldwide and aspire to suggest that cooperatives will need to embark on governance in order to be successful in the dynamic environment.

Although water-saving technologies (WSTs) have been introduced for decades, sustained commitment to WST is not being met. This paper investigates factors affecting adoption and sustained adoption of WST based on 261 households in the North China Plain. We employ Heckman's two-stage sample selection process: (1) households decide whether to adopt WST or not and (2) households decide whether to sustainably adopt (adopt for a long time) WST or not. Particular attention is paid to the role of water scarcity in the initial adoption and sustained adoption stages. Several indicators relating to water scarcity are used to calculate a water scarcity index based on principal component analysis. The results showed that water scarcity exerts a significant and positive effect on both adoption and sustained adoption of WST. Non-adopters and non-sustained adopters face less severe water scarcity than adopters. Membership in cooperative organizations significantly improves the likelihood of sustained adoption; 63.6% of sustained adopters have a membership in cooperative organizations, compared with 18.2% of non-sustained adopters. The number of plots negatively affects the sustained adoption of WST; sustained adopters on average have 3.0 plots, and non-sustained adopters have 5.3 plots. Education, extension service, farm size, off-farm work, relatives working in the local government and irrigation costs are positively and significantly associated with adoption and sustained adoption decisions. Finally, we find that labor-saving capacity significantly influences both stages, whereas capital-saving capacity is only significant in the adoption stage. Only 10% of non-adopters consider adoption of WST as more labor- and capital-saving than conventional irrigation practices, in comparison with nearly 50% of adopters. These results imply that the extension of WST should consider focusing more on cooperative organizations and hold more demonstrations for farmers. Moreover, given that the degree of water shortage varies from region to region, the WST extension standards should vary accordingly. Governments should strengthen awareness by enhancing education and publicity concerning water scarcity and conservation.",,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2005.10.004,moshav; rural space; Israel; economic and social transformation

An analysis of the changes that have taken place in the moshav in the past few decades reveals a process of rural restructuring, similar to that which is occurring in many developed countries. New economic activities have replaced farming as sources of income, and newcomers, mostly of urban origin, have invaded rural communities in search of a better quality of life. These changes derive from a combination of structural changes in agriculture, changing government policies and cumulative decisions of rural households. The result is a more heterogeneous moshav-physically, economically and socially, and growing regional, inter-village and intra-village disparities. These developments have a direct impact on the organizational structure of the moshav, its environmental qualities and its exchange relations with the urban sector. As part of the ongoing process of change the moshav is gradually losing some of its unique features, which formed the basis for its identity as a special type of rural community. This leads to the question of whether the moshav will be able to develop a new identity as a distinct type of rural community, or turn into a suburban or urban community. The answer will depend largely on the direction taken by government policy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a case study approach, we investigate the everyday practices of three farmer cooperatives. We show that farmer cooperatives are capable of establishing or joining quality food networks, but the benefits are often limited because of their weak position or instability of the network. Building strong alliances with other network actors is difficult because of cooperatives' limited communication capacity and lack of economic and social capital.

Since these variables are heterogeneous, the review process carried out by credit analysts takes time. The objective of this article is to propose a solution for this problem by applying fuzzy logic to the creation of classification rules for credit granting. To achieve this, linguistic variables were used to help the analyst interpret the information available from the credit officer. The method proposed here combines the use of fuzzy logic with a neural network and a variable population optimization technique to obtain fuzzy classification rules. It was tested with three databases from financial entities in Ecuador - one credit and savings cooperative and two banks that grant various types of credits. To measure its performance, three benchmarks were used: accuracy, number of classification rules generated, and antecedent length. The results obtained indicate that the hybrid model that is proposed performs better than its previous versions due to the addition of fuzzy logic.

We use a critical institutionalist approach, called bricolage, to show how in both cases farmers organize sustainable market access by blending novel arrangements with existing institutions embedded in social and economic relations.

Promoting the stable collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain is an urgent problem. Considering the characteristic demand of consumers for agricultural products, this paper takes the supply chain mainly operating characteristic agricultural products and dominated by farmer cooperatives as the research object and constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of farmer cooperatives, manufacturers, and retailers. We study the supply chain collaboration mechanism from the main strategy choice and the specific factors affecting its strategy choice. The results show that farmer cooperatives implement a strict supervision strategy and increase the reward and punishment to promote the collaboration in the supply chain, but the increase in supervision cost is not conducive to the income of farmer cooperatives. In the case of loose supervision, the difference between the additional income and the collaboration input is higher than the free-rider income obtained when adopting a non-collaboration strategy, which is conducive to its evolution towards collaboration. In addition, increasing additional income, improving synergy coefficient, and reducing collaboration input and free-rider income will increase the probability of the system evolving to Pareto optimal, and accelerate the realization of comprehensive collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain dominated by farmer cooperatives.

The objective of this study was to test low-cost, easy-to-implement modifications to a locally available convection dryer, to improve its energy efficiency. Experiments were conducted in cooperation with a Hmong farmers' cooperative in Northern Thailand. Insulation of the air ducts and control of the air recirculation rate led to energy cost savings of US$2.45 per dryer-load.

Hermes fervently believed that public control over industry and government would revitalize democratic institutions and eradicate political repression, institutionalized racism, and corporate capitalism. Established in 1941 as a cooperative grocery store for working-class Preset Neighborhood residents, the Consumers' Co-operative Union (CCU) was the physical manifestation of Hermes's utopian vision. For more than twenty years, the CCU was a space for exchanging local and national ideas about economic cooperation, racial justice, and political reform. Indeed, Hermes depended on afar-reaching New Deal support network that transcended his neighborhood and bridged political, racial, gender, and class divides. However, this coalition disintegrated in the face of white flight, anti-Communist hysteria, and urban economic decline in the 1950s. I contend that while particular depression-era neighborhood politics nurtured the CCU, larger national economic, political, and cultural trends ultimately confounded the cooperative's ability to create sustained economic change in Freret.",,10.1086/657907,

The literature reports that firms are increasingly entering into long-term, high dependency exchanges as a result of increased demand for quality goods, demand for variability of goods, demand for constant innovation, severe price competition and increasing technology costs. These changes are forcing firms to enter into complex relationships with other firms in order to remain competitive. Examples of such relationships are: relational contracting, network organisations, strategic alliances and horizontal co-operation. The increase in number and complexity of these exchanges in an environment characterised by uncertainty has led to the increased interest in the use of obligation contracting. Furthermore, this interest has been reinforced by the changing nature of products being exchanged. More knowledge-based products and information-based modes of production necessitate the sharing of strategically sensitive data. Hence the rise of importance of obligation contracting is not only due to the increased number of complex exchanges in uncertain environments, but also the very nature of the goods being exchanged.",,10.1080/08865655.2021.1943493,Borderland cooperation; disaster risk management; former Soviet Union states; Central Asia; transboundary issues

Cheese and cereal consumers also indicate a general willingness to pay for product origin and family ownership attributes, but the effects are not always compatible with farmer cooperatives. Overall, although price premiums for cooperative brands and labels may exist across various product categories, the heterogeneity in willingness to pay estimates for other product attributes is suggestive of the difficulties farmer cooperatives face in pursuit of product differentiation.

The variance of the effect in different sectors, i.e. crop, forestry, husbandry, fishery and services, is investigated. Design/methodology/approach Provincial-level panel data from 2007 to 2017 are used for this study. A linear dynamic panel regression model is estimated using multiple estimation methods, i.e. the generalized method of moments (GMMs), fixed-effect model and ordinary least squares (OLS) are applied. Findings The empirical analyses indicate that the role of the government is important for the development of farmer cooperatives but limited in some specific aspects. First, the coverage of financial support is positively associated with the growth of cooperative population and membership size, but the strength of financial support, measured by the total amount of financial support divided by local agricultural gross domestic product (GDP), has no statistically significant effects on the development of cooperatives. Second, financial support does not exhibit significant influence on the revenue of cooperatives. Third, the magnitude of the effect of government support on cooperative development is heterogeneous across different sectors. Originality/value The research study adds to the institutional economics literature on the association between institutional environment and organization development by focusing on a particular and an important type of organization, i.e. farmer cooperatives. It is one of the attempts and a most extensive study to empirically investigate the role of financial support in the development of farmer cooperatives.",,,Informatization; SaaS; Model; Specialized Farmers Cooperatives; Logistics

The many state organizations that were previously involved in providing water management services in the drinking water, hydropower and irrigation sectors have been consolidated into autonomous and accountable private, public or cooperative organizations, supported by an improving legal framework and an emerging regulatory capacity. This process has already led to improvements in operational performance. To activate overall water resources management, the Water Resources Management Agency (WRMA) and its five River Basin Management Organizations (BMOs) were recently established under the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP), which has a broad natural resources mandate. In this paper, it is argued that the current single biggest challenge of the MNP is to revitalize water resources monitoring, water use permitting and enforcement, which will be essential for future basin planning and management. This will require that the MNP streamline cooperation among its various monitoring and enforcement agencies and the WRMA/BMOs. At the same time, financial mechanisms need to be designed to finance these basic water resources management needs, so that they are sustainable.

The presence of microbial agents, toxic animal and plant products and chemical contamination remain because of the existence of small and dispersed farmers, who are not educated to use agricultural inputs correctly. This inability raises the issue of safety control in the agricultural sector. This study proposes that cooperatives' self-inspection of agricultural products before they enter the market can better organize small farmers to utilize a standardized production and safety management system. Therefore, we attempt to explore the factors that influence farmer cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. An Ordered Logistic Regression Model is employed to estimate the factors that influence cooperatives' choices of inspection frequency. The results show that the respondents expressed a medium to high level of implementing self-inspection but a lower level of concern in testing products by batch. The regression results indicate that subjective norms from the social environment, the perceived behavioral control of managers, ability and rules including input management, production documentation, and social demographic variables, significantly affect cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. The future implementation of safety inspection depends on the extent to which subjective norms, ability, and internal rules can improve agri-product safety in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The principal-agent relationship of Chinese farmer cooperatives has its own characteristics. By constructing theoretical models of agent incentives which suit for Chinese farmer cooperatives, and based on it, this paper analyzes those related factors, and discovers that the degree of effort made by the core members is inversely proportional to their rents obtained; the incentive for core members' effort has positive correlation with the proportion of their own agricultural products to the total; the higher proportion that the core members shares is, the larger the incentive for them is, the higher the degree of their effort is, and the higher output and surplus to be distributed are.

This article explores how the order of worth framework has been applied to empirical studies of organizations. First, I summarize the basic ideas of the framework, stressing the aspects of special relevance for studies of organizations. Second, I review the empirical studies focusing on the coexistence of competing orders of worth in organizations showing that the order of worth framework primarily has been related to three main themes in organizational research: non-profit and co-operative organizations, inter-organizational co-operation, and organizational change. Third, I discuss how the pragmatic, process-oriented aspect of the research program, focusing on the intertwining of values and action in various forms of 'justification work', has been translated into empirical studies.

The findings show that FCs cover a wide range of knowledge intermediation and innovation intermediation functions identified by the literature. FCs recognize the importance to connect technical, social and economic dimensions of farming practice and provide corresponding services to link farmers to relevant actors, like extension agencies, research institutes and supermarkets. Though they mainly work through bilateral relationships as opposed to acting as a systemic intermediary, they could take the role of coordinator in the service system and bridge the gap between the research and policy system and everyday farming practice, especially in the absence of a systemic coordinator.

The perception is now commonly held that it is necessary to radically rethink the entire set up of the institutional school towards a more flexible, adaptable and co-operative organization (Irgens and Jensen in Skolen som kunnskapsorganisasjon. Utdanning, nr.3,1. februar, 2008). This paper explores an empirical case, where a school is implementing a device called 'flexible timetables' in an attempt to depart from former fixed structures and private teaching practices. By combining process thought and liminality theory, the paper offers a theoretical framework for understanding some of the dynamics and unintended consequences of this transformation process. In so doing the paper calls attention to some important limits to the vision of flexibility and openness that informs this program of organisational change and subjectivity. Flexible timetables are conceptualized as a liminal affective technology (Stenner and Moreno-Gabriel in Subjectivity 6(3):229-253, https://doi.org/10.1057/sub.2013.9, 2013), designed to disrupt structures supporting former institutional practices, and to engender circumstances that are describable in terms of liminal experience. We use the concept of liminal affectivity to describe the collective atmosphere of ambivalence and volatility that is summoned through the intervention. We also draw attention to certain unexpected side effects, as when the participants experience themselves both paralysed by the ensuing paradoxes, and captured in dynamics of polarisation (Greco and Stenner in Theory Psychol 27(2):147-166, https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354317 693120, 2017).

Shrimp farmers' cooperative societies operate in only 13.3% of the studied areas and only 15% of shrimp farmers are involved with these cooperative societies. The results reveal that shrimp diseases, price and availability of quality shrimp seeds, exploitation by intermediaries and uncertainty about the future demand for shrimp in foreign markets are perceived as the most important sources of risk. On the other hand, prevention of disease, timely supply of shrimp seeds, elimination of middlemen from the supply chain and farm management training are considered among the best methods to manage the risks in the shrimp-farming business. We also observe some disparities in farmers' perceptions. For instance, farmers mentioned that removal of influence of middlemen from supply chain is essential for the betterment of their business. However, they did not consider market monitoring, direct contract with processors and improved marketing facilities as important risk management strategies, although these factors play a significant role in reducing the influence of intermediaries and private money lenders.",,10.1177/1350508414537623,Cooperative organizations; cooperative principles; decoupling; Mondragon; worker-owned organizations

Despite its economic success, this experience has also been wrought with its own share of tensions and internal paradoxes. Surprisingly, the perspective of worker-member-owners in the analysis of those inconsistencies in Mondragon has been given very little prominence. Similarly, the equivalence between the formal policies defined in that experience and the day-to-day activity has been widely taken for granted in the literature. This article aims to fill this gap and contribute to the literature by analyzing the extent to which Mondragon's basic cooperative principles are applied in the daily practice from the perspective of worker-member-owners. To that end, in-depth interviews were conducted with worker-member-owners of Mondragon outside their working environment. An interpretative analysis provides evidence of a decoupling of cooperative principles from the workers' daily activity. Furthermore, a tacit and non-formal principle frequently surfaces in the interviews: the principle of the primacy of secure membership and guaranteed employment. This seems to be the most solid tie that binds members to their organization, in a context with growing individualization and precarious employment conditions, together with a ubiquitous managerial discourse that encourages shallow forms of workplace participation. This work contributes to the broader field of organizational theory and sheds light on the dissociation process in formal policies of organizations governed by alternative founding principles.

Furthermore, the presence of a central position is due to members having a function as owners and users of cooperative service. Member education, as one of the cooperative principles, is necessary because the members' knowledge of the cooperative will support the role or central position of the members. Efforts to implement member education, among others, are implemented by means of best practice development.

The findings of the research indicate that the analysis of best practices is in line with the stages of development of cooperative organizations as part of member education. Best practice, in establishing Rukun Ibu for example, gives awareness to members to avoid lending activities. In addition, best practice at development stage is emphasized on member education.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon nine in-depth interviews and naturalistic observations in an urban village of Guangzhou, China, the study empirically investigates how unregulated sidewalk-based hawkers struggle to survive against socioeconomic adversities compared with regulated vendors' operations in a legitimate transitional market. Findings Mirroring a sub-group of rural-to-urban migrants, street vendors espouse subtle strategies centering on purposefulness, resourcefulness and hardiness, which are instantiated through family obligation, sales tactics, merchandising techniques, technology application, trading flexibility, moral sentiment and assistance network. As such, street entrepreneurs are both enacting and constructing resilience in response to specific challenging contexts including impoverishment, operating cost inflation, contingent loss, fierce competition, market uncertainty, intensive workloads, municipal inspection and arbitrary governance practice of village cooperative organization.

To examine the impact of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management, we built binary logistic models and Tobit models by applying a sample survey data of 500 households in rural Jiangxi in 2018. Households' participation and investment in forest management were measured by their labor and cash input. The results indicated that more off-farm laborers in household would hold back their participation in cash input. In contrast, a higher rate of female off-farm employment encouraged household monetary input. And households with more female agricultural laborers were more likely to participate in labor input. Neither off-farm employment nor female off-farm employment significantly influences households' labor input. Off-farm employment of the householder negatively influenced labor and cash input. Policy factors, such as obtaining forestry subsidies and forestry loans, joining forestry co-operative organizations, and better attitude to the logging quota system, also promoted households' participation and investment in forest management. Household head's age and education, forestry land status also affected participation in forest management. Our analysis could provide basis for managers to formulate policies to support sustainable forest management. Recommendations for Resource Managers: The econometric models applied in this research could reflect the influence of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management behavior and provide a quantitative basis for formulating forest management policies. There were great differences between rural households' forest management cash input behavior and labor input behavior and households were more active in labor input compared with cash input.

Also, the article discusses legal environment, government attitude and development trends of credit unions' in Poland. In conclusion, the de lege ferenda postulates regarding credit unions' regulation in Poland are presented. Credit unions in Poland conduct not for profit business activity only with their members with reservation to mediating in specific contracts on financial market which can be also conducted with nonmembers. Credit unions activity is subject to supervision of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (FSA). Therefore credit unions regulation is characterized by duality of legal regime of private and administrative law. However, in certain fields of credit unions activity the FSA's supervision, performed under administrative legal regime, raises justified doubts in the light of the principle of cooperative autonomy as the FSA by law has the authority to impose specific orders and prohibitions on credit unions.",,10.1108/IJPPM-10-2017-0250,Performance; Balanced scorecard; Supply chain management

Design/methodology/approach Data used in this study were primary data collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires with 1-5 Likert scale. The sample consisted of the representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in Central Java Province, representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in West Java Province and some farmers who are members of those dairy cooperatives. This study uses balanced supply chain management scorecard for measuring the performance of dairy supply chain, importance-performance analysis (IPA) for identifying the indicators that are most in need of improvement, and strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) analysis for formulating strategic planning. Findings The results of balanced supply chain management scorecard combined with IPA analysis showed that the performance relationship between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in West Java Province is slightly better than that in Central Java Province. It can be seen from the average value of the score of indicator, the category of each indicator and the category of the performance index of each relationship. The major weakness of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province lies in the different perspective (no perspective is dominant), whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer. On the other hand, the major strength of the relationship in Central Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer, whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of learning and growth. Research limitations/implications The limitation of this study is related to the number of the dairy cooperatives as the sample and the type of scale used to measure the performance of the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and individual milk processors. So, the future research may replicate this study by surveying all the dairy cooperatives in Central Java and West Java Provinces. It may also enhance the measurement of the performance of the relationships by using a direct measure of each indicator in each perspective, rather than recording the management of dairy cooperative perceptions. Practical implications This research provides essential insights for the management of dairy cooperative in the context of strategic planning development. The research reveals that there is a different strategic planning for improving the performance of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in each province. It depends on the major weakness and strength of the relationships, and also, opportunity and threat faced by the dairy industry. One important thing, the management of dairy cooperative in both provinces should have strategic planning related to the use of machine milking by farmers to improve the milk quality. Social implications The research revealed that strategic planning could be built after analyzing the internal and external conditions carefully. It may encourage more dairy cooperatives to measure and analyze the internal and external conditions at the bottom of strategic planning of their business. Originality/value Although this research only used the balanced supply chain management scorecard and IPA analysis for measuring the performance, and SWOT analysis in formulating the strategic planning for improving the current performance, it will make a difference. First, instead of measuring the performance of dairy cooperatives, this research measured the performance of the relationships between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors. This way, the dairy cooperatives were only sources of data collection. Second, the investigation was quite complicated since the objects of the research were represented by the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province and West Java Province.",,,Public Policy; Family Farmers; PNAE

To enhance the level of farmers' participation, it is important to accelerate farmers' cooperative behavior by fostering the social circumstance of cooperation, providing technical support and establishing land transferring mechanism.

A case study of the COATO farming cooperative showed us that its environmental management, focused on prevention logic, has had a positive net effect on its environmental performance. Besides, the order in which these practices were adopted favoured the development of new organisational capabilities that have contributed to the appearance of advantages derived from the greater accumulated experience of employees in creating new projects that are designed to reduce residues and pollution. COATO has also obtained a competitive advantage in differentiation thanks to an improved brand image and to its increased credibility in business relationships. Finally, a positive correlation exists between the pioneering proactive strategy adopted by this cooperative and the improvement of its firm performance with respect to the other firms in its sector.

Certified households were also compared with a non-certified group in each country. To analyze the differences in coffee price, volume, gross revenue and education between certifications, we used the Kruskal-Wallis ( K-W) non-parametric test and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test as a post-hoc procedure. Household savings, credit, food security and incidence of migration were analyzed through Pearson's chi-square test. Our study corroborated the conditions of economic poverty among small-scale coffee farmer households in Central America and Mexico. All certifications provided a higher price per pound and higher gross coffee revenue than non-certified coffee. However, the average volumes of coffee sold by individual households were low, and many certified farmers did not sell their entire production at certified prices. Certifications did not have a discernable effect on other livelihood-related variables, such as education, and incidence of migration at the household level, although they had a positive influence on savings and credit. Sales to certified markets offer farmers and cooperatives better prices, but the contribution derived from these premiums has limited effects on household livelihoods. This demonstrates that certifications will not single-handedly bring significant poverty alleviation to most coffee-farming families. Although certified coffee markets alone will not resolve the livelihood challenges faced by smallholder households, they could still contribute to broad-based sustainable livelihoods, rural development and conservation processes in coffee regions. This can be done by developing more active partnerships between farmers, cooperatives, certifications and environmental and rural development organizations and researchers in coffee regions. Certifications, especially Fair Trade/organic, have proven effective in supporting capacity building and in serving as networks that leverage global development funding for small-scale coffee-producing households.",,10.1016/j.amc.2018.02.017,Fishery management; Marketing cooperative; Oligopoly; Evolutionary game dynamics

Unlike these studies, the present paper deals with a marketing cooperative of micro or small enterprises in fishing industry, formed to negotiate a contracted price with large buyers, sharing risk among members of the cooperative. In the paper a game-theoretical model for the behaviour in this cooperative is set up. By the time of the actual commercialization of the product, the market price may be higher than what the cooperative can guarantee for members, negotiated on beforehand. Therefore some unfaithful members may be interested in selling at least a part of their product on the free market, the cooperative, however, can punish them for this. This conflict is modelled with a multi-person normal form game. An evolutionary dynamics is proposed for the continuous change of the applied strategies, which in the long term leads to a particular Nash equilibrium, considered the solution of the game. This strategy dynamics is continuously influenced by an exosystem describing the dynamics of fishing, based on a classical fishing effort model. This approach focuses only on the conflict within the marketing cooperative, since it is supposed that the single enterprises fish from independent resources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The historical analysis, which was based on the political settlements framework, has shown that the policies implemented in the cocoa sector went through four periods. The colonial era was characterised by a fairly corporate governance system and struggle between European traders and farmer cooperatives for monopoly over internal marketing of cocoa. This was followed by the early post-independence era (1957-1980), which was characterised by neopatrimonialism and over-taxation of cocoa farmers. The third phase (1980-2000) witnessed economic reforms and liberalisation. The fourth phase (2000 to present) saw increased public-private partnerships aimed at empowering women and promoting environmentally friendly farming activities. The paper concludes that the policies in the cocoa sector have, historically, created more benefits (rents) to political elite and their crony capitalists. Given that rent-seeking behaviour is a threat to the sustainability of the cocoa sector, the paper urges international development partners and civil society groups to demand greater accountability and transparency from the political elite and state institutions in the cocoa sector.",,10.1093/rcfs/cfac020,

Moreover, banks were more likely to fail, and had higher delinquency and net charge-off ratios immediately following the financial crisis. Our empirical models control for important differences between credit unions and banks including firm-level characteristics, borrower-level characteristics, and state-level economic conditions. We argue that the remaining difference captures the effects of credit unions' nonprofit and cooperative structure, which encourages them to internalize the utility of their customer-owners.

Then, we link the size of the membership with the concept of social capital. For our purposes, it is necessary to depart from using a general concept of social capital and to differentiate between bonding and bridging social capital. Our results, based on two unique datasets from Poland, clearly showed that relatively larger POs have higher rates of survival. This, in turn, is correlated with the stock and the type of social capital. The main contribution of the study is in identifying the relevance of the size of the membership of newly-established POs to their survival. The findings are followed by policy recommendations that may be useful in the context of promoting farmers' cooperation in recognizing the low stock of social capital, specifically bridging social capital.",,,

However, all IARCs participate in seed sector improvement in various ways, e.g., production of small quantities of breeder/basic seed; technical advice on seed production to NARS, public and private companies, NGOs, and farmers' cooperatives; monitoring adoption and seed production of released varieties; assessing constraints to seed multiplication and marketing; training of seed sector staff; information dissemination through brochures and seed production manuals; and provision of policy advice to governments.",,10.1108/S1057-192220170000024003,Financialization; agri-food system; chicken industry; deregulation; private integration; Norway

Data were collected from the 100 largest credit unions from nine Canadian provinces and assessed through qualitative content analysis. Results show that Canadian credit unions have implemented accommodative and proactive approaches when addressing COVID-19, through more operational than financial actions directed to their clients and employees, and that those with larger assets implement a greater number of actions compared to credit unions with smaller assets. More importantly, results show that traditional CSR2 approaches (e.g., RDAP) do not fit unexpected crises, so novel approaches are required to face future crises and remain resilient.

That is, we will determine whether its application will increase the bank's assertiveness in identifying credit unions whose managers have taken discretionary actions which diverge from regulatory standards Method: Benford's Law was applied to all singular Brazilian credit unions from 2006 to 2017 - which is a relevant timeframe due to regulatory changes - for Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Cash, and LPCSL (Loss Provisions for Client/Credit accounts which have Suspicious Liquidations) accounts over various timeframes. Relevance: The discussed evidence offers elements that can improve regulation mechanisms, and it can also indicate whether managers are using their discretionary power to influence singular credit union performance Results: Time is an important factor in the use of this tool. Applications applied over a long period of time do not capture discretionary actions taken by managers due to potential adjustments made to variations over time. An annual timeframe makes it possible to use this technique to capture potential discretionary actions taken in the examined accounts. In addition, this technique generates a consistent list of credit unions which require more intense surveillance and/or investigation. It also indicates that the norms revised in 2015 have helped reduce incentives to manage earnings and/or commit fraud in these organizations. Methodological Contributions: This study fills a gap in the credit union literature because there are few studies of discretionary actions in these organizations such as accounting choices, earnings management, fraud, or errors. Our findings may also indicate adjustments made by credit unions to comply with the sector standard due to the adoption of Resolutions No. 4,434 and No. 4,454. Benford's Law is useful as a tool in selecting audit samples, and it can also improve the work of supervisory bodies.",,,CREDIT UNION; SOCIAL STRUCTURE; TRANSITIONAL ECONOMIES; ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; ORGANIZATION FOUNDING

The analysis shows that villages characterized by ascribed power and inherited hierarchy (chief villages) provide less structural support for the founding and operation of credit unions and are less likely to adopt credit unions than communities whose leadership is determined by individual merits and achievement (big man villages). This finding suggests that existing authority structures in these traditional societies constrain incentive schemes and trust structures critical to the founding and persistence of new economic organizations.",,10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00734-0,Credit union; Cooperative banking; Moral hazard; Risk management

This paper analyzes how differences in incentive structure constrain the attractiveness of interest-rate speculation and other risk-taking opportunities to managers and regulators of credit unions. Despite these better incentives, robust present-value calculations establish that NCUSIF fell into economic insolvency during the mid-1980s. Besides calculating the extent of this insolvency, the paper also seeks to explain why, after NCUSIF became insolvent, it could rebuild its reserves without an explicit or implicit taxpayer bailout. Our explanation turns on cross-industry coinsurance responsibilities and the shallowness of the fund's observed insolvency relative to industry net worth. We identify forces in the decisionmaking environment tending to limit the depth and duration of unresolved insolvencies at individual credit unions. Managerial opportunities to benefit personally from taking risks that would flow through to NCUSIF are constrained by difficulties in converting a credit union to stockholder form and by the intensity of proactive monitoring of troubled credit unions by sister institutions and other private coinsurers.

Unbalanced pool regressions analyze growth rates during the pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery periods, controlling for size, net charge-offs, and unemployment. Findings Univariate test results that control for size show that banks grow at faster rates than credit unions for most of the pre-crisis years. However, medium sized credit unions grow at faster rates for most of the crisis and recovery years. Results of unbalanced pool regressions suggest that, overall, credit unions grow at slower rates than do banks.

First, it analyses the income structure in cooperative financial institutions and examines how traditional and non-traditional incomes are related. Second, it evaluates whether increasing diversification towards non-traditional incomes facilitates or hampers the benefits of financial cooperative owners. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from over 3,100 US credit unions over the period of 1994-2016. A number of modern econometric techniques are employed throughout the analysis, including the use of panel fixed effect, generalised method of moments (GMM) and two-stage least square (2SLS) methodologies. Findings Using US credit unions as the empirical setting, the empirical results reveal that the expansion of traditional income leads to a corresponding increase in income from non-traditional activities. However, an increasing reliance on non-traditional income causes a significant drop in interest margins. The authors also find that the extent to which income diversification affects owner benefit varies across credit union types and period of time. While income diversification negatively affects owners' benefits in single common bond credit unions, it has no significant influence on multiple common bond and community credit union owners' benefits. Third, diversification can be beneficial during crisis time, but can be detrimental to owner benefit during normal time. Originality/value This paper provides some of the first empirical investigations on the diversification strategy of cooperative financial institutions. Therefore, the results offer significant policy implications for policymakers and market participants on whether financial cooperatives should diversify or specialise.",,10.18028/rgfc.v10i2.9534,Credit Risk; Credit Rating; Credit Unions; PEARLS Model

Nonetheless, the benefit from lower auto loan rates is likely an underestimate of the true value to consumers of credit unions' presence in the market.",,10.1016/j.irfa.2018.01.009,Capital regulation; Credit union capital; Loans to members; Business cycle fluctuations; Countercyclical capital buffer; Conservation capital buffer; Basel III

However, changes in these two types of buffers are negatively related to changes in the loans to assets ratios. This finding suggests that to adjust their capital buffers, Canadian credit unions curtail their loans and underscores the importance of the Basel III conservation and the countercyclical buffer requirements in fostering credit. Further, we show that the risk-based capital buffer is positively related to the credit cycle.

The objective of this study was to analyze the agribusiness practices adopted by cooperatives and associations of farmers in Para state (Eastern Amazon, Brazil) and the importance they attribute to environmental conservation. The methodology consisted of remotely conducting interviews based on a questionnaire with farmer cooperatives and associations. We found that the main products produced by the cooperatives and associations were fruits and their derivatives. In addition, we identified a significant positive relationship between the operation duration of a cooperative or association and the number of products they produced. Regarding the challenges faced by cooperatives, legal challenges were most notable, while the challenges faced by associations were related to environmental issues. Notably, associa-tions and cooperatives showed low agreement considering the importance of each conservation practices analyzed. The results also suggested that the current subsidies granted to cooperatives and associations have nonsignificant impacts on the intensity of their adoption of environmental conservation practices, implying that monetary incentives are effective only with cooperatives/associations that have weaker attitudes toward the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.

Advisory organisations with incorporated research and development (R&D) can translate findings from both their own research projects and external sources, which increases their absorptive capacity and boosts service innovation. Further, systematic emphasis on continuous learning strengthens AC, as do networking and internal communications. Practical implications: By improving the incorporation of R&D, continuous learning and networking, advisory service organisations can benefit from the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS). Ultimately farmers can receive more updated and relevant services for their farms.

In this study, we investigate two research questions. First, we compare risk-taking by banks and credit unions, with an additional consideration as to how regulatory oversight (state or federal) relates to such risk-taking. Second, we examine how competition affects the difference in risk-taking between these two types of financial institutions. To answer both questions, we rely on a matched sample (by loan type, size, and county) of commercial banks and credit unions, covering the period between 2010 and 2017. We use three empirical proxies for risk-taking, the Z-score, measuring an institution's insolvency risk, as well as the ratios of non-performing loans to total loans and loan charge-offs to total loans, measuring the credit risk. Our results suggest that banks tend to engage in more risk-taking than credit unions; however, state regulatory oversight reduces the risk-taking gap, especially in terms of the Z-score. We further find that competition induces different risktaking behaviors in banks and credit unions.

We still have very limited knowledge of why the country's agricultural producers (especially smallholder farmers) are reluctant to cooperate in Lithuania. The aim of this study is to assess the level of the willingness to cooperate among smallholder farmers in Lithuania and to draw up the profiles of small-scale farms that participate in and intend to join cooperatives and, conversely, that do not participate in cooperatives and do not intend to do so. To achieve this goal, a representative survey of small-scale farms was conducted. Results of surveys carried out in 2019 in Lithuania on a group of 1002 small-scale farms showed that only 8% of the surveyed farms participate in producer groups or cooperatives, while another 8% intend to participate. Small-scale farms in Lithuania have weak market integration, with no bargaining power on input and output markets. The vast majority of small-scale farms are reluctant to participate in cooperative activities in Lithuania.

Then, we explored the relationship between them. The conclusions are: (1) Jinchang City has the lowest pressure on infrastructure and the largest pressure on industrial development, with significant spatial differences in comprehensive pressure. (2) Jinchang City is dominated by double pressure villages (40.60%) and comprehensive pressure villages (38.35%). Single-pressure villages (19.55%) and non-pressure villages (1.50%) account for relatively small proportions.

Because they, cannot issue equity, and other income increasing options conflicted with credit union philosophy, this provided a strong incentive to use MCE as an option to rapidly increase revenue (and capital). We find MCE was financially ineffective in small credit unions, had a positive marketing leverage impact in large credit unions, and required regular renewal.

Welfare-friendly claims hold considerable ambiguity in meaning since there is no precise definition of what better 'animal welfare' means in practice. However, despite this ambiguity there are numbers of animals that are being made into food products which carry labelling that suggests higher animal welfare, and in addition many animals or parts of animals which experience the same living standards but which don't ever get labelled to suggest welfare-friendliness. Through the development of an 'economy of qualities' (Callon et al. 2002) within the food market there have been a number of private initiatives by major retailers, farmers' cooperatives, independent standard bodies, manufacturing brands within the UK which has supported the development of a market for 'welfare-friendly' food products. How do these organisations work together to realise the economic potential through product labelling or corporate branding of meat/dairy or egg products from welfare-friendly production practices?

We focus on a system centered on three reservoirs that capture the waters of the Upper Comoe River Basin and servicing a diversity of users, including a sugar manufacturing company, a urban water supply utility, a farmer cooperative, and other downstream users. Due to variable and declining rainfall and expanding users' needs, drastic fluctuations in water supply and demand occur during each dry season. A decision support tool was developed through participatory research to enable users to assess the impact of alternative release and diversion schedules on deficits faced by each user. The tool is meant to be applied in the context of consultative planning by a local user committee that has been created by a new national integrated water management policy. We contend that both solid science and good governance are instrumental in realizing efficient and equitable water management and adaptation to climate variability and change.

The authors assess the conditions under which IST could improve the well-being of the associated farmers and, at the same time, improve financial sustainability. Financial aspects are of particular relevance since the characteristics of the cooperative cause the management of the tool to become potentially risky. Design/methodology/approach The analysis relies on a balanced panel dataset to report the production and economic characteristics of individual associated farms. This is the basis for simulating the implementation of the IST as described in the current European regulation. The expected utility approach is then used to assess the potential impact on farmers' well-being under different levels of risk aversion and premiums. The analysis of the IST annual cash flow allows for an accurate assessment of its financial sustainability. Findings The results suggest that the IST can improve farmers' well-being under plausible levels of risk aversion and premiums, making most farmers willing to support its implementation. Furthermore, the tool could be financially sustainable even if implemented in a specialized and geographically concentrated group of farms. In addition, the results suggest that the use of strategies such as the IST could help cope with negative annual balances by treating the financial sustainability of the fund. Originality/value The analysis adds to previous research on the IST by accounting for farmers' risk aversion. Furthermore, it is the first analysis that simulates the implementation of this tool in a sector-specific and concentrated group of farms.

Drawing on a history of the U.S. Farm Bill, this paper argues that a fixation on farm subsidies ignores why they came into being, and more generally glosses over the imperative for modern states to intervene into agricultural economies. Karl Polanyi's 'double movement' framework is used to situate the rise and fall of agricultural supply management within food regime theory. In the second, or surplus food regime, the U.S. government wielded excess commodities as geopolitical tools even as domestic farm policy labored to contain overproduction, and thus support agrarian viability. In the subsequent corporate food regime, free market agriculture displaces and discredits supply management, even as massive government intervention into how food is grown and sold continues. Making space to remember historical price support programs, to situate their accomplishments and limitations, and to recognize residual supply -management mechanisms (such as farm cooperatives and agricultural marketing orders) is crucial for fostering agricultural viability in the US and beyond. Twentieth century supply management had flaws, but it cannot be wholly omitted. This paper highlights key motivations, elements, and contradictions of these policies and programs to begin the process of considering how supply management principles and strategies could be updated and enhanced for 21st century agriculture. Such a framework would need to pay more attention to diversity within domestic and international agricultures, and be more sensitive to the multi-scalar dimensions of food systems.

However, the recent crisis has complicated the activity and margins of financial entities in Spain, which has derived in a deep credit crunch in the Spanish economy. In the middle of the dramatic restructuring and recapitalization process implemented by Spanish commercial banks, credit unions have strengthened their solvency and increased their market share during the crisis period. Despite this evidence, in general, credit unions have been considered less efficient than commercial banks because they have a dual nature: on the one hand, these companies are cooperatives so they are Social Economy enterprises, and, on the other hand, they are entities in the banking system. However, few studies have focused on empirically evaluating their efficiency, and even less in a crisis context. This study aims to estimate the financial efficiency in the banking activity of Spanish credit unions during the period 2008-2013 and to analyse their determinants. To achieve these objectives, an innovative two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is applied under the condition of national and sectorial homogeneity. Our results suggest that credit unions in Spain were quite inefficient in their banking activity during the crisis period, although they were able to improve the management of their inputs to obtain their financial outputs year after year. The findings also show that both the agglomeration in urban areas and the regional effect have influenced significantly on their financial efficiency.",,10.1080/24694452.2019.1685368,

In contrast to banks that generate profit for outside investors and do not give voice to customers, these not-for-profit institutions have a democratic governance structure and a mission to provide good services to their members. We use diverse economies and critical/feminist geographic information system (GIS) approaches to theorize them as noncapitalist alternatives to banks and possible sites of social transformation toward a solidarity economy. Using the case of cooperative finance in New York City, we analyze spatial patterns, characteristics, and placemaking practices of credit unions with different kinds of the common bond, a principle that unites a financial community, and in relation to urban geographies of class and race. We find that credit unions provide a historically proven mechanism for collective resistance to marginalization by racial capitalism and, depending on the common bond type, make place by (1) providing financial inclusion in poor and minority neighborhoods; (2) scaling up solidarity finance through participation of middle classes; and (3) diverting assets from capitalist investment into social reproduction and livelihoods. Credit unions express the racialized wealth of their communities, however, and create spatial exclusions that pose a challenge to postcapitalist movements such as solidarity economy. These findings are applicable to other places marked by segregation and call for further inquiry into possibilities and barriers to solidarity finance.

We argue that channel diversity is positively associated with a firm's profitability and negatively associated with its profit volatility, and that channel diversity and product diversity are complementary in driving these profit-enhancing and volatility-suppressing effects. We test our hypotheses in the U.S. credit union industry, in which credit unions offer a variety of loan and deposit products through a variety of online and offline channels, including physical branches, ATMs, telephone banking, online banking, and mobile banking. By analyzing a longitudinal dataset of 7577 credit unions in 2009-2016, the study provides empirical evidence that operating a full spectrum of online and offline channels leads to higher profitability and lower profit volatility for credit unions. The study also reveals differential moderating effects of loan product diversity and deposit product diversity, in that loan product diversity enhances the profit-enhancing effect of channel diversity while deposit product diversity enhances the volatility-suppressing effect of channel diversity.

In this paper, we introduce REALISTIC, a novel event-based modeling framework for supply chain networks (SCNs) that includes production processes. It extends McCarty's Resources-Events-Agents (REA) accounting model with secure transformations, which, across the entire SCN, guarantee that certified output resources cannot be digitally produced ex nihilo, but require certified input resources of at least the same amount as what is produced. This generalizes the no-double-spend guarantee of current BC/DLT to (digital twins of) physical resources and their production. Authenticated human or robotic Internet of Things (IoT) actors digitally sign and cryptographically commit to the veracity of real-world events on an immutable database, without having to take responsibility for their aggregate consequences. User-specifiable interpretations, corresponding to queries and analytical functions in database systems, provide auditable aggregate information computed from recorded events across the entire SCN. This includes fine-grained and trustworthy tracing of final products through multiple stages of production processes, semi-finished products, quality certifications and transportation all the way back to their raw materials. We present a case study for an end-to-end coffee supply chain that tracks fine-grained and detailed information from a farmer's coffee cherries to retail coffee bags, involving all its actors. Our model handles product provenance; auditable sustainability, quality and trade information; production processes from parchment via green to roasted coffee; product quality tests; farmer certifications; and transportation across the entire coffee supply chain. It is based on field work involving farmers, cooperatives, processors, traders, importers, and a major roasting company stretching from Colombia to Scandinavia.

Commercial banks claim that credit unions are no different than banks and that the credit union tax exemption represents an unfair competitive advantage. Credit unions counter that while they offer similar products and services, they differ from commercial banks in terms of structure and mission, given their not-for-profit, cooperative status. In this paper, we test for substantive differences in the objective functions of commercial banks and nonprofit credit unions by comparing CEO compensation structures. Drawing on the relevant principal-agent literature, we provide several arguments to support the hypotheses that credit union boards of directors establish lower-powered incentive contracts with their CEOs relative to similarly sized commercial banks, and offer lower total compensation. We find that credit union CEOs receive approximately 250% less performance-based compensation relative to CEOs of similarly sized community banks. Bank CEOs also earn approximately 15% to 20% more total compensation on average. The results are generally robust to controlling for CEO- and board-level characteristics, local economic conditions, and institution-level indicators of size, growth, complexity, liquidity and risk.

However, uncertainty persists in understanding the balance between individual and collective priority, how members inter-relate and negotiate these different motivations over time, and how this connects to different forms of outcome. This paper evaluates the experiences of the Pontbren farmer co-operative in Mid-Wales (UK) to explore these issues, as an exemplar of the multiple and sometimes unexpected outcomes of co-operative activity. Here-in day-to-day practices and emotional affects are highlighted as critical elements of co-operation alongside the skills and know-how required to sustain working relations. In addition, the farmers' changing sense of self is considered to evaluate the extent to which co-operation can bring about new forms of identification. The approach outlined aims to augment existing Bourdieu-inspired readings of social learning and capital exchange with insights from the literature on social practice and diverse economies (following the work of Elizabeth Shove, J.K. Gibson-Graham and colleagues). Overall, findings demonstrate a need to frame co-operation as an emergent process which can move the individuals involved beyond preformed judgements and measures of social positioning, altering their conceptions of how to relate to others. Moreover, it is argued that the value of this relatedness needs to be understood in more expansive terms, and not only as calculable forms of 'capital'. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study include: (i) to assess the management and sustainability of irrigation projects, (ii) to find out the impact of the irrigation projects on rural communities' development, (iii) to find out the challenges that hinders farmers from effectively using irrigation water from the perspective of farmers and to find the possible solutions to the challenges. 38 and 40% of respondents from Golinga and Botanga irrigation schemes respectively agreed that cropping areas have moderately expanded due to the presence of irrigation scheme however, 52 and 39% of respondents from both schemes respectively indicated that the presence of the irrigation scheme to them has little impact in helping farmers expand their cropping areas. There was also moderate increase in crop yields in both communities due to the constant water supply to farmers obtained from irrigation projects. The study shows that the major challenge that hinders farmers from using irrigation water is the high cost of renting irrigable land for farming in the irrigation schemes indicated by a response of 47 and 64% amongst farmers in Botanga and Golinga irrigation schemes respectively. The study suggests that the need for relevant stakeholders to; revise the cost of renting irrigable lands, acquire and adopt the use of simple and affordable technologies (machines), implement reforms and policies to reduce land consolidation and fragmentation, organize and mobilize farmers in farmer cooperatives to promote collective marketing and organize capacity building sessions for farmers regarding the project sustainability.",,10.18820/24150487/as29i2.3,

The best DEA model provides results comparable to the equity/asset ratio when a slack adjusted efficiency score is used to measure efficiency, particularly for Credit Unions with larger asset sizes.

Assessing from different channels is central for exploiting the potential to increase production, farm income and investment. However there are restrictions in channel choices because of poor infrastructure, lack of marketing facilities, insufficient credit and up to date market information. Moreover, due to the oligopsony market structure and without organization, individual marketing practices exposes them to high transaction costs with low bargaining position.

The main objective is to compare sources of knowledge through the content analysis of the service operations strategy as proposed by the literature and validated by specialists. Design/methodology/approach This research is a qualitative study that uses the knowledge of specialists to frame a performance assessment structure applied to credit unions. The research strategy is based on multicriteria analysis, and the selected techniques are based on the MCDA-C procedure, that is, the processes of structuring, evaluating and recommending improvements. Findings The research results provided: a data set external to the context that serves as theoretical support for the comparisons made; the structuring of 4 unique organisational performance assessment models carried out through the MCDA-C procedure; conceptual interpretation using the lens of the operations strategy in the cognitive maps of the assessment models, which identifies the operations strategy carried out; and comparison of the result models that show their uniqueness. Originality/value The comparison between the origins of knowledge is highlighted, and the demonstration of the content was proposed by the literature and by specialists to evaluate the performance in operations. This was then compared with the content constructed with credit union managers in structuring models based on the singularities of the respective contexts.

This article explains the sociohistorical and theoretical implications of YDP-UIM under the supervision of the Presbyterian Church of Korea into the following three aspects. First, many democratic labor unions supported or led by YDP-UIM played a significant role historically in establishing the Korean Federation of Trade Unions. Second, credit unions introduced to the GIC by YDP-UIM saw unexpected success in protecting GIC industrial workers from falling prey to institutionalized usurers, and the National Credit Union Federation of Korea has grown today to become the world's third largest credit union federation. In-depth interviews with YDP-UIM's leading activists, however, repeatedly reveal that their practical innovation was the result of their self-reflective interaction with industrial workers alienated from religion itself as well from established society. Finally, these interviews point out how and why the positive relationship between religious innovation and free competition posited by religious market theorists should be revised, both theoretically and empirically, in the Korean context.",,,financial system; financially inactive population; money source; solidarity; common interest; credit union

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the affect theory of social exchange, a theoretical model was developed and empirically tested using a survey of 691 employees from 15 North American credit unions. Findings - The negotiated mode of knowledge exchange, i.e. when a knowledge contributor explicitly establishes reciprocation conditions with a recipient, develops negative knowledge sharing attitude. The reciprocal mode, i.e. when a knowledge donor assumes that a receiver will reciprocate, has no effect on knowledge sharing attitude. The generalized exchange form, i.e. when a knowledge contributor believes that other organizational members may reciprocate, is weakly related to knowledge sharing attitude. The productive exchange mode, i.e. when a knowledge provider assumes he or she is a responsible citizen within a cooperative enterprise, strongly facilitates the development of knowledge sharing attitude, which, in turn, leads to knowledge sharing intentions. Practical implications - To facilitate inter-employee knowledge sharing, managers should focus on the development of positive knowledge sharing culture when all employees believe they contribute to a common good instead of expecting reciprocal benefits.

Modern experience in streamlining social and economic relations between stakeholders focuses on the development of functional institutions that can act as agents of change. Forms of organization of such institutions can be clusters, technology parks, holdings, management companies, joint-stock companies, state-owned companies, manufacturers' associations, marketing cooperatives, and professional communities. Research methods are statistics index analysis and network analysis. Working with these research methods, World Bank Input-Output Database, Federal Custom data, Rosstat data and law searching system we prove impossibility of full-fledged cluster policy implementation.

The superficial reason for such bad financial services in rural areas lies in the idea that people with little money are not suitable enough clients for financial institutions. Social discrepancies between urban and rural areas have been officially stated to exist in Latvia according to the report about social inclusion of the European Commission. Microfinance is seen as a widely accepted tool to combat these discrepancies. Nevertheless the vocabulary of microfinance can be understood only by professionals, even if it is intended for the masses. The sector is very fragmented, and there is not even a proper definition of the term yet. Activities in the Microfinance sector identified in Latvia can be assigned to the following models: credit unions; downscaling of commercial bank activities; and NGO based programmes and projects. Recommendations to improve the Microfinance sector in Latvia and especially to combine the existing trends of commercial banks to downsize their activities with supportive measures are: target subsidies toward institution building. providing incentives to encourage greater focus and innovation in the development of financial services for the poor; increasing cooperation and partnership, both among all types of microfinance providers and between them and mainstream banks, to increase financial service provision to the poor; improving the legal and regulatory environment for microfinance and for credit unions specifically Within all these discussions it is very important to emphasize that the access to advice, education and training is regarded as equally relevant as the access to finance.

Numerous studies have highlighted the role of intellectual capital as a key driver of organisational performance due to its importance as an asset in the value creation process, yet few have analysed the relationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction. Considering the relevance of knowledge management and intellectual capital in the service sector, namely in the banking system (Curado 2008; Starbuck 2002), this study aims to assess the structure of intellectual capital in a Brazilian Credit Union, and how it relates to internal communication and job satisfaction. To accomplish this objective, a structural model, based on Longo and Mura (2011), was developed and tested on a sample of 109 employees from a particular branch of the union. Results confirm the three-dimensionality of the Intellectual Capital construct and that job satisfaction, as well as internal communication, are constructs separate from intellectual capital and should not be confused. In fact, internal communication may be considered as an antecedent of intellectual capital, whereas job satisfaction is a consequence. Furthermore, results suggest that intellectual capital plays a mediation role in the relationship between internal communication and job satisfaction. Nevertheless, the framework presented in this paper is not without limitations. Firstly, the sample size and the fact that it is a case study requires caution regarding extrapolation of conclusions. A second limitation has to do with the measurement of Relational Capital, as items employed have shown to be problematic in terms of convergent validity. Nevertheless, this study holds great potential for the strategic management of human resources in banking, in particular credit unions, which is a prime concern for bank administrations, bank branch collaborators, and society at large. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model the interrelationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction in a credit union, an organisation with particular structural and strategic features resulting from its external customers being members and owners.",,10.1016/j.jbankfin.2012.03.018,Microfinance; Efficiency; Technology; Stochastic frontier; Ownership type; Latin America

Cocoa (Theobroma cacao Linn.) production remains one of the main cash crops in Cameroon with over 90% of households in the cocoa producing areas depending on it for their income. Cameroon ranks fifth in the world in cocoa production which has a significant contribution to her economy. This important sector is exposed to climate-related shocks requiring mitigation and adaptation strategies. From an economic perspective, climate-insurance has been suggested as one of the solutions to this problem, as an option to reduce farmers' vulnerability. However, there is little or no information on farmers' preparedness and willingness to pay for climate -related insurance. This article therefore seeks to ascertain the level of preparedness of farmers to sue for climate insurance in cocoa producing areas in Cameroon. We randomly selected 10 cocoa farmer cooperatives drawn across the main cocoa producing divisions of the South West Region - a major cocoa producing region in Cameroon. We combine a structured questionnaire survey with focus group discussions to assess cocoa farmers' awareness, knowledge, perception, level of preparedness and challenges to adopting climate insurance. Furthermore, we interview insurance authorities within the region on existing insurance policies. This information is complemented through field observations and review of relevant literature. We employ descriptive and correlation analysis to assess cocoa farmers' perceptions and level of preparedness for climate insurance. We observe that there is a direct statistically significant relationship between farm sizes, level of diversification and awareness, and farmers' preparedness (P <= 0.05). Income levels showed a significant but indirect relationship with level of preparedness. Poverty, uncertainty, and weak institutions operating with policies that do not consider farmers' realities were key challenges to climate-insurance preparedness. Based on the results we recommend that (i) insurance bodies should undertake feasibility study on the possibilities of instituting friendlier policy for farmers, (ii) farmers should sensitized on the relevance of insurance policies to support cocoa farming in the face of climate vagaries, (iii) farmer groups should strengthen cooperative spirit to ease access to pro-poor insurance policies; and (iv) government should work in partnership with insurance bodies to support farmers through more climate-friendly insurance policies which can be accessed by farmers irrespective of their levels of diversification, income and farm sizes.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors influencing the agri-food cooperatives' trade credit operations by measuring their accounts receivable and comparing the results with agri-food investor-owned firms (IOFs). Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply a partial adjustment model (PAM) estimated using a dynamic panel model with a two-step general method of moments (GMM) estimator to a sample of 11,930 Spanish agri-food cooperatives and IOFs for the period 2011-2018. Findings - The study concludes that cooperatives and IOFs have an accounts receivable target, which they attempt to achieve rapidly. Cooperatives tend to behave as IOFs do, but they present lower adjustment coefficients. This difference seems to be explained by the unique characteristics of cooperatives which set different economic and social goals, not just profit maximization as IOFs. The findings show differences between the financial and commercial purposes of the cooperatives and IOFs as a result of their internal management policies. Larger cooperatives with access to external financial sources, positive cash flows and operational necessities will grant trade credit.

This structure enables the manufacturers to reach multiple segments of consumers with different online and offline shopping preferences, but it may create channel conflicts due to the manufacturers' competitive position in the end market. Cooperative advertising programs can be implemented in response to the emerging competitive dynamics between the manufacturers and the retailers. We investigate the impact of the consumers' sales channel preference (i.e., consumer loyalty) and the product compatibility with online shopping (i.e., product web compatibility or web fit) on the cooperative advertising and pricing decisions of a manufacturer and a retailer in a dual-channel supply chain. We use game-theoretical models and characterize the firms' equilibrium behaviors under different power structures in the channel. Our results indicate that the level of the retailer's advertising investment and the manufacturer's reimbursement in the cooperative advertising program depend critically on consumer loyalty, product web compatibility, and the power distribution among the channel members. For example, when the channel power is symmetrically distributed or held asymmetrically by the retailer, the retailer's local advertising level increases as the product web compatibility decreases or the proportion of store-loyal consumers increases; whereas this trend is reversed when the manufacturer is the channel leader. We examine how the introduction of the direct channel affects the profits, and we generate additional managerial insights from numerical experiments.",,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.04.036,Hybrid; Coordination; Network contract; Remoteness; Social capital

To explain the participation in this form of arrangements, the bulk of the literature has focused on firm-level characteristics. In this paper, we assess the role that the territorial dimension, in terms of social capital and geographical remoteness, plays in the explaining Italian firms' participation to Network Contracts (NC). NC have been institutionalized in Italy in 2009 to provide a legal framework for the formation of a wide range of hybrids, encompassing both vertical and horizontal coordination. Data on the population of NCs are aggregated at the municipality level and analyzed through a zero-hurdle model, that properly addresses skewed data with many zeros and admits different underlying processes to explain the zero values. Results show that the territorial dimension plays a major role in explaining the participation to NCs. Proxied through a synthetic indicator, the social capital is strongly significant and negatively related to the number of NC members at the municipality level. However, such a relation proves to be more complicated when different dimensions of social capital are taken into account and when trying to disentangle its effect on horizontal and vertical NC. With respect to geography, remoteness seems to hinder the formation of NCs, as the more peripheral a given municipality, the lower the number of participants. NCs seems to be a legal framework that is able to overcome the constraint to coordination set by the lack of social capital, but it does not show to overcome the problem related to remoteness.",,10.1108/IJOA-01-2022-3115,Multilingual employees; Task switching; Bilingual employees; Adjustment to change; Organizational change management; Organizational analysis; Change management; Language; HRM; Organizational change; Employee productivity

This study aims to explore the effect of multilingualism on employee ability to adjust to workplace changes based on the concept that multilinguals have been found to switch between tasks more efficiently as compared to monolinguals. Design/methodology/approach Applying a sequential explanatory mixed methods research approach, quantitative performance evaluation data on 207 credit union employees is analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling to predict employee performance, and thematic analysis of qualitative data representing the adjustment narratives of six monolingual and six multilingual employees within the sample is conducted, corresponding to the period during which employees were adjusting to broad workplace changes after the onset of the global pandemic. Findings The results suggest greater predicted improvement in the performance of multilingual employees. Reliance on the task-switching ability associated with multilingualism is found to be the primary self-evaluative factor for successful change adjustment among multilingual employees. Practical implications In light of work performance benefits identified in this study, organizations may consider multilingualism as a characteristic preceding better adjustment to organizational change, and not simply as a skill applicable to tasks requiring language proficiency, suggesting practical implications for human resource and organizational management. Originality/value This is the first sequential explanatory study focusing on the task-switching ability of multilinguals as an antecedent to change adjustment evidenced by improved work performance within an organizational context.",,10.1016/j.apmrv.2018.08.001,Deposit mobilization; Financial sustainability; Operational efficiency; Outreach; SACCO

The main objective of this study is to examine the sustainability and outreach performance of SACCOs in Eastern Ethiopia. The study employed both descriptive and causal research design. 46 SACCOs that have been operating at least for three years with audited financial reports were selected for the study. The study used secondary data sources mainly audited financial statement of the society for the year 2016. The study found that SACCOs in Eastern Ethiopia are financially sustainable and their outreach performance is at moderate level. Return on asset, operational efficiency, debt equity ratio, donation, and deposit mobilization are statistically significant predictor variables in determining the financial self-sufficiency of SACCOs. Similarly, financial self-sufficiency, size, debt equity ratio and donation are statistically significant predictor variables in determining the outreach performance of SACCOs.

We argue that, in their enthusiasm for facilitating IS innovation, the leadership of the movement neglected more deep-seated organisational issues that were, to that point, largely unarticulated. In an attempt to get to the heart of these issues, we synthesise a distinctive theoretical perspective that draws mainly on institutional theory. This helps untangle the complex institutional heritage of the credit union movement, which resulted in the emergence of an interesting hybridity of institutional logics and latent contradictions. These contradictions provoked the emergence of a particular kind of institutional entrepreneurship, which was deeply implicated in reshaping institutionalised ways of thinking and doing. We emphasise the political nature of the change process and argue that the institutional arrangements for governing the ISIS project, which also underpinned the governance of the broader movement, were not well suited to manage the risk associated with such an enterprise. We conclude by suggesting that the case described might be an example of the workings of a broader kind of change dynamics around ICT. Specifically, the scale and scope of the change project acted as a trigger that brought tensions underlying existing competing institutional logics to a head, thus provoking institutional reform.",,10.5585/remark.v19i4.16122,Internal Marketing; Internal communication; Leadership; Information systems; Credit cooperative

Because of incomplete contracts and relationship-specific investments, client organisations may face switching costs, which in some cases may be large enough to render vendor switching an unattractive option. Based on an extensive review of the literature, we develop hypotheses about relationship-, firm-, and market-specific determinants of switching costs. We then develop an econometric model to identify those determinants and their relative importance and estimate the magnitude of switching costs. In the empirical study, we observe accounting data of 1318 US credit unions (CUs) and follow their IT outsourcing choices over 11 years. We find that the largest portion of switching costs is due to relationship- and firm-specific factors, while market-specific variables are much less important. Our estimates suggest that average switching costs account for one-third of the average annual expenditure for professional services. We further highlight that the average hides substantial heterogeneity. Switching costs of CUs that decide to switch vendors are about 50% lower than those of CUs that stay. Looking more closely at stayers, our most conservative estimate of the lock-in effect, i.e., the difference in switching costs of deliberate and non-deliberate stayers, is equivalent to about 70% of the average annual expenditure for professional services.",,10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104962,Forest commons; Vertical integration; Transaction cost; Treatment effects; Precautionary saving

For the most part, many users of forest commons extract forest products, typically non-timber products, for subsistence use or safety net purposes. To overcome this problem, in recent years, collective vertical integration (VI) of forest product marketing cooperative structures have been promoted and, in some cases, adopted by users of forest commons. Although this type of program has been observed to raise smallholder incomes, there is little evidence available on saving/investment responses to such income gains. This paper investigates precautionary saving and investment responses to collective forest product marketing programs among users of forest commons in Ethiopian villages. To identify the causal effects of the program, I applied propensity score matching, difference-in-difference (DID) and change-in-change (CIC) estimators to household survey data collected from randomly selected households in the Gimbo district (south-western Ethiopia). I find strong evidence that participation in the program reduces savings in the form of livestock holdings and that effect is limited to non-poor households. When interpreted in terms of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), the results imply that participants felt the current income gains to be non-transient, which led to reduced precautionary savings and to a gain in consumption/welfare. Moreover, I found that the program has spurred investment in child education and participation in off-farm self-employment. These results point to the importance of the safety net/insurance channel of the program. Overall, the findings underscore the program's potential to raise the standard of living via ancillary mechanisms beyond directly raising income outcome. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines the role of the DCSs in improving the socio-economic status of weaker sections, including women and lower-caste people (Bihar, India). We find that social inclusion has been a regular practice at the DCS level, promoting a diversified social relationship among rural women.

The data were collected from randomly selected 200 farmers from four blocks of Ludhiana and Patiala districts where paddy is a major kharif crop which requires adequate doses of urea for its growth. The results of the study revealed that the consumption/sale of urea in Punjab during the year 2007-08 was 2646.44 th. MT which rose to 3086.05 th. MT during the period 2007-08 to 2015-16 at an annual growth rate of 1.64 percent.

The analysis of the primary data revealed that the majority of the respondent farmers purchased NCU and Normal urea (NU) from co-operative societies followed by private fertilizer dealers while the cost per bag of NCU, including transportation cost, worked out to be '289.69 while it was '276.58 per bag in case of NU. There was marginal increase in the productivity of paddy crop during the year 2015-16 as compared to the year 2014-15. The net returns per acre were estimated to be '31401 during the year 2015-16 and '29530 in 2014-15. As far as awareness about NCU was concerned, almost all the selected farmers were aware about the NCU and major source of awareness was co-operative societies. There was a significant increase in the application of NCU after 2015-16 in crops such as; paddy, wheat, basmati, sugarcane, potato, maize, sunflower, and vegetables. Due to the application of NCU, only 5.29 percent farmers reported about the increase in paddy yield while the cost of pest and disease control declined by 21 percent. There was increase in productivity of paddy crop where neem coated urea (NCU) was applied on the sample farms. Also, the NCU usage on the sample farms increased while cost of pest and disease control measures declined. The partial budgeting technique brought out that there were added returns of '718 per acre by application of NCU on the sample farms. It was also revealed by all the respondents that there was no change in the texture of the soil, soil moisture retention capacity, water infiltration rate, soil softness and decline in the compaction of the soil due to application of NCU but there was higher retention of nitrate in the soil and thereby its slow release to the crop. Also, the NCU usage on the sample farms increased while cost of pest and disease control measures declined. High price of NCU, inadequate/shortage of supply during peak season and poor quality of NCU in some of the co-operative societies were the major problems reported by the respondents. Major suggestions were; assured/timely and adequate supply of NCU to co-operative societies and organizing training camps for spreading awareness.

In order to scrutinise this assumption, this article proposes a set of concepts to study the dynamics of transformative social innovation and underlying processes of multi-actor (dis)empowerment. First, the concept of transformative social innovation is unpacked by proposing four foundational concepts to help distinguish between different pertinent 'shades' of change and innovation: 1) social innovation, (2) system innovation, (3) game-changers, and (4) narratives of change. These concepts, invoking insights from transitions studies and social innovations literature, are used to construct a conceptual account of how trans formative social innovation emerges as a co-evolutionary interaction between diverse shades of change and innovation. Second, the paper critically discusses the dialectic nature of multi-actor (dis)empowerment that underlies such processes of change and innovation. The paper then demonstrates how the conceptualisations are applied to three empirical case-studies of transformative social innovation: Impact Hub, Time Banks and Credit Unions. In the conclusion we synthesise how the concepts and the empirical examples help to understand contemporary shifts in societal power relations and the changing role of the welfare state.",,10.1080/10253860903346765,Rochdale co-operatives; rural; community; retailing; consumer

This paper focuses on three Rochdale rural consumer co-operatives in this region. While the paper argues that marketing the co-operatives in terms of their community links and democratic structure was important to their success over many years, it was not sufficient to ensure survival. Co-operatives found it necessary to highlight their competitive prices and the quality of their goods. They were vulnerable to changes in the rural economy that led to a decline in the local population. Their survival also depended on the quality of their management, with poor investment decisions and recruitment practices undermining profitability. Generous credit policies also undermined the co-operatives financially. By comparing the three co-operatives and their communities, this paper aims to develop a more sophisticated approach to explaining the survival and demise of Rochdale consumer co-operatives in rural Australia.",,10.1016/j.iimb.2021.03.008,Dignity; Meaningful work; Knowledge; Cooperation; Engagement

A crucial differentiator between the beef sector and the dairy sector, which has higher farm incomes, is well-developed infrastructure of farmer-owned dairy processing and marketing co-operatives. To address the lack of representative farmer organisations and power imbalances in the beef supply chain, in 2016 the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM) legislated for the establishment of beef Producer Organisations (POs), facilitating beef producers to collectively strengthen their market positioning. While PO legislation is a significant development in potentially enabling supply chain integration of farmers, how the legislation is operationalised by Irish beef industry stakeholders will ultimately shape the nature and breadth of engagement with the PO model and, consequently, the impact of the legislation. In a context where there is little or no prior experience of such organisations in the beef sector, this paper presents an analysis of current stakeholder views in relation to the establishment of POs. Research involved a desk based review of the submissions made during the consultation period for the beef PO legislation and interviews with key informants in the Irish beef industry. We analysed Irish stakeholders' views through the lens of lessons learned from the existing literature on how POs operate internationally. Results indicate some stakeholders' perceptions of the need for a nationally coordinated approach in the establishment of an Association of POs, which concurs with the literature. However, stakeholders have not emphasised the benefits of Interbranch Organisations (IBOs), which involve vertical collaboration with other chain actors such as processors and retailers, an approach that has proven successful internationally. Nor have Irish stakeholders identified the potential of differentiating or premiumising beef products, which, according to international evidence, is necessary for improving profitability and farm-level incomes. Stakeholders identified the main threats to the future success of POs in Ireland as members' lack of commitment and processors' lack of willingness to engage with POs.",,10.1080/00036846.2018.1489114,Region-based relationship banking policy; regional bank; branch; loans and bills discounted; profit ratio

The results indicated that regional banks with more branches can increase their loans and bills discounted as well as their small and mid-sized enterprises loans and bills discounted. Thus, establishing more branches is effective in increasing the total sum of loans and bills discounted by each bank because regional banks with many branches can make contact with more customers. On the other hand, return on assets and return on equity of regional banks with more branches were found to be lower. Therefore, regarding the cost performance of regional banks, establishing too many branches and maintaining branch networks that are too large can have negative effects on regional banks.",,10.1108/IJSE-01-2021-0028,Impact of SACCOS' services; Livelihood outcomes; Mwanza; Tabora; Rural areas

Design/methodology/approach The study employed a quasi-experimental design. Six SACCOS were purposively selected in four districts of Mwanza and Tabora regions in Tanzania. A sample of 500 respondents was randomly selected of whom 200 were SACCOS' members and 300 were non-members. A questionnaire and a key informant interview guide were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to analyse the quantitative data whereas qualitative data was subjected to thematic analysis. Findings The results indicate that SACCOS' services had significantly impacted on the household livelihood outcomes in terms of maize yields, household assets, savings, food expenditures and non-food expenditures. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted in two regions of Tanzania using six SACCOS. Similar studies can be conducted in a larger area of Tanzania by capturing more than six SACCOS. In addition, the study focused on the rural areas of Tanzania. The future studies can be carried out in urban areas or both urban and rural areas of Tanzania. Practical implications Local leaders, SACCOS' leaders and other stakeholders in the study area should thus mobilise non-members in their areas to join SACCOS. In addition, the Tanzania government should facilitate the formation of new SACCOS and strengthen those already operating in rural areas. Social implications SACCOS provide opportunities for individuals and households in rural areas to converge socially and economically to achieve better results (positive impact on livelihood outcomes), which otherwise could be non-achievable through single household or individual efforts. Originality/value Unlike previous studies, this study provides empirical evidence on the impact of SACCOS' services on livelihood outcomes of SACCOS members in rural areas of Tanzania where abject poverty is widespread and where the majority of SACCOS are found.",,10.51341/1984-3925_2021v24n1a7,Management Control System; Credit Cooperatives; Strategic Uncertainty; Strategic Risk; Simons' Levers of Control

Method: This is a quantitative study, conducted as a survey with a sample of 57 credit cooperatives. The data was analyzed through Structural equation modeling, with partial least square estimation on SmartPLS 3.0 software. The strategic risk and strategic uncertainty constructs were analyzed in relation to their connection with Simons' Levers of Control (1995), which contemplates the beliefs and boundary controls and interactive and diagnostic control systems. Furthermore, the connections between the four Levers of Control are also analyzed. Originality/Relevance: The study covers the antecedents (strategic risks and uncertainties) of MCS use, contemplating different compositions of type and class in credit cooperatives, taking previous studies into consideration, as well as covering a singular and pertinent region in the context of Brazilian credit cooperatives. Results: Strategic risk is not associated with the use of the Management Control System. Strategic uncertainty was proven to be the element that receives the most importance from managers in the process of using the four Levers of Control. Regarding the beliefs system construct, its importance is positively linked to the interactive control system, as also occurs with the connection between the interactive control system and the diagnostic control system. Theoretical/Methodological contributions: The study demonstrates the pertinence of the Levers of Control for credit cooperatives, inserted in the context of strategic risks and uncertainties. Social/management contributions: The findings bring about relevant contributions by proving that the balanced use of the four Levers of Control is relevant for promoting the strategic renovation of credit cooperatives, especially regarding strategic uncertainty.",,10.1037/apl0000025,employee voice; status characteristics; discrimination

Further, supervisors are more likely to recognize voice from employees who have higher achieved status-cued by their centrality in informal social structures. The authors also find that even when certain groups of lower status employees speak up more, they cannot compensate for the negative effect of their demographic membership on voice recognition by their boss. The authors underscore how recognition of employee voice by supervisors matters for employees.

With a chequered history of state and donor intervention management, Dakawa, Rice Farm in Mvomero District is now collectively farmed by a cooperative society of 'small farmers'. It is widely hailed as a success, both of irrigation production, and of 'small farmers' in delivering this. However, such narratives of smallness and success obscure a more complex reality in which smallness of scale may be more of a discursive tool than a reflection of empirical reality.

Consequently the election of board members has become an object of interest. A successful election process is assumed to generate a competent board. Many of the studies discuss the topic in the context of public limited companies. However, cooperative seldom emerge in these studies. This has both academic and practical consequences: the understanding on the cooperative governance does not accumulate and practitioners do not have in-depth knowledge available in order to develop their cooperatives. What make cooperatives different from other firms are a broad member base, customer, worker, and entrepreneur relationships to the cooperative and differences in the governing bodies. These features have special implications on the governances of cooperatives.

The goal is to figure out what we know about the governance and the election of board members in cooperatives.

Most students and members of present-day organizations would expect that this communication is driven by a prodevelopment logic-that communication serves the purpose of organizational improvement and competitiveness. Our unique historical evidence on learning-related communication over multiple decades shows that the subjective and collective attitude toward prodevelopment communication may be ideologically conditioned. Prodevelopment communication is the norm in capitalist organizations, but competing ideologies may emphasize other goals higher than organizational development. Consequently, increasing challenges to capitalism as the ideological basis of economic organization can have deep impacts on how organizations learn and produce innovations in the future.

Design/methodology/approach - Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings - The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications - It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications - The research confirms that individual dairy farmer's loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value - Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province.",,,rural credit cooperatives; crisis management; strategy

Research into the Reindeer Herding Industry has been conducted in order to gain information on their management and to develop a socially-oriented strategy conducive to overcoming the accumulated problems. Institutional transformation is a mechanism through which the accumulated problems of herding can be addressed, and the industry can be shifted from a pattern of regression towards evolutionary development. Institutional transformation is based in the ethnic and economic features of the reindeer herding family and ancestral households and directed towards correcting the defects of the legal system and the system of herding management. The conflict between the needs of family and ancestral farms, the resources of the traditional economy, and the established institutions pose challenges - ideological (political), social, economic, and ecological - to the system of management. The organizational model for institutional transformation in the reindeer herding industry is founded on the confirmation of the private farm as the primary legal form of organization for reindeer herding, supplemented by competence centers, reindeer herding parks, the legal, organizational entity of the agricultural consumer cooperative, and novel measures of state support for family and traditional households. These findings indicate a connection between the problems of reindeer herding, indigenous peoples, and national settlements.

The industry has been in existence for over one hundred years but have suffered a stunted development due to neglect by policy makers. Wood carving is an important and long established traditional artifact industry in Ibadan metropolis and Oyo township. The industry has a very rich cultural background that has influenced in no small way, its organization, products and survival. Socio-economic assessment of wood artifact products in Oyo state, Nigeria was carried out with a view to determining the value of the enterprise. Structured questionnaires were administered on the wood carvers. Purposive sampling method was adopted in selecting the respondents. Forty questionnaires were given to wood carvers of which thirty two (80 per cent) were duly filled and returned. The study showed that a large number of people are engaged in the industry which has a high potential for employment and fuller utilization of timber resources. The product quality is greatly affected by the carvers' skills as well as the tree species used. Results showed that the industry is profitable with an average Gross Margin of N333,274.50 and an average Net Return of N328,304.50 annually per enterprise. The wood carving industry is beset with some problems, prominent among these are lack of finance for expansion, narrow market, cultural belief and poor business organization. It is recommended that the carvers must of necessity team up as a cooperative society for a proper development of the industry which in turn would foster government assistance to provide incentives for wood carving industry in Nigeria.",,,

The agricultural producers' cooperative game problem in contract farming is formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear program. Using the strong duality theory of stochastic linear programs, we not only prove that the core of agricultural producers' cooperative game is nonempty but also provide a simple way to compute a profit allocation policy in the core. We establish the convexity of agricultural producers' cooperative game so that the game has population monotonicity, which gives agricultural producers an incentive to expand their current coalition. We then analyze the agricultural producers' cooperative game with a concave cost structure, which may exhibit economies of scale for production. Taking advantage of the proposed stochastic duality approach, the agricultural producers' cooperative game with a concave cost structure is also shown to have a nonempty core.",,,co-operative difference; behavioural innovativeness; transformational leadership; team collaboration; innovative culture

When behavioural innovativeness is concerned, the socially oriented activities of co-operatives suggest that specific values and behaviours within such organisations may influence their innovativeness. Hence, this research aims at better understanding how this co-operative difference impact on the co-operative innovativeness. In order to answer this objective, the research focused on the particular case of the Federation des caisses populaires acadiennes (FCPA), a Canadian second-level financial service co-operative, and 13 of its credit unions. A questionnaire was administered online to a population of 888 employees, with a response rate of 65.1% (578 respondents). The component analysis of 9 statements on behaviours and values oriented towards innovation and improvement resulted in two factors accounting for a satisfactory 62.5% of the variance. The two factors represented components of the behavioural innovativeness in terms of the supervisor's transformational leadership, and team collaboration. Hypotheses were made suggesting the positive relationship between the two factors and behavioural innovativeness as expressed by the commitment of the employees towards the success of the cooperative and the improved quality of its services. Moreover, it was suggested that a cooperative difference, as perceived by the employees, would positively affect the relationship between the cultural factors and the behavioural innovativeness. Results of the structural analysis of the conceptual framework, using Lisrel 9, showed a significant and positive full mediation of the co-operative difference between the supervisor's transformational leadership and the co-operative behavioural, and a partial mediating role of the co-operative difference between team collaboration and behavioural innovativeness. These results are of interest for cooperative managers. With a focus on specific human resources practices aimed at enhancing an innovative culture at the management and the team levels, they could contribute to build a co-operative difference in the workforce and from these efforts, develop the organisational commitment towards innovation.",,10.17730/humo.52.4.4650487532761447,IDEOLOGY; INDIVIDUALISM; PRODUCER COOPERATIVES; SMALL BOAT FISHERS

Design/methodology/approach An event study was performed using 240 days pre-event period and an event period that consisted of 25 days pre and 25 days post the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement in Kenya. The difference in differences (DiD) method was also used for cause-effect analysis for two years before and three years after the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement. The outcome variable was firm value, whereas the treatment and control groups were Kenyan listed firms and deposit-taking credit unions, respectively. Findings The event study method found cumulative abnormal returns after the date of the board diversity reforms announcement to be positive and significant. The DiD methods found a positive and significant market reaction to the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement in Kenya. Research limitations/implications This study was limited by the secondary data that was collected and analyzed from financial statements and stock price data from the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). Financial statements have the disadvantage of being affected by the judgment and estimates of their preparers or accountants. Practical implications Emerging markets like the NSE are vulnerable to market manipulation by insiders. Efficient stock markets are known to attract more investors who are interested in a trustworthy stock price determination mechanism. The Capital Market Authority should thus continue implementing corporate governance reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of the NSE and the trustworthiness of stock prices therein. The continued reforms thus imply better value for money for the NSE investors. Originality/value This study makes an important contribution to literature by combining an event study and DiD analysis to assess market reaction to board diversity reform announcements in emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa which is a concept that has not been researched before. Past studies have used event studies to investigate the efficiency status of stock markets in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the current study used an additional method of DiD and hence contributed to literature.",,,logistics systems; dairy sector; cooperation

This is a particularly challenging problem being faced by the small and marginal farmers in any emerging economy. Farmer collectives (FCs) which are cooperative societies of farmers, launched under Federal Government initiatives in many countries, offer the prospect of enabling cost-effective procurement of inputs with assured quality. We seek, in this work, sound and explainable mechanisms for the above important use-case. In particular, we propose the use of incentive compatible auction mechanisms that could be used by an FC to procure quality inputs in bulk. The idea is the following. An FC collects from the farmers their individual requirements for inputs and aggregates them into different buckets. For each bucket, the FC identifies suppliers who meet the quality criteria and engages them in a competitive procurement auction. We explore in this paper, two particular types of procurement auctions: volume discount auctions and combinatorial auctions in the framework of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms. These are explainable mechanisms that induce truthful bids from the suppliers as well as maximize the social welfare. We show their efficacy through carefully designed thought experiments. Our field studies of FCs give us the confidence that such mechanisms, if deployed systematically, can become a game changer, benefiting a massive community of smallholder farmers.",,10.1080/10253866.2018.1462175,Political consumption; agencing; concerning; representational practices; market practices; cooperative retailing

The credit cooperative movement that grew up in Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century had to wrestle with both. These cooperatives thrived, in part, because they adopted strategies first to obtain and then to harness the information they needed about the communities in which they were located, giving them an advantage over other lenders. Particularly effective was the tactic of using local people as managers, which helped to cement their ties with the community. Yet because few, if any, locals had banking experience and most were not even familiar with basic accounting methods, the managers created internal management problems, intensifying outside suspicion of the cooperatives as banking enterprises. The methods the cooperatives developed to overcome these problems drew on a combination of local initiative and regional assistance that was typical of the movement as a whole.

The revenue model predicts that a government's source of revenue determines whether elites invest in effective bureaucracy and the provision of public goods that benefit wide swaths of society or the extraction of resources from society to benefit a limited network. In this model, a cooperative society with high social capital is an outcome of effective, collective government. The combined model predicts that social capital has a semi-independent causal effect, in addition to revenue, on the inclusiveness of governments.

,social-republican property,"SIMON, WH",UCLA LAW REVIEW,0041-5650,38,6,1335-1413,1991,UNIV CALIF,,"To stay ahead of their competitors, firms need to create and develop proactive strategies that emphasize factors that differentiate them from others in their sector. In this sense and given the current scenario of marketplace instability and uncertainty, the way firms develop and manage their intellectual capital (IC) is crucial. Firms can be distinguished from their rivals in terms of their ability to identify, invest in and manage their IC - in other words the knowledge over which they exercise control or influence - an intangible asset that is not as easily quantifiable or replicable as other assets. In today's globalized and highly competitive world, the only way to compete with producers benefiting from low production costs is to invest in people, and this requires organizations to believe in the creative ability, emotional intelligence and adaptability of their staff and collaborators. Human resources with appropriate skills, motivation and commitment are the key to increased competitiveness because only they have the capacity to create products and services with greater value for the consumer and thereby generate better performance by the organization. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of IC as a key driver of organizational performance due to its centrality as an asset in the value creation process (Chen, Shih and Yang, 2009; Kang and Snell, 2009; Campisini and Costa, 2008). However, few studies have demonstrated the relationship that may be developed between various aspects of IC and the satisfaction felt by the staff involved (Longo and Mura, 2011). Employee satisfaction (in general) and promotion opportunities expressing organizational recognition of staff contributions (in particular) provide a stimulus to greater committed to the organization's interests and thereby enhance productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. Clearly, since human resources (HR) constitute the only asset that, strictly speaking, the organization does not own, and that the time and money it spends on training can easily be wasted if staff turnover is high, it is crucial for 21st century organizations of all types to attract, develop and above all retain qualified, committed and satisfied staff. Our focus on Credit Cooperatives (CC) is explained by their emergence as a significant alternative to large financial corporations - especially private banks. CCs are able to offer specific and attractive benefits to their members and can play a key role in stimulating socioeconomic development at the territorial level (Araujo and Silva, 2011; Segui-Mas and Izquierdo, 2010). The aims of the research reported on here were (1) to identify which aspects of IC most influence employee satisfaction in the financial institutions analyzed and (2) to specify the type of influence these dimensions have on staff satisfaction. Data were collected using a questionnaire based on Bontis (1998) applied to all employees of a CC in north-eastern Brazil. After processing the data using SPSS 21.0, it was found that (1) Human Capital is not an unidimensional concept and was further subdivided into training and participation; and (2) only structural and relational dimensions of IC affected respondents' satisfaction positively. By making known to organizational leaders and managers that there exists a link - albeit indirect - between IC and organizational performance may encourage them to invest more in an intangible asset that has the intrinsic ability to create sustainable flows of value for both client and organization.",,,

In this article, we propose a partially-centralized organization of consumers (or agents), namely, a consumer cooperative that purchases electricity from the market. In the cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group. The technical challenge is that consumers make their own demand decisions, based on their private demand constraints and preferences, which they do not share with the coordinator or other agents. We propose a novel multiagent coordination algorithm, to shape the energy demand of the cooperative. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information, the coordinator determines virtual price signals that it sends to the consumers to induce them to shift their demands when required. We prove that this algorithm converges to the central optimal solution and minimizes the electric energy cost of the cooperative. Additionally, we present results on the time complexity of the iterative algorithm and its implications for agents' incentive compatibility. Furthermore, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to (a) characterize the convergence properties of our algorithm and (b) understand the effect of differing demand characteristics of participants as well as of different price functions on the cost reduction. The results show that the convergence time scales linearly with the agent population size and length of the optimization horizon. Finally, we observe that as participants' flexibility of shifting their demands increases, cost reduction increases and that the cost reduction is not sensitive to variation in consumption patterns of the consumers.",,10.3390/su142113862,project management information system (PMIS); DeLone and McLean IS model (D&M-IS); information system financial wellness (IS-FW) model; stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R); cooperative society; self-help groups (SHGs)

Consolidation that is occurring in the financial services industry has spilled over into agricultural banking. This has raised concerns as to whether banks that have traditionally supplied credit to production agriculture will continue to do so after consolidation. Another major concern is whether consolidation is motivated by greater efficiency, or whether consolidation is resulting in greater market power without achieving cost savings. Study of the production technology of financial institutions can determine whether and to what degree economies of size exist and how agricultural lending will fit into the overall business plans of consolidated banks. Generally, empirical studies have used either duality theory with the estimation of cost functions or nonparametric estimation methods to assess efficiency in the financial services industry. The purpose of the present study is to estimate economies of scope and scale in agricultural banking. This will be accomplished through estimation of an indirect multi-product cost function. The uniqueness of this study, when compared to previous studies of efficiency of the financial services industry, i's the disaggregation of the outputs so that agricultural lending can be evaluated. In addition, a normalized quadratic cost function is estimated with curvature properties imposed. Clark reviewed thirteen studies that measured economies of scope and scale for commercial banks, credit unions, and savings and loan associations. He found that they offered four broad conclusions: (a) overall economies of scale exist at low levels of input, (b) no consistent evidence of economies of scope exists, (c) some evidence of cost complementarities exists, and (d) the results seem to be robust among financial institutions. Humphery also reviewed studies that examine the issue of economies of scale for banks and found that little cost savings exist for increases in size alone. He concluded that significant benefits accrue from loan diversification. Humphery also reported that the differences in cost structure within the same firm size category are larger than measured cost economies. Berger, Hunter, and Timme reviewed the efficiency of financial institutions. They discovered that many of the previous studies showed the average cost curve to be relatively flat. They also suggested that differences in technologies may occur between small and large banks or that some factor that varies with bank size may be excluded from previous studies. McAllister and McManus found that the translog cost function specification gives a poor approximation when applied to all bank sizes, suggesting that nonparametric estimation procedures should be examined. In addition, they included risk as a cost factor in the estimation. Berger, Hunter, and Timme suggested that, although frontier estimation methods are theoretically correct, studies that have compared results of frontier methods to those of more traditional estimation methods have found only small differences for scale measures.",,,People Management; Information; Sharing Information; Credit cooperative

To extend this literature, the present study examines how the economist and landowner Leone Wollemborg (1859-1932) acted as an 'accountable self', explaining his own actions to the 'other', to promote a new organisational model aimed at solving the credit issue affecting the rural population. Based on archival material, the article explores Wollemborg's biography and develops a content analysis of his discourses. The findings show that, by making a pervasive use of face-to-face narrative accountability, Wollemborg obtained trust and engagement of external potential stakeholders, thus expanding the rural credit cooperatives (Raiffeisen-style).

I call the genus including all such species situated cognition and go on to depict selected cases in nonhuman comparative cognition. Distributed cognition is often used as another term for situated cognition. But behavioral biologists have used the term in another sense, to mean the reduction of cognitive capacities arising from team work in cooperative societies. Hymenopteran insects have been studied as cases. The octopus displays embodied cognition, with some of the computational work offloaded to the periphery. Web-building spiders showcase extended cognition, in which objects external to the animal-the web, in the case of spiders-play a crucial causal role in cognition. A criterion of mutual manipulability, in which causal influence flows both ways between organism and extended object, serves to delimit the scope of extended cognition. Play in dogs features intelligence on-the-run, arising out of action, a key characteristic of enactive cognition. I discuss other cases in which action entwines with central representational cognition to achieve goal-directed behavior.

As a result there is greater awareness of safety concerns, emerging risks and challenges in the context of food products. Consumers want guarantees for food characteristics, thus, calling for transparency and effective response in case of any food related health problem. This paper presents a framework for transparency, traceability and information flow for management of dairy supply chain networks. This paper follows a case study approach and presents findings from three types of dairy supply chains as prevalent in India. The paper analyses complexity of dairy products as well as processes in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors and their effects on the underlying dairy supply chain networks (DSCN). Governance mechanisms dovetailing various stages of the DSCN are presented in terms of their gaps and adequacy. Key components of the presented frameworks are harmonization of national standards with codex standards, hygiene control, strengthening quality control systems, enhancing information flow across stages, animal health care, disease free zones and formation of cooperatives of small dairy processors (CSDP) in line with the present dairy cooperative society (DCS). CSDP aims at collective action and public-private partnerships by the unorganized sector units to face the competition from large organized processors of dairy products in terms of quality, transparency, traceability and information flow. Transparency of a DSCN is the extent to which all its stakeholders have a shared understanding of and access to the product related information without loss, noise, delay and distortion. Given the perishable nature of dairy products, an effective traceability system is an important tool not only to manage food quality and safety risks, but also to promote the development of effective dairy supply chain management. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on transparency and traceability issues of dairy supply chain networks. Findings would be useful for policy makers in framing standards and effective regulations. Analysis of complexity would be useful for dairy industry managers.",,10.1080/19420676.2021.1952478,Social innovation; social economy; networking; social change; social transformation

This has changed relations both within the initiative and in its networks, while, at the same time, allows for increased innovativeness capacities.

Adopting a broad class of such technologies and practices is often critical for meeting the multifaceted goals of efficiency, profitability, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience. This study aims to address the knowledge gaps that still exist concerning what determines the adoption of improved technologies and production practices, the factors affecting their diffusion, the impact of interventions on productivity and crops grown, and the variability of impact within a particular country context. In this paper we address these questions using data collected as part of the USAID-led Knowledge-Based Integrated Sustainable Agriculture in Nepal (KISAN) project. We adopted a multistage sampling technique and surveyed 988 beneficiary households and 997 non-beneficiary households in KISAN intervention districts and non-intervention districts. Our findings suggest that, in Nepal, adoption of improved technologies and practices is significantly increased by improved access to markets, private sector involvement in selling improved seeds and disseminating information, membership in progressive farmers groups and cooperative societies, participation in agricultural training and farm visits, provision of subsidies for seeds, and access to credit. We also found the probability of the adoption of improved practices to be affected by farmers' sources of information; for instance, the adoption of improved practices was increased when farmers obtained information from informal sources, cooperatives/farmers organizations, and public and private extension programs. The effects of KISAN projects vary significantly across the different crops grown, based on the evaluation models that address self-selection of both project participation and crop choices. These implications may also apply to other parts of the world facing similar challenges as Nepal, where limited market access, insufficient knowledge and resource capacity of farmers constrain their adoption of improved technologies and practices in agriculture.",,,

Using data from rural credit cooperatives in China for 2008-2014, we find that rural cooperative banks have better capital adequacy than banks under two other forms of ownership. We further find that among four possible reform pathways, only restructuring from a rural cooperative bank to a rural commercial bank enhances capital adequacy significantly and that improvements in capital adequacy generally weaken over time. Further analyses indicate that this improvement is primarily attributable to capital injections and removal of non-performing assets by the government.

As an example, agro-industrial enterprises of Kemerovo region were taken. Research strategy is directed to the analysis of qualitative and quantitative information on the condition of an object, the use of such empiric methods as statistic data analyses, unstructured interviews with executives, and employee questionnaires. In 2017, the Federal Program was adopted, in order to increase labor productivity and contribute to employment. To implement the Program, representatives of enterprises of all fields and all business entities must participate actively. The results of an expert interview demonstrate that executives are very concerned with the problem of low labor productivity in the whole country, in Kemerovo region, in their own enterprises, and can see the ways of its solution, but they are not included properly in corresponding managing aspects. On the average, in the agro-industrial sector the labor productivity increase goes on faster than in other industrial fields of our country, but in terms of value it is low. When workers of a Kuzbass enterprise containing of two agricultural consumer cooperatives for the production of dairy products were questioned, it was revealed that there were the following problems: bad condition of equipment and mechanisms, uncomfortable work and rest schedule, unsatisfactory working tension and rhythm, ineffective system of work stimulation, insufficient social support for workers, and others. So, the factors of labor productivity growth lay in the economic and logistical areas as well as organizational and social ones.

In particular, recognizing that management control change is a continuous organizational process (rather than an outcome), the trajectory of which is shaped by an incessant inter-play of several influences, this research intends to explore the way in which the implementation of a new integrated information system contributes to this process. To address this issue, the current research combines theoretical and empirical insights. After having reviewed the literature on the main topics and produced a theoretical understanding to illuminate the nature of the aforementioned changes, the research relies upon an illustrative case study concerning a medium-size cooperative society based in Italy. Recognising the complexity of organizational life, the field study does not aspire to isolate and define how and by how much ICT has been a driver of the management control change, but rather to explore the whole process of change in order to appreciate the diversity of interrelated influences which have shaped its trajectory and how these influences interacted with each-other. Among this inter-play of influences, the study aims then to investigate the particular role played by the two-way relationship between ICT and management control. The implementation of the new integrated information system has opened up several opportunities for the business management and in particular for the management control. However, so far, only part of these opportunities have been exploited. Furthermore, while it could be acknowledged that the new system facilitated the changes in management control both in its material and immaterial dimensions, it could not be concluded that they were the result of the implementation of the new system. Many other factors have interacted within the process of management control change. For example, of paramount importance has been the controller's determination to enact the change. The case study analyzes these factors and the way in which they have jointly facilitated and/or hindered the management control change.",,10.1111/j.1468-232X.1995.tb00387.x,

Here we argue that explicit and implicit forms of profit sharing should be viewed as two sides of the same coin, and can both be given convincing theoretical foundations. Relevant models include the importance of fairness and equitable pay and repeated games with mutual monitoring by profit or rent-sharing workers. Most empirical work has neglected the selection problem, or the existence of favourable but unobserved preconditions for profit sharing, and so probably exaggerates productivity gains from profit sharing in isolation and benefits from tax incentives.

Subsequently, the practices of the form transformed, especially after the Russian-Ottoman War, concomitant with further changes in Ottoman society's institutional order. Although OMSs initially enjoyed legitimacy granted by the Ottoman State, the shift towards dominating state logic in the Hamidian era led to the erosion of practices animated by market and community logics.

Using unique organisational and market level data from Ethiopia, we then test empirically whether the observed (weak) performance of producers' cooperatives in Africa is explained by their organisational boundary - the type and range of goods or services they provide to members. The empirical results confirm that the competitiveness of producers' cooperatives is significantly correlated with the type and number of services - i.e. cooperatives that provide club goods and a limited range of services are found to be more competitive. The results also suggest that a considerable number of cooperatives in Ethiopia engage in markets where they do not have competitive advantage.

Retail consolidation, technological change in production and marketing, and growing consumer demand for produce, have altered the traditional market relationships between producers, wholesalers, and retailers.

Extremism is modelled as a production factor whose effect on expected revenue is initially positive and then turns negative, and whose level is optimally chosen by a revolutionary organization. The organization is bound by a free-access constraint and hence uses the degree of extremism as a means of indirectly controlling its level of membership with the aim of maximizing expected per capita income of its members, like a producer co-operative. The gist of the argument is that radicalization may be an optimal reaction to perceived failure (a widespread perception in the Muslim world) when political activists are, at the margin, relatively strongly averse to effort but not so averse to extremism. This configuration is at odds with secular, Western-style revolutionary politics but seems to capture well the essence of Islamic revolutionary politics, embedded as it is in a doctrinal framework.",,10.22279/navus.2019.v9n2.p24-39.757,Collaborators; Motivation; Perception; Strategic Remuneration; Incentive Systems

It is well known that in the absence of regulatory mitigation the population density has a positive effect on broadband diffusion. Hence, we measure the effect of the population density on the determinants of broadband diffusion throughout the postal codes of Finland via Geographically Weighted Regression. We suggest that the main determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density follow a spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong strength or non-concentric convex/concave. Based on 10 patterns, we argue that the Finnish spectrum policy encouraged Mobile Network Operators to satisfy ambitious Universal Service Obligations without the need for a Universal Service Fund. Spectrum auctions facilitated infrastructure-based competition via equitable spectrum allocation and coverage obligation delivery via low-fee licenses. However, state subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract investment from nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies encouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber consumer cooperatives. To explain this emergence, we show that when population density decreases, the level of mobile service quality decreases and community commitment increases. Hence, we recommend regulators implementing market-driven strategies for 5G to stimulate local investment. For example, by allocating the 3.5 GHz and higher bands partly through local light licensing.",,,

The leading methods of the study are an abstract-logical method, the 5W + 1H formula set, as well as information theories, probabilities, and statistical methods.

The use of a multicriterial selection model is demonstrated on the example of the informational need of an agricultural agrotechnical consumer cooperative for updating the material and technical resources. The significance of the research topic is determined by the fact that in most cases for small agribusiness, information is the only resource (capital) at the initial stage of operation.

However, in the course of the operation of microfinance companies, due to the lack of careful management and risk control, the problem of risk management has become increasingly prominent. The purpose of this paper is to study the microfinance risk based on polygenic artificial neural network, and it provides theory and practice application for risk management of microcredit enterprises. Taking the risk management of China's microfinance companies as the research object, on the basis of previous studies, this paper analyzes the risks of bank microfinance companies. Secondly, the basic theory of neural network model and its transformation function are introduced, and the learning method of neural network. At the same time, the learning algorithm of neural network and its improved algorithm are mainly introduced. It lays a theoretical foundation for the follow-up empirical research. Then, through the empirical study of data-based risk assessment of microcredit of farmers, the sample data are divided into training samples and test samples for comparison. Then, we use MATLAB software to establish a neural network model for farmers' microcredit risk assessment. Finally, in order to make the neural network model of farmers' credit risk assessment better popularize and apply, and effectively reduce the credit risk of farmers' microcredit. The corresponding policy suggestions are put forward, which proves the validity and applicability of the neural network in the field of farmers' microcredit risk assessment.

State interference in the functioning of financial institutions is necessary, especially for those of their types, whose bankruptcy may have fatal consequences for the welfare of the population and cause the liquidation of economic entities of the domestic economy. Among them are: banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and other institutions of credit co-operation, investment companies, in particular, joint investment institutions (unit and corporate investment funds), non-state pension funds, leasing, factoring, and other financial companies, pawns, etc. Therefore, it is expedient to consider the possibility of the influence of state regulators in financial services markets on the state of their participants' economic security. However, the study of the realities of the financial market of Ukraine development has made it possible to assert that for a number of financial institutions, the concept of economic security is something abstract, and the understanding by their top management the importance of economic security management, taking into account the negative market trends, is completely absent. So, the purpose of this study is to diagnose the level of financial institutions preparedness for the implementation of economic security management into their common system of management. The high level of financial market participants' readiness for safe-oriented management will allow regulators to rapidly implement in their practice a list of recommendations that will minimize the threat of bankruptcy and liquidation of domestic financial institutions. Methodology. In the process of preparing a scientific article, a great number of literary sources was considered. Some of them were developed using the method of theoretical generalization and the monographic method. The theoretical results presented in the research materials were obtained on the basis of the study of works of such scientists as Amadae S. M., Baily M. N., Elliott D. J., Ismail Z., Johnson K. N., Mirtchev A., Nelson J. A., Raczkowski K., Schneider F., Sidek Z. M., Ula M., Whalen C. J., Wierzbicka E., Yong J. To confirm the reliability of the scientific results presented in the article, the authors used the Delphi method and expert evaluation. The list of indicators for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of a mechanism for managing economic security in the following five areas is formed. These areas are: the availability and condition of the economic security system, the state of information and analytical support for the adoption of management decisions in the field of economic security, the state of intellectual and personnel management provision of economic security, reserves of financial support of economic security, the level of external influence on the state of economic security (state regulation and supervision). In May 2018, representatives of the top management of various types of financial institutions, scientists, researchers, and analysts who were interested in the issues of economic security management of the financial sector were interviewed. Their answers were analysed and the level of readiness for managing the economic security of the most common types of financial institutions in the financial market of Ukraine was determined. Using the graphical method, the obtained scientific results are presented in a convenient and understandable form for the perception of all interested persons. Results of the survey. The necessity of carrying out diagnostics of the readiness to manage economic security at the level of state regulatory bodies and at the level of top management of financial institutions in the near future is substantiated. A large-scale analytical work was carried out on determining the parameters of financial institutions readiness for the continuous and professional economic security management, which should be carried out with the use of a systematic approach. Based on expert opinions, a preliminary assessment of the various types of financial intermediaries' readiness to integrate security-oriented management into the financial institutions' common management system was made. Practical implications. The proposed methodological approach for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness to manage their own economic security should be used by the state regulators of the financial market, in particular, by the National Bank of Ukraine and the National Commission, which performs state regulation in the field of financial services markets, to monitor the activities of professional financial market participants in order to conduct advisory and consultative work with their owners and managers, as well as for the development of strategic guidelines for the provision of the state financial security. It is desirable to implement into the practical activities of financial intermediaries our proposals for increasing the readiness for implementation of the economic security management mechanism in the existing systems of management. Value/originality. For the first time, a scoring methodology was prepared for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of economic security management as an independent direction of management, and not as one of the tasks of other types of their management activity. At the theoretical level, the substantive interpretation of the notion of the readiness of financial institutions to manage their own economic security is proposed. The reasons for the impossibility of the modern financial institutions to manage their own economic security effectively are identified, and a few suggestions to minimize their number in the near future were made.",,10.1006/jcec.1997.1463,

Contrary to received wisdom, labor-managed firms are not smaller than conventional firms; they grow as fast or faster in all industries. The two groups of firms organize production differently. Labor-managed firms are as productive as conventional firms, or more productive, in all industries, and use their inputs efficiently; but in several industries conventional firms would produce more with their current input levels if they organized production like labor-managed firms.

This result is robust to alternative estimation strategies based on semiparametric and parametric frailty duration models that take into account unobserved firm-level heterogeneity and impose a range of distributional assumptions about the shape of the baseline hazard. The higher survival rates of worker-managed firms seem to be associated with their greater employment stability.

This paper discusses the selected issues of corporate governance in the cooperative banking sector in Poland. It outlines the contemporary challenges of corporate governance principles in the Polish cooperative banking sector related to external and internal supervision of banking activity. In addition, this paper aims to answer the question whether and to what extent the Polish cooperative banks have adopted the recommendation of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority with regard to corporate governance in the banking sector and the extent to which internal rules for the organization of these banks affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the market. As a result, the following hypothesis was put forward: implementation of the corporate governance principles in the Polish cooperative banks has not contributed significantly to the improvement of their efficiency and has not enhanced the institutional supervision and internal controls in the cooperative banks. According to the authors, despite the existence of corporate governance principles in all Polish cooperative banks, there is still problem with the effectiveness of these institutions. Cooperative banks in Poland have experienced the phase of lethargy since 2013 and reported weaker and weaker financial results. Having in mind the fact that in 2015, that is after 14 years of stability in the sector, one of the Polish largest cooperative banks, SK-Bank, got bankruptcy, nobody predicted this event. It concludes that when it comes to the corporate governance principles the management bodies, regulators as well as supervisors require more effectively cooperation. The results in this paper confirmed that the model of credit cooperative movement adopted in Poland requires implementation of a couple of basic changes that are directly related to the utilization of the principles of a good corporate governance.

Access to financial services has allowed many low-income families to make significant progress in their own efforts to escape poverty. The government supports the growth of MFI services through many instruments, such as regulations, subsidy, and directed credit policies. Currently, there are two broad classification of microfince institutions in Indonesia, i.e., bank-MFIs such as BM's Unit Desas and rural banks (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat-BPR), and non-bank MFIs such as credit cooperatives (Koperasi), Islamic microfinance (such as Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, BMT), rotary-club saving (arisan), etc. As a business unit, the MFIs must follow the principle of efficiency to survive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of one type of the MFI in Indonesia, namely Syariahrural banks (BPR-S). The common approach to measure the level of efficiency of a business unit used by management is financial approach, such as ratio of operating expenses to operating income. However, economists normally use production function approach or its derivation to measure the efficiency. We are comparing the two approaches to evaluate the efficiency levels of the BPR-S. The results show that the efficiency levels of the BPR-S are generally operating in a good efficiency. Efficiently ratios of BPR-S during the sample period of time have been mostly above 90%. The efficiency based on the financial ratios confirms the finding from the production function approach. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach - Survey data used in this study is obtained by drawing a sample of 1902 farmers who are members of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives Union (ACCU) from 37 provinces of Turkey. Pearson's Chi-square test is used to analyze the association between the demographic features of farmers, conventional bank usage and Islamic bank usage. Binary logistic regression model is used to estimate the factors influencing the preference for Islamic banks. Explanatory variables include knowledge on Islamic banking and finance, perception of compliance to religion, saving ability and cost concern along with the control variables of Islamic bank branch number in the region and age of respondent. Robustness check is conducted via alternative models using ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression. Findings - Less than 10% of the participant farmers use Islamic banks and 59% declare they know nothing about Islamic banking. Age, education level, income level, nonagricultural income level, saving ability, duration of working in agriculture, land size and region are significantly related to farmers' preference of using Islamic banks. Knowledge level, perception of religious compliance, saving ability and cost concern are statistically significant factors that influence the probability of using Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications - This study does not include the analysis of the relationship between being religious and using Islamic banks because questions related to the assessment of religious practice were excluded due to the ACCU's sensitivity to investigate personal beliefs. Therefore, future studies can expand the scope of this research by investigating religiousness. The sample is chosen from the ACCU members who are already benefiting from a formal source of credit; therefore, the results should not be attributed to all farmers. Practical implications - Islamic banks and microfinance institutions' further engagement in the agricultural sector and ACCU's implementation of Islamic finance instruments. Social implications - Islamic banks' further diversification in the agricultural sector and ACCU's implementation of Islamic finance instruments. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the farmers' perception and preference of Islamic banking in Turkey. The sample size of 1902 is much larger and geographically diversified compared to studies in agricultural finance. This study will be valuable for the agricultural finance empirical studies in Turkey as well as an important addition to the emerging literature on Islamic finance.",,,performance; survival; micro broiler; marketing mix

It made use of primary data obtained from a random sample of 112 micro broiler operators. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and Ordinary Least Square Multiple regression approach. The result of analysis revealed that micro broiler business ownership is almost evenly distributed among males 47.32 percent and females 52.68 percent; and that more than half (56.25 percent) of the respondents are within the age brackets of 36-45 years. The study also revealed that respondents had one form of formal education or the other with tertiary education accounting for 75.89 percent. On the survival/competitive advantage of micro broiler firms in the study area, the result of Ordinary Least Square analysis showed that output of broiler, flock size, business experience, mortality and extension contact significantly contributed to a firm survival in broiler business.

This Article presents a case study of a large worker cooperative in South India that has worked well for a long time. This cooperative illustrates, among other things, that worker control and worker democracy are not necessarily inconsistent with the degree of hierarchy and delegation that may be essential to effective operation. The cooperative has been able to compete despite paying wages and benefits that are dramatically higher than those paid by its competitors, while at the same time providing far better working conditions. How it has been able to do this is something of a puzzle. Part of the explanation is good fortune at its inception in attracting effective, honest, and dedicated managers and, subsequently, in avoiding government involvement and in being able to ignore cumbersome and unsuitable legal rules. Perhaps more important is the workplace culture and the ability to harness forms of mutual monitoring not available to competitors. At the end of the day, it is unclear how much of the success of the cooperative is a function of its cooperative nature and how much is a product of its unique circumstances. Still, the story of this enterprise offers useful lessons in the organization of economic activity, particularly in the importance of nonlegal mechanisms for maximizing individual cooperative productivity.",,,

The basic neoclassical model assumes that WMFs maximizes net income per member instead of total profits (Ward, 1958). Even though it has been largely criticized, the Ward model has dominated the self-management literature. Alternative models suggest that WMFs are not only concerned about income per worker but also about the level of employment. However, the empirical content of these competing theoretical models has been rarely analyzed. This paper contributes to fill this gap by estimating the parameters of a generic welfare function, following the methodology proposed by Craig and Pencavel (1993). These parameters determine the relative importance that a WMF places on income per worker vis-a-vis the level of employment. Estimates are based on a long micro-panel of Uruguayan firms covering the entire population of Uruguayan worker-managed firm and conventional firms in 31 3-digit sectors over the period April 1996-December 2005. Following a strictly neoclassical framework, but simply allowing a more general specification of the WMF goals, we show that the assumption of the basic neoclassical model of the WMF is misleading. Our results support the view that WMFs are concerned with both employment and income per worker. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results form part of a larger participatory research project conducted in two climatically representative regions of Tanzania: semi-arid Dodoma and subhumid Morogoro. This paper presents the findings with respect to food processing, waste management and bioenergy, along with income generation and market participation. Assessments on other components of the FVC, including natural resource management, crop production and consumption, are reported by Graef et al (2015). The assessments for food processing revealed preferences for preservation techniques, oil extraction processes and food storage devices for the semi-arid region. In contrast, in the subhumid region, the experts favoured food storage devices and preservation techniques. Assessments of waste management and bioenergy UPS for both regions indicated the importance of animal feed from crop residues, crop residues as mulch and compost from food waste, although with somewhat different priorities. Assessments on income generation and markets in both regions revealed preferences for savings and credit cooperatives and communication techniques, but also indicated that warehouse receipt systems and guarantee systems had a high impact. Assessments differed between the two different climatic regions, and to some extent also between the nationality of experts and their gender. The authors therefore attach importance to integrating different South-North and female-male awareness in assessments among scientists.

Consequently, a number of plans and programs have been proposed and implemented to bring about such development in Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro review of the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land reform of 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the population growth as evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production (1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further deteriorated. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable for agriculture, but only about 19% is cultivated. This suggests an underutilisation of land. Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and education which are essential to development have not been given due attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural technologies used by farmers have changed little in this century. Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most potent economic force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from the central government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total agricultural credit, fertiliser and improved seeds respectively go directly to socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5% of the total cultivated land and 4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises with credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting smallholders, has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in Ethiopia. Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no significant development of agriculture in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform.",,10.4000/rga.7946,Collective Action; Institutions; Specific Product; Mountain cheese; Province of Trento

This article aims at conducting a socio-historical analysis of the institutional context allowing the development of a specific cheese value-chain in the province of Trento (Italian Alps). Using Ostrom's institutionalist approach, we conducted a historical analysis of the formal and informal multilevel institutions. Our results showed that a subsistence economy prevailed between 1800 and 1950, which implied little commitment from the producers to build up collective organisations, despite government and church incentives. When the modernisation of agriculture started around 1950, it meant that the production could be intended for the market, which enabled the development of producers' cooperatives. The province became autonomous in 1948 and supported those local dynamics. Since then, we have observed an increasing level of trust among the different local actors and towards the provincial government. Since 2000, the valorisation of cheese specificity has become a central strategy to face competition at different levels. However, at the same time the production has undergone intensification. This leads to a loss of the link between product and territory. The future challenge is therefore to implement innovative institutional arrangements that allow a sustainable differentiation of cheese.",,10.1177/2056305119879671,Instagram; engagement pods; platformization; precarious labor; cultural workers; algorithm hacking; labor organizing
,participation and productivity - a comparison of worker cooperatives and conventional firms in the plywood industry,"CRAIG, B; PENCAVEL, J",BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,0007-2303,,,121-&,1995,BROOKINGS INST,,"This article examines the phenomenon of Instagram influencer engagement pods as an emergent form of resistance that responds to the reconfigured working conditions of platformized cultural production. Engagement pods are grassroots communities that agree to mutually like, comment on, share, or otherwise engage with each other's posts, no matter the content, to game Instagram's algorithm into prioritizing the participants' content and show it to a broader audience. I argue that engagement pods represent a response to the material conditions of platformized cultural production on Instagram, where proprietary curation algorithms wrest knowledge and control of the labor process from producers. Cooperative algorithm hacking of this sort, although quite distinct from traditional organizing strategies, responds to the coercive force of the threat of invisibility that necessitates constant data production. They represent a collective attempt to exert some control over their conditions of presence-to-others and, in so doing, combat precarity and protect wages in the field. In a post-industrial economy where traditional models of labor organizing have struggled to address the conditions of platformized cultural work, I argue that the unusual phenomenon of Instagram engagement pods represents an organic form of worker resistance that responds to the unique conditions of these workers.",,,

The recent popularity of employee stock ownership plans and the appointment of union and pension fund representatives to several corporate boards has renewed interest in understanding whether employee ownership can make firms more productive and profitable. Few studies, however, have compared the performance of management-run, or ''conventional,'' firms with worker cooperatives. Existing studies usually compare the productivities of firms and workers in different industries. By examining conventional and worker-controlled firms in the same industry, Craig and Pencavel provide a better comparison. The authors analyze data on the inputs and outputs of Northwestern U.S. plywood product mills from 1968 to 1986. Their data contain observations on conventional, union, and worker co-op firms. From these data, the authors try to determine whether cooperatives can produce more output than conventional firms that use the same level of inputs. To determine this, the authors must control for differences in the scale and products of plywood mills. The authors begin by discussing how worker ownership is likely to affect the use and productivity of inputs. They also discuss factors that affect the formation and failure of cooperatives. The authors hypothesize that the availability, cost, and control of capital play key roles in the formation and continuation of cooperatives. The authors next compare output produced per worker, output produced per unit of capital, and output produced per unit of timber input. They find that cooperatives have greater productivity per unit of timber input but lower labor productivity. The cooperatives also operate at larger scales than conventional firms. Craig and Pencavel isolate the effects of scale and differences in factor usage by estimating multifactor production functions. These production functions control for differences in input usage, scale, factor and product prices, and business-cycle effects. Their estimates suggest that cooperatives have slightly better productivities than conventional firms. Output supply function estimates reveal that cooperatives have lower output price elasticities. This latter finding suggests that cooperatives smooth production more than conventional firms when demand unexpectedly changes. In other words, cooperatives are less likely to reduce inputs and output when plywood prices fall or to expand inputs and output when prices rise. Craig and Pencavel conclude that worker ownership does not have ''first-order'' consequences for the factor productivity of plywood product firms. Although they find that plywood cooperatives respond differently to demand and supply shocks, these responses do not seem to have much of an effect on firm productivity. The authors conclude by listing factors that affect the formation and survival of cooperatives in this and other industries.",,10.1177/001979399905200307,

In credit cooperative field, the presence of a gender diversity can qualify among the mutual aims and social sector should pursue. With reference to cooperative banks, the work aims to verify whether board gender diversity increases the creation of value for stakeholders, in terms of stakeholders global value added (shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, community and external environment). Design/methodology/approach - We propose an econometric approach based on OLS regression model; the econometric model adopted to test our research hypothesis take into account three dependent variables in order to measure the amount and the distribution of value created by each cooperative bank, like Global Value Added Index, HHI Index and GINI Index. Regarding the regressors in order to express the bank governance profile, the choice of variables is based on the results of the studies relating to bank governance-performance. Our model takes also into account other macro-economic control regressors. The model is tested on a sample of Italian cooperative banks. Originality/value - Previous studies on board gender diversity in cooperative banks are particularly limited as a result of limited information and opacity of this field. The existing studies are limited to analyses of the effects on performance of the separation between ownership and control or of the corporate and governance structures, neglecting the dynamics of gender diversity; recently, some authors have investigated the relationship between the composition of loan portfolios and the structure and membership of the boards of cooperative banks in Spain, without however considering the board gender diversity. Our work allows you to expand the knowledge on the issue of governance of cooperative banks. Our study proposes some indicators to assess the social and mutual performance of cooperative banks; it puts in evidence if board gender diversity may improve the amount and also the equity distribution of the value creation process to stakeholders' cooperative banks. Practical implications - The outcomes of the paper may indicate possible best practices with respect to bank governance in bad economic times. So the gender diversity in board cooperative bank may contribute to support better business performance and, specifically, the bank's ability to create and distribute finance customers characterized by a lower credit risk. Based on these results, some managerial implications are proposed.",,10.1108/JFRA-10-2020-0305,Sustainability reporting; Integrated reporting; Corporate reporting; Institutional theory; Agency theory

Design/methodology/approach The study uses a panel data set of 419 firm-year observations of listed companies in Kenya covering the period 2010 through 2018. Data are collected from the annual reports and analysed using a generalized estimations equation model. Findings The results reveal that there is momentum towards newer reporting frameworks in Kenya with substantial IR and SR disclosures in their annual reports. The results also show that level of SR and IR disclosures is influenced by both agency-related factors (board gender diversity, audit committee independence, block ownership and the presence of foreign ownership). Additionally, institutional-related factors (regulatory pressure and promotional efforts of regulatory and professional bodies [reporting excellence awards]) influence the disclosures. Practical implications The results highlight that initiatives such as those led by the regulatory and professional bodies in Kenya are effective in motivating companies to enhance disclosures. Thus, regulators and professional bodies might need to continue and even intensify their efforts. These results have implications for further research as they show that SR and IR disclosures are influenced by similar factors. Social implications The study has the potential to contribute to the ongoing initiatives and discussions on the adoption of IR by firms in Africa as spearheaded by the African Integrated Reporting Council. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge, the study is, perhaps, the first to examine both SR and IR disclosures at the same study allowing comparison of the extent and drivers of the two disclosures. Moreover, examining the institutional-related factors in a single country has not been done in prior literature, and so this is an innovation.",,,Cooperative; Gender; Integration; Women; KUSCCO

In Africa, as elsewhere, inequalities persist between women and men in terms of access to and control over resources and opportunities. ILO provided insight into the inequality in unemployment based on gender. In employment, women are found more often than men in informal and precarious work, with particularly pronounced imbalances in some sectors (ILO, Geneva 2002). The critical importance of closing gender gaps - which are not only contrary to the realization of women's rights, but also an obstacle to poverty reduction - is widely recognized. The report on the State of Food and Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) shows, for instance, that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase farm yields by 20-30 per cent, raising total agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5-4 per cent, which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17 per cent (FAO, Rome 2011). For women, who due to gender-based norms often have lower access to and control over economic and social resources and opportunities, cooperatives present distinct advantages. According to Argawal, women participation in cooperatives has its own advantages. Apart from being able to access economies of scale as providers of services, producers or as consumers, participating in a cooperative as a member, elected leader or manager also brings with it enhanced status and voice in the community and society in general (Argawal 2001). Given that there is insufficient research data on gender issues in Cooperatives, and in particular the participation of women in Leadership roles, KUSCCO in collaboration with the Cooperative University of Kenya conducted an qualitative empirical research that focused on co-operatives under the umbrella of the Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives (KUSCCO) and explored initiatives that KUSCCO has put in place in promoting gender integration in them and recommended strategies for enhancing gender balance.",,10.5209/REVE.84396,Bankmpt; credit cooperatives; Credit risk; Developing countries; Financial risk; Microfinance; Saving

Peruvian Saving and Credit Cooperatives seem to promise investors high rates with comparably low credit risk. Peni is one of the most developed countries in Latin America as far as the cooperative sector is concerned and an attractive one as those institutions are expected to repay very much above market rates. The value of this paper lies in evaluating whether high return rates are justified by a proportionally high credit risk, or otherwise. This research describes the characteristics of the Peruvian Saving and Credit Cooperative market and highlights the safeguarding tools used to protect their associates from credit risk. The paper uses official 2007-2018 data for all 143 Pemvian cooperatives supervised by the financial authority and applies several methodologies widely accepted by academics and practitioners to assess credit risk of the whole sector, namely a production of financial ratios, analysis of the financial statements. Beaver's model. Bathory model, Z-Score. Sprmgate analysis, Logit analysis and H-Factor model. It finds that risk in the industry compares favourably to returns, so highlighting the existence of a market anomaly. Indeed, Peruvian Saving and Credit Cooperatives offer up to two-digit passive interest rates to depositors while the corresponding risk has been computed in this paper as being comparably low. The cooperatives do not display risk of bankmpt under any of the tools used for carrying out the analysis. © 2022 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

A multi-stage stratified sampling procedure was used to collect data through structured questionnaires (including both open-ended and closed questions). A sample of 561 rice farmers drawn from the Eastern and Western provinces of Rwanda was used. The study used an instrumental variable to estimate the causal impacts of womens empowerment, and controlled for the potential endogeneity of the same. The findings of the study showed that womens empowerment has a positive impact on rice yield and income. Overall, the study results call for policy interventions promoting female participation in financial inclusion mechanisms, farmers cooperatives, and agricultural production decisions. In addition, the results highlighted the importance of building strategies and mechanisms for increasing womens control and decisions over assets. The study makes contributions to the empirical literature on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as achieving gender equality, womens empowerment, and food security in developing countries.

Relying on a rich dataset of mainly farmers cooperatives, the study evaluates the socio-economic, ecological and governance outcomes of local cooperative production practices in two nature parks. Results indicate that local cooperatives modify traditional agricultural strategies to promote production systems that respect natural environmental processes and improve local competitive advantage. Their actions promote an inter-community network for conserving land and aquatic biodiversity, even though transitioning to organic production remains challenging for the cooperatives. The paper concludes that the adoption of organic production would distinguish nature parks from other biodiversity-rich local areas. As such, continuous and comprehensive policy actions from nature park authorities, such as dedicated training courses and financial incentives, are required to increase the adoption of organic production. © 2022, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The paper used random sampling technique to select respondents and questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents. Cross-sectional data collected from 98 rice processors were analysed using descriptive statistics and multivariate probit regression model. The results indicated that majority of the rice processors perceived prolonged dry season and increased rainfall intensity as the main climate risks in the state. Livelihood diversification, storing of paddy, and reliance on climate information were the major adaptation strategies used by the rice processors to manage the climate risks. The main determinants of climate change adaptation strategies of rice processors were education, membership of cooperative societies, income, training on rice processing and climate risk management, experience of climate hazards, and ownership of assets. The processors faced various barriers to adoption which are mainly related to capital needs, competition from foreign brands, access to basic infrastructure and roads and information, high cost of labour.

This study examines the relationships between cooperative board diversity (i.e., value and functional) and three performance variables (social performance, operational performance, and democratic performance). Additionally, we hypothesize that conflict (task or relational) mediates these relationships. We argue that decision making, policy, and performance depend on the composition of a board. The empirical analysis, using a sample of 423 female board members in 66 local consumer cooperatives in South Korea, finds that board value diversity can have a negative effect on performance, even though their functional background diversity may be positive, while conflicts over performing tasks may mediate functional background diversity and performance. More specifically, the results indicate that board value diversity is positive and significantly related to relational conflicts, while functional background diversity is negative and significantly related to task conflicts. The findings suggest that performance of cooperatives can be improved with more diverse board with functional backgrounds. We hope that this paper could offer a significant contribution to both the board and corporate governance literature and the diversity literature. © The authors, 2022.",,10.37075/EA.2022.2.04,business activity; economic development; environmental economic; investments partnership; nature reserve fund

JCM involves three types of actor: landowners, cooperatives and the people who cultivate the land, who may or may not be landowners or members of the cooperative. Implementation of this strategy, which is being adopted by an increasing number of agri-food marketing cooperatives, requires substantial social capital. Therefore, collaboration between public and private actors is needed to generate and transfer knowledge on these initiatives. The Operational Group on Social Innovation in Land Management (GO_InnoLand) was created in 2020 to support JCM processes, which help young farmers who are setting up in the agricultural sector.

Drawing upon qualitative and statistical analysis, this study examines the establishment of credit unions across indigenous villages in Taiwan, where both of these traditional authority structures are present. The analysis shows that villages characterized by ascribed power and inherited hierarchy (chief villages) provide less structural support for the founding and operation of credit unions and are less likely to adopt credit unions than communities whose leadership is determined by individual merits and achievement (big man villages). This finding suggests that existing authority structures in these traditional societies constrain incentive schemes and trust structures critical to the founding and persistence of new economic organizations. © 2022 Editions Ophrys.

However, agricultural service cooperatives are not developed in Ukraine. The purpose of this study was to find the main drivers of agricultural service cooperatives development in Ukraine, to outline on this basis promising directions for development of agricultural policy in terms of stimulating their development as a counterweight to the dominance of agricultural holdings. It is proven that the main restraining factor in the development of agricultural service cooperatives in Ukraine is institutional memory of a peasant, which was formed during collectivization in Soviet times and which in modern conditions is associated with the concept of cooperative. This creates opposition from agricultural producers towards the national policy on the development of agricultural cooperatives, which meet international cooperative principles, and which have proven their advantages in increasing competitiveness of farmers on the example of developed countries of the world. It is emphasized that before changing formal institutions through legislation, it is necessary to form proper informal institutions that will strengthen, and not oppose, the introduction of formal ones.

However, the cooperative movement is changing this phenomenon, and has attracted the attention of national government and international donors to support the re-establishment of new farmers groups. Using cross-sectional data collected from 37 cooperatives, this paper analyses the factors influencing the success of donor supported agricultural cooperatives by ordinal logistic regression model. The results indicate that new groups are rather small but homogeneous. Members agreed that more non-economic, rather than economic, benefits are currently derived from collective action. Determinants of success include the size of the cooperative, the proportion of women in the cooperative, the proportion of nuclear families, active participation in the cooperative and the type of product cultivated. However, the results are conditioned by respective value chain and influenced by the strategies of non-governmental organizations during the establishment of cooperatives. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).",,10.1590/1808-057x202114660,Informal controls; Job satisfaction; Management controls; Psychological empowerment

Despite previous studies having analyzed the role of certain management control systems in individual results, such as psychological empowerment and job satisfaction, the evidence on informal controls within this context is inconclusive. Credit union systems play a considerable role in economic growth, regional development, and employability. We therefore explore the perception of directors and managers of business units of one of the biggest cooperative systems regarding the informal controls used. Considering that job satisfaction has a series of implications for organizations (for example in employee loyalty and job performance), it is important to understand its determinants. The literature points to the growing concern among contemporary organizations about informal controls. Various studies focus on understanding the role of these controls and their respective effects on organizational and individual behaviors. From the individual perspective, there is a need to analyze the indirect effects of management controls on individual aspects by means of psychological variables. Thus, this study provides new evidence on informal controls in organizations by exploring the intervening role of psychological empowerment and the (beneficial) effects on job satisfaction. In addition, the study provides a methodological contribution to the national research on management control by adding an analysis based on mixed methods. A survey was applied to directors and managers of business units of one of the biggest credit union systems in Brazil. The data were analyzed using a mixed methods approach: Partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Informal controls are directly and indirectly associated (via empowerment) with job satisfaction. Moreover, the findings indicate more than one solution for high job satisfaction. © 2022 Universidade de Sao Paulo.

Despite ongoing financial support from various government agencies, many of the countrys rice cooperatives struggle to remain viable. Cooperative failure is often attributed to poor management, inadequate capital, and opportunistic side selling by members. However, a growing body of literature views these problems as symptoms of much more fundamental flaws in the institutional arrangements that characterize traditional cooperatives. Relationships between indicators of financial performance and institutional attributes observed in case studies of four Philippine rice farmer cooperatives were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of this analysis were interpreted against causal relationships predicted by the New Institutional Economics theory. Financial performance improves when cooperatives require their members to invest in proportion to their patronage, allow members to adjust their shareholding, and periodically redeem members shares. Other performance-enhancing institutional arrangements could be adopted if the Philippine Cooperative Code authorized directors to issue class B shares. The findings also highlight operational and governance practices that improve financial performance, which directors can and should apply. © 2022, Asian Economic and Social Society.

It is also lifeblood of the majority of the farmers in Arba Minch district of Ethiopia. However, this sector is experiencing many constraints with limited investment on sustainable value chain management. Thus, this study aims to examine the sustainability performance assessment of the banana value chain by comparing and analyzing 25 attributes through triple bottom-line indicators. The critical aspects of the qualitative data were analyzed using Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems version 3.0 at Ethiopian context. The results show that banana product flow from the farmer and ends with the consumer through three market channels which link farmers directly with rural retailers, traveling traders, and farmer cooperatives. Largest volume of banana was sold through the traveling trader channel while the smallest volume was sold via the rural retailer channels. The banana payment flow begins from consumers and ends with input suppliers. Farmers have limited access to alternative markets for their banana products, but wholesalers have many connections and marketing options across the country. The results of the banana value chain sustainability assessment also reveal that the economic, social, and environmental indicators have moderate sustainability performance in the study area. The value of the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.7993 which shows that the five-point scale items of the experts judgment on the sustainability of banana value chain are consistent and reliable. The chain has several advantages in terms of profitability, emission of air pollutants, employment, and constraints in terms of coordination, profit margin, value share, market diversity, transportation, product and market information, safety and hygiene, and waste management. Thus, Government and non-governmental organizations give due attention towards the sustainable banana value chain. © 2022 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.03.002,China; Hexi corridor; Jinchang city; Left-behind response; Rural development pressure; Type identification; Three-stay population

This paper builds an evaluation model of rural development pressure and left-behind to analyze the spatial differences and characteristics of rural development pressure and the three-stay problem in Jinchang City, Hexi Corridor, China, in 2019. Then, we explored the relationship between them. The conclusions are: (1) Jinchang City has the lowest pressure on infrastructure and the largest pressure on industrial development, with significant spatial differences in comprehensive pressure. (2) Jinchang City is dominated by double pressure villages (40.60%) and comprehensive pressure villages (38.35%). Single-pressure villages (19.55%) and non-pressure villages (1.50%) account for relatively small proportions. (3) The population of three-stay in Jinchang City is 1,642, accounting for 1.19% of the total rural population. The middle and low-level left-behind areas have the largest number, accounting for 76.69% of the total administrative villages. The types of left-behind villages are mainly dominated by left-behind children and left-behind elderly people, accounting for 71.72% of the total number of left-behind villages. (4) Homestead per household, the rate of network coverage, per capita cultivated land area, and the number of specialized farmer cooperatives owned are the main factors affecting different types of left-behind villages, and each factor has different effects on different types of left-behind villages.

We present research conducted through site visits, participant observation, focus groups, and surveys of communities affiliated with the Delta EATS public school garden program currently operating in three Mississippi public elementary schools. Our findings demonstrate low levels of food sovereignty but high levels of agency and ingenuity in accessing and obtaining desired foods, along with abundant interest in preserving and passing on traditional foodways. Community members express the desire to exert greater local control over food production, distribution, and consumption through community gardens, farmers markets, and cooking and food preservation classes. While food sovereignty is constrained by the current agri-food system of the Delta, programs such as Delta EATS and farmers cooperatives are enhancing local food sovereignty through farm-to-school programs that strengthen relationships between farmers and the community. © 2022 by the Authors.",,10.4067/s0718-88702022000100075,credit; Credit unions; financial inclusion

,cooperative militarization: agricultural reform and the u.s. occupation of okinawa,Lai S.,Pacific Historical Review,308684,91,1,33-65,2022,University of California Press,,"The use of EU-approved pesticides is low in Ondo State, especially among smallholder cocoa farmers. Perhaps, trade credit, being one of the most important sources of credit, would increase the use of EU-approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers. Therefore, this study investigated access to trade credit and its impact on the use of EU-approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers in Ondo State. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 240 smallholder cocoa farmers for the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a double hurdle regression model, and an endogenous switching probit regression model. The descriptive results showed that on average, respondents were 44 years of age, 16 years of farming experience, 7 people for household size, and 2.70 hectares for farm size. Most of the respondents obtain trade credit from their respective farmers' cooperatives (82%), while others obtain trade credit from input suppliers (73%) and cocoa exporters (66%). It was also noted that only 35% (84/240) of the smallholder cocoa farmers use EU-approved pesticides on their cocoa farms. A majority (73.4%) of the respondents used the Ridomin 66WP gold (Cuprous Oxide + metalaxyl-M). Others use Esiom 150SL (Acetamiprid) (37.5%), Funguran-OH (Copper hydroxide) (49.1%), touch down fort (Glyphosate) (47.5%), and Actara 25WG (Thiamethoxan) (25%). The result further showed that age, gender, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and assets significantly influenced the probability of a farmer receiving trade credit. However, gender, household size, year of farming experience, cooperative membership, and assets are statistically significant in determining the amount of trade credit obtained by the farmers. The first stage of the ESPM revealed that gender, age, household size, farm size, and cooperative membership significantly influence the smallholder cocoa farmers' access to trade credit. While the second stage of the ESPM revealed that significant use of EU-approved pesticides among users of trade credit is affected by age, household size, education, access to extension services, and cooperative membership. Meanwhile, among non-users of trade credit, variables such as age, farming experience, farm size, land ownership, and cooperative membership significantly affect the use of EU-approved pesticides. After controlling for observed and unobserved covariates, the study concluded that access to trade credit positively impacts the use of EU- approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers. It was concluded that policy strategies aimed at increasing the use of EU-approved pesticides among small cocoa farmers should take into account trade credit. © 2022 The Author(s)",,10.1525/phr.2022.91.1.33,Agriculture; Colonization; Economic development; Okinawa; U.S. empire; U.S. military
,are collective trading organisations necessarily inclusive of smallholder farmers?: a comparative analysis of farmer-led auctions in the javanese chilli market,Untari D.W.; Vellema S.,Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics,11877863,35,4,-,2022,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,"In 1951, six years after the United States defeated Japan and commenced the Occupation of Okinawa, the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus (USCAR) issued an ordinance in support of agricultural cooperatives. Despite the appearance of altruism, the move marked the emergence of the U.S. anticolonial empire, a form that advocated racial and ethnic self-determination even as it expanded the U.S. military presence. This article shows how U.S. policymakers in Okinawa borrowed from modernization theory to implement models to foster ethnic identification through economic development. Their plans sought to render the United States an ally to Okinawa freedom despite the devastating effects militarism had on the local landscape. Specifically, military plans posited frameworks like the Okinawan economy, which strategically turned the military into a partner without whom Okinawa could not modernize. The article further focuses on agriculture, an arena where the contradictions of the U.S. Occupation was most acute. It argues that rehabilitating the local cooperative network drew Okinawans into the military project, not only to paper over the U.S. colonial presence, but also to further the reach of military discipline. © 2022 by the Pacific Coast Branch, American Historical Association.

,"a nexus between farmland rights, and access, demand, and amount of agricultural loan under the socialist system of china",Gong M.; Elahi E.,Land Use Policy,2648377,120,,-,2022,Elsevier Ltd,,"Organising smallholder farmers into groups or co-operatives is widely promoted as a strategy to connect farmers to markets and turn them into price makers rather than price takers. This pathway usually combines co-operative organisational models, based on collective ownership and representation in internal governance, with measures to shorten the agri-food chain, shifting the ownership of intermediary sourcing, aggregating and trading functions to the group. The underlying assumption is that this improves smallholder farmers' terms of inclusion in markets. To scrutinise this assumption, our study compares two examples of farmer-led auctions facilitating trading in the chilli market in Java, Indonesia. The auctions' ownership, management and performance evolved differently: one was run by a group and the other by a family. The comparison brings nuance to the prevalent emphasis on co-operative ownership structures. By researching practices central to collective trading at the chilli suppliertrader interface, this study unravels four dimensionsownership, voice, reward and riskcapturing smallholder chilli farmers' terms of inclusion in both the auctions and the market. Our comparative analysis suggests that shared ownership and control of the trading function, a central feature of co-operative models, does not necessarily ensure favourable terms of inclusion for smallholder farmers with little capacity to take risks. The capacity to reconfigure the terms of market inclusion for vulnerable smallholder farmers involves direct payment modalities and risk taking. A collectively owned trading organisation does not necessarily imply an inclusive business concept when the organisation cannot acquire sufficient working capital to pay its suppliers. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106279,Agricultural loan; China; Farmland rights; Land transfer; Propensity score matching method; Sobel test

Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the impact of farmland rights and land transfer on access, demand, and amount of agricultural loan under the socialist system of China. For this purpose, data from China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) were used to empirically analyze the objectives of the study using various econometric approaches particularly, the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method and Benchmark regression. Results depicted that farmland rights and land transfer-in positively and significantly impacted access, demand, and amount of loan. However, the land transfer-out reduced the demand for agricultural loan. Moreover, the land transfer-in found a positive mediating impact on access, demand, and amount of agricultural loan. While the negative mediating effect of the land transfer-out was only reflected in the access and demand for agricultural loan. The farm output of the previous year significantly and positively impacted availing the agricultural loan. While the age of farmers significantly and negatively impacted on availing the agricultural loan. The results also confirmed the regional differences regarding the impact of farmland rights and land transfer-out on availing the agricultural loan.

Theoretical framework: The study absorbed previous studies and expert opinions to determine the member' satisfaction coming to high-tech agricultural cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data was collected through a direct survey of 395 members participating in high-tech agricultural cooperatives. Then, the study uses the method of partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis and assess the satisfaction level of the members. Finding: The research results show that the factors affecting the satisfaction of cooperative members include 7 factors: working environment, trust, managers, level of participation, perceived benefits, support policies, and service capacity. Research, Practical & Social Implication: Based on the results of this study, several solutions to improve the current association activities with the role of the cooperative model as the core are proposed. People are encouraged to participate more in the association by improving the management skills of cooperatives, strengthening support activities, creating jobs, and raising incomes for people. Originality/value: Members' satisfaction will promote the activities of linking production and consumption with the main role of the cooperative, not just stopping at the immediate propaganda activities. Since then, these activities also improve people's confidence when participating in the association.

Therefore, the level of risk of participation of bank and non-bank financial intermediaries in such schemes is assessed as high. The lack of a practical methodology for assessing the development trajectory of financial intermediaries raises the question of the need for preventive control and quality modeling of their growth dynamics. The study aims to identify and formalize the patterns of development paths of banking and non-banking financial intermediaries based on the Harrington desirability function, which will be used to identify risk patterns as indicative patterns of financial intermediaries' participation in shadow schemes. The sample includes 13 banking institutions, 3 credit unions, 3 pawnshops, 3 insurance companies, and 3 financial companies. The obtained results showed the relationship between the financial intermediary risk level in terms of its participation in shadow schemes and the phases of the economic cycle as a catalyst for the economic dynamics of the formal and informal economy. Thus, in 2012-2015, most financial intermediaries were in the zone of most significant risk, especially banks, characterized by economic, social, and political instability. Today, banks are in the group with a controlled level of risk of participation in scheme operations. Over the years analyzed, a stable neutral level of risk of participation in shadow schemes was inherent in most non-bank financial institutions. They were less sensitive than banks to the phases of the economic cycle. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

We employ ordered and multinomial logit models to investigate whether abnormal positive bank spreadsreflecting rates that could offer few advantages to members and large private benefits to directorsincrease the probability of transformation. Our results indicate that the expectations of members and directors explain credit unions transformation, as seen in size and performance. The evidence reinforces that, under expectations of gains, members and directors play an active role in the decision to transform the ownership structure of credit unions, suggesting improvements in the corporate governance and incentives for mergers so that credit unions can grow to benefit members. © 2022 FUCAPE Business School.

,post-harvest losses of crops and its determinants in ethiopia: tobit model analysis,Debebe S.,Agriculture and Food Security,20487010,11,1,-,2022,BioMed Central Ltd,,"While Ostrom-inspired research has proven an important corrective to the simplistic markets or government dichotomy that continues to shape social and administrative sciences, this paper uses a case study to suggest that in some circumstances, our understanding of the commons could be enriched by giving more weight to the role governments can play in helping to constitute a human-made commons. In particular, this paper examines the case of a little-known deposit insurance scheme run by credit unions in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that has operated without once incurring a deficit for 70 years despite offering the kind of unlimited deposit insurance frowned upon by policymakers. We find that the provincial government played an important role in constituting the scheme and helping it operate, effectively, as a polycentric commons that until recently, satisfied all the design principles that tend to characterize successful collective management. The resulting argument is simple: it would be difficult to understand the stability of Saskatchewans credit union deposit insurance scheme without also understanding how government supported its operation as a commons. © 2022 The Author(s).",,10.1186/s40066-022-00357-6,Determinants; Ethiopia; Post-harvest losses of crops; Tobit model

However, a lack of knowledge on the extent of post-harvest losses and its associated impeding factors are posing major challenges to effectiveness of grain post-harvest loss management strategy and to scale up for all other crop types in Ethiopia. The study estimates the magnitude of post-harvest losses of all crops and identifies its determinants. Methodology: A national-level agriculture survey data were obtained from the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Tobit model analysis techniques. Results: The analysis shows 25.81% perceived annual average post-harvest losses of crops were obtained with considerable variation across the crop types. The main factors impeding post-harvest losses of crops were households with larger adult family size, higher levels of education attendance, and wealth status, large landholding size and damage of stored crops by insect pests infestation and/or rodent feeding due to utilization of traditional storage equipments, access to extension support services, cooperative marketing membership, and being far away from both all weathered roads and near local market centers due to a higher transaction costs associated with a lack of market information, contamination, and mechanical injuries. Conclusion: Minimization of post-harvest losses of crops could be achieved through a holistic approach by providing short and long-term training on post-harvest management practices, promoting the use of post-harvest technologies, paying special attention to the institutional support systems (agriculture extension and rural credit services), strengthening the support for post-harvest handling technologies, reinforcing the existing farmer cooperative marketing, and improvements of the local market and road networking infrastructures of rural areas should be undertaken by the government in collaboration with non-government organizations. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1111/issj.12366,

However, Greek agricultural cooperatives are usually small and characterised by low levels of processing facilities, technical skills and marketing expertise. One of the most emblematic products that these coops produce is olive oil, a product of widely recognised nutritional value, unique health benefits and increasing global demand. Approximately one-quarter of the country's 300 thousand tone production comes from the island of Crete. The goal of this study was to map the olive-oil producing cooperatives of Crete and examine the extent of their inter-cooperation and the barriers they encounter. In addition to being a key cooperative principle, cooperation among cooperatives can create new sales channels, lead to significant cost reductions, better profit margins, increased bargaining power and knowledge exchange.

The relations with the workers, the remuneration of the partners contribution and the way in which the results are distributed configure them as companies of a deep social nature, even though they also have a commercial nature. After reviewing the contents of the studies aimed at the identification of business failure prediction models, we have observed that there are still very few which address cooperative societies, despite the importance of this kind of organization in our business landscape. In addition, most of the papers follow traditional statistical methodologies. In fact, the different methodologies used in this field of research have evolved over time; and one of the newest and most innovative is Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which to the best of our knowledge has not been applied in this research area. The objective of this study is to show the usefulness of Extreme Gradient Boosting methodology, which is based on machine learning techniques, in the prediction of business failure, particularly in the field of cooperative companies. We will determine whether the algorithm is suitable for the identification of the most relevant variables that indicate situations of financial distress. Therefore, it will allow to classify a company as failed or not failed. We will also analyze whether this technique is appropriate to explain the reasons leading to this classification. We also intend to contribute to overcoming the general absence in the literature of this type of studies in this business environment and to incorporate modern techniques based on artificial intelligence. To achieve the aims of the study, a model has been estimated from a sample of non-financial cooperatives that failed in 2015, belonging to various productive sectors. To consider a company as failed, a broad definition of failure has been chosen, because it allows us to clearly distinguish between failed and non-failed companies. Thus, the failure has been identified to the legal definition of insolvency, as contemplated by the present Spanish insolvency regulation. The selection made, taking into account this condition, consisted in 56 companies that had filed insolvency proceedings in the year considered. Thereafter, they have been paired with as many non-failed ones with similar characteristics, so that the final sample has consisted of 112 companies. Since our main goal is to formulate business failure prediction models, we have focused on those variables or financial ratios that provide information on aspects of the firms solvency and profitability, but without forgetting the influence of the companys debts. To these main cate gories, we have added rotation, activity and asset structure. Given the uniqueness of this kind of companies we are considering, some clarifications have been made for some of the selected financial ratios, specifically for the debt and profitability ratios. Results from the statistical study show the importance of the variables related to solvency, liquidity, debt and profitability. These variables exhibited the most contribution to detecting a situation of business failure. The model combines in an effective way the variables of long-term solvency, liquidity, activity, and debt, and achieves a 100% accuracy rate in the training sample and 86% in an independent testing sample. The results have confirmed the higher the solvency and immediate liquidity of a cooperative company the lower the probability of failure. Additionally, the higher the variable that measures the ratio value added to sales the higher the probability of failure, as financial and personnel expenses are involved in this relationship. Finally, we have observed that profitability increases when cash flow grows in proportion to the companys assets, therefore being consistent in the sense that as a company performs better the propensity for failure is reduced by being more profitable. These results are consistent with the empirical evidence: the higher the solvency and profitability rates the lower the failure probability, and the lower the debts the lower the exposure to failure. Consequently, we understand that the applied technique is quite effective for the objectives pursued, that is, the early detection of business failure for cooperative companies. Probably the variable less easy to compare is profitability since in a cooperative the book result is not comparable with the rest of commercial companies because it does not take into account the potential benefits of their partners through prices of cooperative products and services. The resulting model, in addition to classifying cooperative as failed and non-failed, has shown its potential to identify the underlying reasons for this classification. That is, the XGBoost model algorithm provides explanations about the variables weights in terms of failure probability for each observation of the test sample, splitting the individual weight and the influence sign of each of the predictors. Therefore, the final model is not only about high accuracy predictions, but also leads to results that are fully interpretableit is possible to determine the sign and the effect of each variable or financial ratio on the final prediction for each and every one of the observations. The study is intended to be of a continuity nature because we consider it would be very interesting to carry out this type of analysis again but extending it to a series of several years in order to propose a model capable of detecting failure with a few years in advance. In short, we have demonstrated that this study contributes to the literature on business failure in the cooperative sector by means of showing the utility of a new methodology (XGBoost) capable of identifying cooperatives with a high probability of failure. The results are very accurate, and their interpretation is very easy. © 2021 CIRIEC-España",,10.1017/bap.2021.10,Agriculture; Australia; Co-operatives; Demutualization; Neo-Liberalism

This fueled an externally and internally driven push to demutualize co-operatives and convert them into Investor Owned Businesses (IOB). While the international trend to demutualize emerged from the end of the Second World War, evidence indicates it accelerated from the late 1980s until the onset of the Global Financial Crisis. Drawing on an ongoing project of historical data collection and visual analysis of Australian co-operatives, this paper explores the Australian experience with demutualization, particularly with regard to agriculture. In line with the international experience, there has been a surge in Australian demutualization since the 1980s. However, while demutualization continues to be a feature of the Australian landscape post-GFC as co-operatives tackle with the changed political and economic environment, the paper also challenges the view that demutualization is inevitable for agricultural co-operatives. Co-operative managers can make strategic choices to avoid demutualization and retain member control. Further, co-operative culture and the persistence of co-operative clusters in particular regions can blunt the push to demutualize.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Therefore, this research aimed to identify opportunities for creating value by internalizing flows in the production of silk cocoons by promoting a circular bioeconomy. To that end, a tool was used to assess the circularity of the referred system. The current circularity of the production of silk cocoons, at the farm level, is 74.19 % for material, and 0 % for energy. A range of measures are proposed, based on (i) engaging with reverse logistics practices, (ii) establishing a local agroindustrial cooperative, and (iii) building community biodigesters, which aid a potential circularity of 85.51 % (material), and 100 % (energy) at the farm level, and 98.42 % (material) and 100 % (energy), at the cooperative level. On top of increasing circular value, the proposed measures might bring environmental benefits, such as lessening environmental impacts of logistics (by valuing local resources) and replacing non-renewable energy, and social impacts, through increased quality of life for sericulturists. Economic implications need further investigation and are suggested to be addressed in future research endeavors, along with policy implications for the development of a circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, an increased circularity can also contribute to a few of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations, such as SDGs 2, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,10.18461/ijfsd.v13i2.B1,agricultural policy; cooperative demise; cooperative life cycle; hybrid cooperative; traditional cooperative

Interviews with the project members, ex-members, extension officers and youth were conducted through a semi-structured questionnaire administered in IsiXhosa. According to the results, lack of intensive production resulting in very low incomes is one of the reasons why projects such as ZFSC fail to attract young people and provide employment for rural people. Agricultural extension advisory services play a very limited role because of their generalist approach; they lack depth of knowledge about diverse agricultural subject areas.

Against this background, the e-commerce has played an important role in solving this problem. Therefore, it has once again become the focus of attention of the Chinese government and researchers. The co-operative is an important channel for Chinese farmers to sell agricultural products, and thus, it is a vital research issue to discuss whether the application of e-commerce in the co-operative is conducive to the improvement of its profitability. This study therefore uses Logit model to analyze the factors affecting the use of e-commerce in co-operatives and PSM model to calculate the impact of e-commerce on the profit margin of co-operatives. The following conclusions can thus be drawn: (1) The gender and education level of decision-makers and the degree of processing and relevant certification of products are important influencing factors, (2) e-commerce can significantly improve the profit margin of co-operatives, and (3) e-commerce plays a more significant role in improving the profit margin of co-operatives selling primary processed products.

This paper studies the locational strategy for recycling facilities of end-of-life PV modules from the perspective of various stakeholders with a case in Zhejiang province, one of the leading regions in promoting distributed photovoltaic applications in China. The generation of end-of-life modules in the Million Household Rooftop PV Project in Zhejiang Province is estimated from 2041 to 2045. The regional reverse logistics network for collection of the retired PV modules is optimized using the Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) model. The article draws on the PV recycling scheme of PV CYCLE in Europe, and proposes the following two scenarios for comparison: (1) Scenario A: Municipal recycling, in which the local government takes the responsibility to establish the collection and recycling infrastructures; and (2) Scenario B: Producer cooperative recycling under Extended Producer Responsibility scheme, in which the PV producers use their sales and customer services network to help collecting the end-of-life PV modules. The different roles of the stakeholders affect the overall locational strategy for recycling. The result shows that: (1) Both scenarios result in similar path of the utility of recycling facilities: when only one recycling facility is needed in 2041, the recycling plant in Hangzhou will be used to minimize the overall transportation cost for the whole province; while more facilities are needed due to increasing generation of end-of-life modules in the next 4 years, regional collection centers will be assigned to the nearest recycling facility, dividing the province into three regional recycling group: North Group (including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou), South Group (including Jinhua, Lishui, and Quzhou), and the Coastal Group (including Wenzhou and Taizhou). (2) Although the overall cost of reverse logistic in scenario B is slightly higher than scenario A at the beginning in 2041, integrating the producer's sales and service network into the collection network can significantly lower the overall reverse logistics cost up to 9.7 percent at the end of the 2043 when the waste PV generation achieves 72 thousand ton/year. The conclusion suggests the necessity to introduce the Extended Producer Responsibility principle in Chinese PV market to encourage the industry to participate in the construction of an efficient recycling system for the coming wave of end-of-life PV modules. © 2021",,10.3390/su13031494,Breeding programs; Farm animal genetic resources; Governance; Sustainability

Community-based livestock breeding programs (CBBPs) have emerged as a potential approach to implement breeding programs in smallholder farms. This study assesses the viability of CBBPs as a potential approach for conservation and improvement of indigenous small ruminants, using case studies of goat CBBPs in Malawi and Uganda. Data were collected using focus group discussions, personal interviews, and direct observations. The program promotes and empowers smallholders to have access to small ruminant feed resources through the protection of existing communal pasturelands, capacity building in pasture production, and conservation of crop residues and crop by-products. Implementation of the CBBP enhances the contributions through improved animal growth performance, kids survival, and twinning rates leading to increased offtake rates and better prices. The existence of permanently established supporting organizations and other stakeholders provides sustainable institutional support instrumental for the establishment and growth of CBBPs. However, the establishment of functional community-based institutions (producer cooperatives) and investments in institutional/policy reforms to safeguard fair trading, access to common resources by small ruminant keepers, and adoption of the CBBP model into national livestock development programs are some of the key milestones that can guarantee sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

However, these co-operatives have also encountered their own technical and financial performance issues. This study asks whether a co-operatives board capital (i.e., human capital and social capital) can positively influence that co-operatives organizational performance via the mediating role of organizational capital (i.e., structural capital and financial capital). Data were collected from 133 co-operatives in several regions in Thailand, with the population sample comprising 133 managers and 529 employees of Thai co-operative businesses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of aggregated employee data (n = 529 [board capital]) and organizational-level data (n = 133 [organizational capital and organizational performance]) provided full support for the proposed hypotheses (X2/df = 1.827, RMSEA =.079, CFI = 0.911, TLI = 0.901, SRMR = 0.053). In particular, the board capital of the co-operatives was found to positively influence organizational performance via the mediating role of organizational capital. Furthermore, the results showed that agricultural co-operatives were rated significantly lower in terms of their board capital and organizational performance in comparison to non-agricultural co-operatives. These findings highlight the importance of different types of capital and the discrepancies that exist between agricultural and non-agricultural co-operatives, which deserves further attention from researchers © 2022.

As a result, it was found that the contributions of renewable energy from wind sources installed in these regions are still incipient from the perspective of cooperative managers, although they believe that the appropriation of this technology by family farming could contribute significantly to the expansion of food production and market building. © Este é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a licença Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado..

We argue that league ownership structures must balance two types of transaction costs: the costs to league owners of collective decision-making and the costs of contracting with stakeholders of the league, importantly players, owners, and potential investors. We compare the transaction costs of the current team owned league with the alternatives of investor and player owned leagues, finding that each ownership structure reduces some transaction costs while raising others. © The Author(s) 2021.",,10.1590/1806-9479.2021.232252,agroindustry cooperatives; business cooperatives; cooperativas agroindustriais; cooperativas empresariais; cooperative elite; cooperativism; cooperativismo; elite cooperativista; OCEPAR; Paraná; Paraná; Union and Organization of Cooperatives of the State of Paraná

The object is the Union and Organization of Cooperatives of Paraná State (OCEPAR) in the last two decades. The research considered, on one hand, the institutional constraints, external and internal to this entity, and, on the other hand, the social aspects of the members of this elite. In addition to the production of analytical categories able to deal with the particularities of this elite, we used Brazilian legislation on cooperatives, some economic data, documents from OCEPAR and other cooperative entities, and interviews. We found that the institutional aspects of business cooperativism and the social characteristics of this entity's leaders help to explain why presidents of the largest agro-industrial cooperatives occupy the majority of the OCEPAR board constituting a channel of political power between such cooperatives and the entity and the latter with the political institutions and authorities. Therefore, we verify that some institutional and social aspects strongly impact the recruitment of this cooperative elite and the constitution of the agro-industrial cooperativism as a political actor, a dimension of great relevance for addressing its economic importance. © 2022.

This study contributes to maintaining the business linkage model among farmers - cooperatives - enterprises in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic and quickly recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used for data analysis following an iterative process based on theoretical and empirical analyses to obtain a structural model fit and test the research hypothesis. The findings indicate that the VCI positively influenced the VCP of Chu-mango business linkages at the 1% significance level through coordination (Beta = 0.345; construct reliability (CR) = 3.272), collaboration (Beta = 0.289; CR = 3.128), and joint decision-making (Beta = 0.324; CR = 3.245). This study provides empirical data on the relationship between VCI and VCP through the Chu-mango value chain in Dong Thap Province during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness from stakeholders and encourage value chain thinking to improve performance. This result may pave the way for relevant policymakers to look for policies and strategies for better inclusiveness of stakeholders to show the importance of the VCI in improving the performance. Moreover, the study is an empirical case contributing to the agribusiness value chain in a developing country; it applies the agribusiness value chain of the tropical fruit domain and can be used for other agricultural products in other cases of unexpected risks. © 2021.

Long a smallholder dominant economy with small and fragmented farms, a suite of policies, regulations, and financial instruments are being mobilised to drive larger-scale, more commercialised, and more industrialised farming in China. Larger operators such as dragon-head agribusinesses are transforming production and supply chains, while the operational rights and titles over farmland are being formalised so that smallholders can more easily transfer their land to large-scale producers. This article aims to deepen our understanding of the extent and nature of land transfer in China by exploring its dynamics in inland provinces. It draws on a 2019 survey of more than 900 cash-cropping farms in four provinces (Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei and Yunnan), semi-structured interviews, and secondary data. Our mixed methods approach supports in-depth analysis of the extent and dynamics of land transfer in apple, tea, orange and coffee-growing areas. We find that in contrast to national statistics, land transfer from smallholders to other operators is generally quite limited, a finding which highlights the ongoing viability of specialised smallholder farming and other site-specific barriers to scaling up. In the site where land transfer is most extensive, it is being driven by a state-agribusiness-cooperative alliance rather than through a newly emerged rural land market. We also find that the nature of leasing out farmland is markedly different to leasing in farmland. Where it occurs, the leasing out of land tends to be organised and formalised, and is tied to state developmentalist goals, particularly poverty alleviation. The leasing in of land is more widespread and occurs on an informal basis. Our analysis highlights key conditions that determine uneven land transfer and confirms that local political-economic dynamics complicate the realisation of central government directives on the ground. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,10.18461/ijfsd.v13i2.B2,agricultural cooperatives; communication flow; means of communication; members

The authors conducted a systematic literature review to address the following questions: How does communication occur in agricultural cooperatives? What means of communication have been adopted by agricultural cooperatives? What are the main theories supporting the analysis of communication issues in these organizations? There is evidence in the literature that inadequate communication between management and cooperative members can be one of the reasons for organizational failure. Inconsistent and ineffective communication can create a disconnect between members and organizations. In addition, communication is an important mechanism capable of improving the commitment of members to the cooperative. Despite this, agricultural cooperatives are slow to incorporate more diverse and effective means of communication to reach their varied audiences. © 2022.

Our study fills this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of property rights reform on banks capital adequacy in China and heterogeneity across restructured forms of ownership, reform pathways, and time. Using data from rural credit cooperatives in China for 20082014, we find that rural cooperative banks have better capital adequacy than banks under two other forms of ownership. We further find that among four possible reform pathways, only restructuring from a rural cooperative bank to a rural commercial bank enhances capital adequacy significantly and that improvements in capital adequacy generally weaken over time. Further analyses indicate that this improvement is primarily attributable to capital injections and removal of non-performing assets by the government. These findings contribute to an understanding of how best to reform rural finance, particularly in developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.3390/su132212344,Brands; Competitive strategy; Cooperative values; Differentiation; Germany; Social capital; Sustainability; Wine cooperatives

The main purpose of the wine cooperatives is to support the member businesses with the highest possible payouts for their grapes. Wine cooperatives can fulfil this purpose by implementing a differentiation strategy. On the one hand, brands can be used for differentiation. On the other hand, cooperatives can use particular values in the communication with customers that correspond to the target groups values. Based on the definition of the International Co-operative Alliance, cooperatives are a sustainable form of enterprise. Therefore, the question arises whether it is possible to use sustainability as a value that corresponds to cooperatives as a form of enterprise as well as to a strong societal value that gains importance. Which role does social capital play in the context of social sustainability? The aim of this paper is to shed light on the understanding of brands, to show which cooperative-specific characteristics might pose a challenge to cooperatives in terms of brand management and to examine the understanding of the sustainability construct as well as sustainable management practices applied by wine cooperatives to date.

E-Government services are mostly under this discourse with the aim to provide citizen centric services in the public domain. Business and development organizations alike are also investing in developing their own digital infrastructure for rendering services to its stakeholders. This case describes scenario in which a cooperative organization wishes to use digital infrastructure and provide digital services to its farmer members. The cooperative continued investing in ICT since the last couple of decades and constantly upgraded it to ease the transaction and bring efficiency and reduce information asymmetry. This had greatly benefitted the members. However, the cooperative is aware that its communication network built on the wireless medium has its own limitations in introducing new services and integrating its databases and applications. The cooperative took note of Digital India (DI) initiatives to provide digital services to rural areas and build an ecosystem to empower the citizens in its governance set up. This DI policy has implicit provisions of better networking protocols with improved bandwidth. The organization has a dilemma to continue with investing its own resources or explore possibility of piggybacking on the DI initiative. The cooperative wished to examine the total cost of ownership in either case and assess the feasibility of converging with the infrastructure created by the government. Case synopsis: The Government Information Technology Policies are increasingly favouring citizens and in favour of shared infrastructure and services. It is worth the examination to evaluate strategies to deploy IT infrastructure and services with optimized cost and better returns in an enterprise. This is far more important for a social enterprise like AMALSAD cooperative (user-owned firm) that has deployed its own IT infrastructure and ITeS. AMALSAD cooperative deployed its IT assets long back and in the meanwhile, the Government policy is in favour of providing services over the internet. Leaning objectives: The case serves to help students to understand the theoretical concept of Enterprise information systems infrastructure and services. It brings to the students understanding: the drivers of IT infrastructure to provide digital services; challenges that would make the social enterprise (in this case user-owned firm) to understand the opportunities and challenges of deploying the right digital infrastructure and get services on demand. The case presents the scenarios for the students to deliberate and find answers to the right approach for estimating the total cost of ownership (TCO). Social implications: The case situation presents a scenario for digital government services. Most of the customer-facing enterprises including social enterprises are also providing digital services. It is important that such services converge at an optimized TCO. Complexity academic level: Masters in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems.

,public good provision and democracy: evidence from an experiment with farmer groups in malawi,Nourani V.; Maertens A.; Michelson H.,World Development,0305750X,145,,-,2021,Elsevier Ltd,,"The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable development Goals (SDG) are a universal commitment to mobilize resources, a challenge for each State to meet its own goals, a new strategy that must rule world development programs, an action plan in favor of people and the planet. They have become a new moral commitment and the map that sets the course of governments, cities, companies, organizations, and citizens in the next ten years. Five years after their launch, the perspectives for meeting these goals by 2030 are uneven. There are critical areas and favorable trends in the international sphere (United Nations, 2019; Sachs et al., 2020); in the Spanish landscape, data is not much different, and there is a need to accelerate their implementation (Castiñeira, 2019; Ruiz & García, 2019; Sánchez et al., 2020). In this context, it is relevant to have indicators to assess and measure the degree of progress of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is also necessary to communicate and make them visible to transform the SDG into an option that allows citizens to choose organizations that offer more sustainable products and services (Silos et al., 2018). Communication is much more than an informative process; it is a management process of the relations between people. When speaking about communication as a space for dialogue and participation, it is necessary to address elements such as identity, perception, and the very action of communication for proper analysis. This article contextualizes current commitment and identification with SDG of companies and organizations; it goes deep into the perceptions and knowledge of citizens of these goals and focuses on SDG communication for social economy organizations. This researchs main objective is to review the contributions of social economy organizations to SDG communication. It departs from a perspective of its development, sensitization, and the raising of awareness towards them. To reach this objective, we start with two hypotheses: The first one, social economy organizations communication of the SDG is scarce; the second one, SDG communication, responds to a declarative model versus a participative model. The methodology used was a documentary and content analysis of social economy organizations communication of the SDG in Spain. To accomplish this analysis, we examined different representative families and entities of this sector. We tracked web sites, social media sites, studies, and reports from various organizations. We paid particular attention to organizations with greater economic relevance and representation in Spain, according to CEPES (Confederación Empresarial Española de la Economía Social -Spanish Enterprise Confederation for Social Economy). In total, we analyzed social media publications, web sites, and news spaces of close to a hundred companies between January 2018 and mid-September 2020. Additionally, we analyzed activities and published news to examine how SDG and the 2030 agenda were communicated, according to the three proposed tiers in the communication model. The three levels of the communication model are: declarative, where organizations limits to commit in writing or participate in SDG related events without thoroughly implementing the development of these goals within the organizations policies and defined strategies; informative, where the organization considers developing some of the SDG, inform and offer basic training to its employees and may even produce a report of the achievements in a registry format, and monitors and informs about its progress; and participative, were the members of the organization get involved in the implementation and become the leading prescribers and ambassadors of SDG, and also, the organization participates actively in the diffusion of SDG, with full integration within their communication channels. Finally, the article shows four social economy organization cases representing an excellent example of the communication models participation level. Regarding the results obtained, the majority of the hundred organizations analyzed have a web presence. However, their presence in the principal social media networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, is minimal and uneven. Similarly, only a few of the enterprises include SDG references or news on their web sites. The only ones that stand out with information on their websites are the cooperative organizations Cobadu, COPISO, Cajamar, Amiab Group, and Espriú Foundation. Out of 28 organizations associated with CEPES, eleven fluctuate between the communication models informative and participative tiers. The ten organizations are the very Spanish Enterprise Confederation for Social Economy (CEPES), CEPES Aragon, Catalunya Cooperative Confederation (Coopcat), Comunitat Valenciana Cooperative Confederation (Concoval), The Spanish Confederation of Consumer and User Cooperatives (Hispacoop), Agro-Alimentary Cooperatives of Spain, Mondragon, Coviran, Federation of Enterprise Associations of Inclusion Enterprises (FAEDEI), Espriú Foundation and Once. The article also analyzes four cases that show the ways a participative communication model may develop. The first case involves Gavina School in Picanya (Valencia), who developed a themed project on human rights and sustainable development goals with students aged 12 to 16 (1º to 4º ESO). Teachers, students, and parents were involved in the initiation and development of the educational project linked to the SDG; the second case also coincides with an academic project from the Sorolla Educational Group. It aimed at raising awareness and spreading the SDG. They produced an environmental project with the educative communitys participation (students, teachers, families, and service personnel). Various external stakeholders (companies and public offices) also participated; the third case involves an agricultural cooperative, Oleocampo, Cooperative Society of Andalucia. Oleocampo is an example of alignment with the 8th SDG creating quality job opportunities, commitment to biomass and edible oil tourism; and the fourth case, where Fruits de Ponent Cooperative includes all 17 SDG in their daily activities and produces sustainability reports. Web pages, social media, and sustainability reports are the main windows of communication of any organization with their context. The analysiss practical conclusions do not show a decisive wager for SDG from Spanish Social Economic organizations. Very few of the organizations leading their sectors have a well-defined communication strategy for SDG. The cases that include references of the SDG have a communication model in the declarative tier, where the commitment barely extends to the organizations members or towards society. Nevertheless, this does not mean that there is no concern or they are not working, but they are not communicating. Social Economy Organizations have in their origins SDG specific values, where people, context, and cooperation are fundamental. These values represent an opportunity we can not miss. It is necessary to continue communicating the SDG, communication must be action, and with a time frame of 10 years ahead, there is still much work citizens can do. Social economy organizations are better positioned to influence sustainability and SDG since they have good identity values to be the transmission belt of these goals. This research also shows the opportunity these organizations have to take the lead. It is a landscape of slow processes, where some goals lay far ahead. Social economy organizations have a chance to communicate their philosophy, values, and alignment with the SDG and the 2030 agenda. © 2021 CIRIEC-España",,10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105507,Cooperation; Democracy; Farmer groups; Malawi; Public goods experiment
,a multi-stakeholder participatory study identifies the priorities for the sustainability of the small ruminants farming sector in europe,Belanche A.; Martín-Collado D.; Rose G.; Yáñez-Ruiz D.R.,Animal,17517311,15,2,-,2021,Elsevier B.V.,,"Farmer groups are the cornerstone of many agricultural projects in low income countries. The success of such projects crucially depends on the ability of group members to cooperate. We conducted a series of public goods experiments to study within-group cooperation in Malawian farmer groups. We combine results from these experiments with survey data and qualitative interviews. Our results shed light on the heterogeneous capacity of groups to cooperate. We find that democratically run groups, in particular those with close social ties, are more cooperative compared to groups with leader-driven decision-making. Focus groups indicate that this democracy is deliberative in nature, characterized by open discussion that aggregates preferences, increases common knowledge, and creates goodwill. A second set of experiments in which we experimentally vary the decision-making processes yields quantitatively similar results in arbitrary groupings of farmers and null results in pre-existing groups with established decision-making procedures, demonstrating the stickiness of institutional rules. Our results imply that group formation and functioning needs to be included in the design phase of agricultural projects in low income countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.animal.2020.100131,Dairy; Goat production; Meat; Sheep production; Sustainability

This sector has diverse livestock species, breeds, production systems and products, which makes difficult to have a clear vision of its challenges through using conventional analyses. A multi-stakeholder and multi-step approach, including 90 surveys, was used to identify and assess the main challenges for the sustainability of the ESRS to prioritize actions. These challenges and actions were identified by ESRS experts including farmers, cooperatives, breeding associations, advisers and researchers of six EU countries and Turkey. From the 30 identified challenges, the most relevant were economy-related challenges such as uncertainty of meat and milk prices, volatility of commodity prices, low farm income, high subsidy dependency and uncertainty in future changes in subsidies resulting in a sector not attractive to young farmers. Most of these challenges were beyond the farmer's control and perceived as difficult to address. Challenges were prioritized using an index, calculated by multiplying the relevance and the feasibility to address measures. The identified challenges had a similar priority index across the whole sector with small differences across livestock species (sheep vs goats), type of products (meat vs dairy) and intensification levels (intensive vs semi-intensive vs extensive). The priorities were different, however, between socio-geographical regions (Southern vs Central Europe). Some of the top prioritized challenges were linked to aspects related to the production systems (low promotion of local breeds and slow adaptability of high producing breeds) and market practices (unfair trade/lack of traceability). The majority of the priority challenges, however, were associated with a deficient knowledge or training at farm level (poor business management training, lack of professionalization, slow adoption of innovations), academia (researchers do not address real problems) and society as a whole (low consumer education in local products, low social knowledge about farming, poor recognition of farming public services). Thus, improved collaboration among the different stakeholders across the food chain with special implication of farmers, associations of producers, academia and governments is needed to facilitate knowledge exchange and capacity building. These actions can contribute to make ESRS economically more sustainable and to adapt the production systems and policy to the current and future societal needs in a more region-contextualized framework. © 2020 The Authors",,10.17576/pengurusan-2021-62-10,Co-operatives; Influencing factors; Peninsular Malaysia; Performance; Single mother

This study mainly examines the number of active and inactive co-operatives and identifies the key factors influencing their success or failure. The research evaluated 23 co-operative groups of single mothers. The performance of the cooperatives was analysed through in-depth interviews with officers of the Malaysian Co-operative Societies Commission (MCSC). Despite the governments financial and non-financial assistance, the findings indicate that co-operatives have not performed well. The preliminary results suggest that inactive single mother co-operatives are higher than those active ones. This study found that 61% of the total single mother co-operatives in Peninsular Malaysia are inactive (dormant and non-operational) compared to 39% active ones. Four influencing factors contribute to a higher percentage of inactive co-operatives: limited resources, dependence on subsidies and sponsors, managerial incompetency, and member participation. The results suggest solutions for the management of single mother co-operatives and provide additional information and contribution to the parties involved to empower the association to fulfil the economic, social, and cultural requirements. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

There is a recent debate on the interdependence between management control practices, which emerges from the discussion of control packages or systems. This study delves into this discussion by investigating the complementarity between gainsharing (group incentive modality) and performance evaluation in a credit union context, given the need for qualitative empirical studies on this phenomenon. This study is considered relevant because the joint use of management control practices can allow organizations to effectively mitigate control problems such as lack of direction, motivation, and competence. This research promotes insights into management control practices operation  given the discussion of complementarity between gainsharing, which is not a prevalent incentive system in most organizations  and objective and subjective performance evaluation. The methodology consists of a qualitative field study in a credit union using data collection, interviews, and access to documents analyzed using an interpretive approach. This research presents evidence on the phenomenon of interdependence between management control practices, adding to the literature by addressing different forms of complementarity between a group incentive system in the form of gainsharing and performance evaluation. It became evident that gainsharing reinforces the objective performance evaluation process by mitigating motivation and direction problems, while the subjective performance evaluation compensates the objective performance evaluation by shifting the focus of the evaluation to the individuals skills. © 2021 Universidade de Sao Paulo.

Design/methodology/approach: Through a presentation of four narrative cases, the paper exemplifies international experiences of co-operative approaches to place-making. It critically reflects on the philosophical and strategic underpinnings of the projects implemented in Rochdale, Preston, Bologna, Rome and Cincinnati. Findings: The practical experiences of a number of local projects of place-making involving co-operatives are conceptualised. The research has identified the importance of institutional, organisational and legal constraints for transformative cooperative-based place-making initiatives. It shows a strong relevance of the places historic legacy and communal governance for the choice of place-making approaches. Research limitations/implications: Further investigation is needed to establish whether co-operatives have the same driving force potential in terms of local regeneration and community wealth building place-making in non-Western contexts and less developed locations.

The authorities gave priority to the local smallholders, relegating settlers to a minor role within colonial agriculture and the coffee economy in particular. This generated a vigorous protest among the settlers against the government policy. The tension would bring a number of remarkable developments, including the establishment of the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association (KNPA) and, later, the promulgation of legislation regulating coffee farming and marketing via cooperatives, such as the Co-operative Societies Ordinance No. 7 of 1932 and the Native Coffee Control Ordinance No 26 of 1937. This paper examines the interlocked dimensions and intricacies related to the coffee industry policies, and their impact on agricultural policies in Kilimanjaro region as well as across the country. In particular, the paper discusses how the settlers' opposition influenced the promulgation of segregative, monopolistic and protectionist legislations, and the role of control Boards in this process. To do so, this paper relies on existing literature as well as underutilized primary sources obtained from the Tanzania National Archives (TNA) in Dar es Salaam. © 2021 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System",,10.17765/2176-9168.2021v14Supl.1.e9399,Operational research; Storage; Supply networks; Transport

The study used a disproportionate stratified sampling method, with 308 valid samples collected from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the districts and the Management Boards of ACs in 9 provinces in MD. Performance of AC is measured against five indicators, namely return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), responsiveness to cooperative members needs, and generation of jobs. Multivariate regression method was used for data analysis. The estimated results identified four factors that are positively correlated with cooperatives performance (namely management competency; contributed capital; membership size; and members participation) while indicating interaction between independent variables (management competency and contributed capital; management competency and membership size) in the relationship to performance of co-operatives. The study findings showed that the degree of influence of management competency on performance of cooperatives in fruit tree farming is always higher compared with those in rice farming. In addition, a number of recommendations are proposed to help the ACs management boards make appropriate improvements to the support policy and performance evaluation indicators of the cooperatives. Cooperatives should also innovate in the use and optimization of resources. © Author(s) 2022.",,10.1080/0969160X.2021.1952886,accountability; credit unions; Government; Indonesia; regulation

Adopting a qualitative methodology involving a case study approach, two credit unions are examined, through focus group discussions with credit union management and review of credit unions annual reports and strategic plans. Findings reveal few formal compliance-based accountability mechanisms in relation to government, and limited emphasis on these mechanisms by credit unions. However, informally, credit unions involved government in various strategic ways to demonstrate accountability and legitimacy, and seek support from them, thereby managing the regulatory space to maintain a lightly-regulated context. This paper provides insights into how credit unions adopted a predominantly co-operative approach to manage and negotiate a space of limited regulation by actively demonstrating legitimacy and accountability. Presented in the form of an engagement pyramid involving four levels (i.e. compliance, self-regulation within the sector, engaging with regulators, and selectively challenging regulation perceived as unfair or unhelpful), this approach is particularly important given the seemingly less effective regulatory frameworks in more developed countries. It provides a reference for other organisations, both within the third sector and beyond, to consider how their actions might respond to and constructively shape the regulatory space, beyond comply or evade. © 2021 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.",,10.1002/aepp.13068,Agriculture; Cooperatives; Farm; Research

Although this system maintains a wide range of varieties and helps ensure access to seed, its ability to create and widely disseminate new varieties to meet evolving opportunities and challenges is limited. A network of farmer groups, public breeding programs, and development organizations collaborating in decentralized creation and dissemination of sorghum varieties in Mali is examined regarding (1) how the network developed and what activities it conducts; (2) the resulting varietal diversity, varietal performance and organizational models; and (3) the elements of the traditional seed system that were maintained, strengthened or transformed. A single-case study approach was used that relies on published literature, official catalogues of released varieties and a database of farmer seed-cooperative requests for foundation seed. The functioning of the network and its varietal-, seed-, and organizational- outcomes are documented and the elements of the traditional sorghum seed system that are maintained or strengthened are analyzed. The evolution of the networks reliance on commoning as a social process and its strengthening of core Seed Commons features are discussed with a view to the networks contributions to targeted development outcomes and potential replicability. The case demonstrates how creating a framework for collaboration, enabling actors and organizations to take on collective responsibility while maintaining distributed decision-making at local level, opens opportunities for transforming farming- and food-systems towards sustainability and resilience. © 2020, The Author(s).",,10.18543/baidc-59-2021pp263-283,Agricultural cooperative; Corporate social responsibility; Organizational commitment

The method of data collection is using the standard questionnaire of corporate social responsibility (CSR) based on the Carol model and organizational commitment (OC) based on the Allen-Meyer model. Data validity was confirmed by Bartlett test and KMO coefficient and its reliability was confirmed by Cronbachs alpha. The statistical population of this study was the agricultural cooperatives with managed by the Rural Cooperative Organization (RCO) of Isfahan Province in Iran. The results of this research showed that from the members viewpoint, the highest corporate social responsibility was in the legal dimension and the lowest was in the discretionary dimension as based on the Carol model. The research results show that the organizational commitment index of managers is nearly of 50%. The results of cluster analysis in the field of members perception of cooperative social responsibility showed that the four variables such as: performance satisfaction, members participation in cooperative meetings, age and purpose of membership, predicts the members behavior in separating the cooperative into two groups with strong and weak the CSR.

They account for approximately half of agricultural trade in the EU. By contrast, in the EU Western countries, where farmer cooperatives are widespread and successful, agricultural cooperation in Lithuania has developed intermittently in the last century. We still have very limited knowledge of why the countrys agricultural producers (especially smallholder farmers) are reluctant to cooperate in Lithuania. The aim of this study is to assess the level of the willingness to cooperate among smallholder farmers in Lithuania and to draw up the profiles of small-scale farms that participate in and intend to join cooperatives and, conversely, that do not participate in cooperatives and do not intend to do so. To achieve this goal, a representative survey of small-scale farms was conducted. Results of surveys carried out in 2019 in Lithuania on a group of 1002 small-scale farms showed that only 8% of the surveyed farms participate in producer groups or cooperatives, while another 8% intend to participate. Small-scale farms in Lithuania have weak market integration, with no bargaining power on input and output markets. The vast majority of small-scale farms are reluctant to participate in cooperative activities in Lithuania. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the profile of a small farm that tends to cooperate. The main social characteristics of farm managers and economic factors of farms willing to cooperate have been identified. © 2021 by the authors.

Data were collected via interview and group discussion, while data analysis involved data explanation and description. The results revealed that the development of a management system for adding to the competitiveness of Yalas agro-community enterprises consists of the development of organizational structure, the member system, and a development plan management system. It was also found that the development of the potential of agro-community enterprise relates to adding value to the market share of durian by applying the concept of integration through the supply chain and value chain.

Information was collected through mixed method research, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected via interview from 30 knowledgeable experienced stakeholders of Thai co-operatives, with information recorded for later analysis. Quantitative data were collected via a survey involving 300 co-operative organisations from seven categories of enterprise, taking relevant samples, and was analysed together with the data from interviews with member stakeholders. Analysis also utilised descriptive statistics, namely: frequency, percentages, averages, and standard deviation. Results revealed that Thai co-operatives were in compliance with all seven principles to a reasonably high standard in the following order of statistical significance: 2nd (highest), 7th, 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th (lowest). From these findings, it is recommended that Thai co-operative leaders strive for continued improvements, developing higher standards and consistency among their members and staff to achieve greater parity with the International Principles and the worldwide co-operative business community. This can be facilitated through better education, extension of knowledge, personal development, and encouragement for staff and members. It is also suggested that the government provide additional support for co-operatives in working together to achieve a common goal. © 2021.

The objective of this research is to identify institutional factors that can affect agribusiness inclusive models. In this research, agricultural cooperatives of banana production in the province of Magdalena, Colombia, are the unit of analysis to identify institutional factors. The method of review of institutional factors is the multiple cases (six banana cooperatives) with a simple unit using inductive analysis. The results show that institutional factorsboth formal (certifications, quality standards, social responsibility policies and economic incentives) and informal (cooperation, improvement of quality of life, generation of social capital)promote the development of inclusive businesses in cooperatives of the base of the pyramid.

However, farmers all over Europe show limited adoption of SRP. Marginal lands are considered a promising option for producing SRP biomass and avoiding conflicts with food production. This study focuses on the Malacky region in Western Slovakia because of suitable land quality and a board production site close by providing a significant local market for the produced biomass. Qualitative interviews in 2018 explored personal and situational factors that influenced local farmers (N = 19) willingness to adopt SRP. Slovakias land fragmentation in combination with the required landowners consent, competition with food production, and lack of identification with SRP were identified as prominent barriers. The economic benefit from using low quality lands and environmental benefits from SRP were identified incentives. Moreover, the study found agricultural cooperatives more open to SRP than agricultural business companies, as they are more interested in the economic benefits and prefer agricultural activity over fallow land. Because the study identified conflicting views about the possible impacts of SRP on the environment and the rural community, it is considered crucial to provide farmers with science-based facts on these issues. This aspect should also be acknowledged to increase acceptance of stakeholders, such as land owners, governmental actors, and the general public, which is needed to develop measures to encourage SRP. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.14505/jemt.11.3(43).21,Agricultural cooperatives; Agricultural products; Development; Economic effect; Financing; Grants; Peasant (farmer) farms; Personal subsidiary farms; Social effect; State programs; State projects; Subsidies

Materials and methods: tools and methods of financial assistance, including grants, for peasant (farm) farms in the Sverdlovsk region are analyzed. These mechanisms are used in the implementation of state programs for the development of the agro-industrial complex at the Federal and regional levels. The identified problems of agricultural development allow us not only to formulate recommendations for improving the mechanisms for implementing measures to support farmers, but also to pay attention to aspects that are not taken into account by state programs. The authors relied on statistical, structural, analytical, system, logical, and correlation analysis. The normative legal basis of the study was chosen by the normative legal acts of Russian Federation and Sverdlovsk region, including state programs, national and priority regional projects implemented in the field of agriculture, and official materials of state statistics. Results: the effectiveness of the main instruments of state support for farmers in the region is evaluated, recommendations for improving the mechanisms of support for farmers in Sverdlovsk region are developed, and directions for the development of rural cooperation are proposed. Discussion: the article presents a socio-economic analysis of the support and development of peasant (farm) farms by the state government authorities of Sverdlovsk region. The authors pay special attention to the fact that during the implementation of state programs and projects, certain aspects are not taken into account when evaluating applications for state funding, which were identified by researchers in Estonia and Latvia. Conclusion: it is necessary to regularly assess the effectiveness and then correlate the tools used to support peasant (farm) farms. In order to increase efficiency, it is necessary to apply correlation analysis of statistical data to public authorities and conduct sociological research (in the future). © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

The search for labor stability necessarily takes us back to the times of the Welfare State, which contributed to the construction of a sense of community in the urban environment. The objective of this research was to analyze proximity or distance to the characteristics of work in the liquid and solid modernity and the Social and Solidarity Economy of small family cooperatives in Mexico City. The questions to be answered in this article are: Are the working conditions that were present in the Welfare State the same as those proposed to be achieved by the Social and Solidarity Economy? And, being two different theoretical frameworks, what then are the particularities of work in the Social and Solidarity Economy? The research methodology was mixed, quantitative for the selection of cooperatives that met two requirements: appropriate cooperative management and economic viability, this was done through a discriminant analysis, a multivariate statistical technique. The database used to perform the discriminations was that of the 2015 Economic Diagnosis on Cooperativism of the Federal District, with 192 cooperatives representative at 90% confidence of 1,589. The methodology was developed in detail in Luvián, Rosas, and Ramírez (2019) from the crossings resulted in 22 cooperatives with the economic viability and 130 with appropriate cooperative management, from which 12 cooperatives were reached that met both criteria. However, for reasons of accessibility, only eight could be interviewed. The qualitative methodology considered the theoretical approach to determine the categories of analysis and thematic axes of the interviews: capital-labor, space-time, and community and individual. The principles for internal management were taken from cooperativism: democratic control, democratic participation, and autonomy and independence; with emphasis on democracy through the organization chart (General Assembly, Board of Directors, and Supervisory Board). The interviews were applied to the legal representatives of the cooperatives. The responses were analyzed employing the categorization method to process the text of the interviews through categories and subcategories and thus present through words or short phrases the similarities and differences of the interviewees through the themes and components of the topic. The categories were organized through networks with the Atlas ti.8 software, examining mainly aspects such as the basis and density of the networks with the co-occurrence method. The results show that cooperatives present stability conditions like those existing in solid modernity such as: maintaining the equivalent of a fixed salary, having a stable workplace, fixed working hours, and forming a social welfare fund. However, there are fundamental differences in the way these conditions of stability are achieved in the Social and Solidarity Economy, which have to do with the organization of work within cooperatives. The main difference between work in solid modernity and work in the Social and Solidarity Economy is the existence of emancipated work. Emancipated work is a work of unique characteristics, it is not exploited work, since the ownership of the means of production of the cooperative is collective, it is not subordinated either because decisions are taken horizontally and mainly by consensus; it is not sanctioned, its fulfillment is given practically by the feeling of community of the cooperative; it is a work that allows creativity and human development. The literature supports the evidence that stability generates predictability and long-term planning due to the commitment of the members; this condition is present in cooperative management thanks to the existence of emancipated labor. In the long term, the space-time relationship of half of the cooperatives that operate with generational change in a family manner stands out. Future planning has been translated into concrete strategies for market growth, improvement of infrastructure, equipment, and use of the principle of open membership, by recovering the creativity of the members in the General Assembly. The research distinguishes two types of members, the leaders who act to guarantee collective stability through their shared commitment, direction, empathy, and recognition of the work done, which legitimizes them, and the followers who support the leaders efforts to maintain labor stability; both under a social relationship that is not based on surplus value. It is argued that the cooperatives have the capacity to make decisions shared because the consequences derive from the work of both. In the analyzed cooperatives there are no restrictions to the deployment of leadership, the results show a better positioning of the cooperatives that have more leaders because having more members involved in management enhances democratic participation and collectively acquired knowledge. This was exemplified by the activities of the management positions of the Board of Directors and Supervisory Board, which, following the law and commitment to the organization, contribute strategically to production, commercialization, and sound accounting, activities on which the conditions of stability depend (although there are also leading members without management positions). The limitation of the research has to do with the number of cooperatives interviewed and the characteristics of qualitative research, which prevents the results from being generalized to other cooperatives in Mexico City, other states, or the country. However, the results are theoretically framed in the structural tendencies experienced by the subjects of liquid modernity in neoliberalism, so they can be a reference. The originality and implications of the work lie in recognizing the ambivalence in the rationality of the subjects, when identifying the coexisting modernities to know what makes the stability of cooperatives possible in the urban environment, even when apparently only individualism and competition could prevail. On the other hand, emancipated work is a category little explored in the Social and Solidarity Economy, it emerged from both theoretical and applied analysis and made it possible to examine particularities that are deployed from the form of organization and management presented by cooperatives that adhere to a greater extent to the principles and cooperative organization. Emancipated work requires the collective control of the means of production typical of the Social and Solidarity Economy to advance towards an alternative economy and contributes to creative and democratic work that improves the living conditions of the partners and consequently their own life, and even those of the following generations for the creation of loyalty, feelings of community, identity, and enjoyment of the fruits of work. © 2021.

How should the relationships within agrifood supply chains be envisaged in order to obtain greater sustainability combined with better added-value distribution? This article introduces a new approach for supply chain organization and management: the sustainable demand-supply chain. The paper mobilizes both management, organization and innovation literatures, together with a case study based on data from farmers, cooperatives and distributors in the pork sector. The originality of the paper lies in its modelization of sustainable demand-supply chains. The results show that new relationships need to be implemented between all stakeholders, including consumers  both to share information and to define their new added-value distribution. The results identify the key points of this new supply chain coordination and indicate policy recommendations for organizational innovations. © 2020 Filippi et al.",,10.17170/kobra-202102113202,Agribusiness; Competitiveness; Cooperatives; Management

This moment is marked by the advancement of market globalisation, which has exerted great competitive pressure on national agribusiness. To survive and thrive in a globalised and fiercely competitive environment, cooperatives must face new challenges in the pursuit of competitive-ness. This study aimed to identify and describe the main success or failure factors affecting agricultural cooperatives. To this end, bibliographic research was used as a research method, and 108 relevant works from the national and international literature were selected for analysis. The results pointed to the existence of 10 main success factors for agro-industrial cooperatives: conciliation of the dual agenda: social and economic goals; professionalisation of management; meeting the interests of multiple stakeholders; transaction cost management; risk and volatility manage-ment; improved commercialisation; competitiveness against traditional companies; technology adoption; sustainable development; and social responsibility. However, there is a gap regarding the existence of studies analysing, in an integrated manner, the prevalence and benefits of the success factors identified for agricultural cooperatives, especially those based in Brazil. © Author(s) 2021.",,10.36956/rwae.v1i1.242,Agriculture Insurance; Claims; Crop insurance; Farmers; Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana

In addition, heavy rainfall for the past two years has adversely affected agriculture produce in the entire state putting farmers into debt trap as most of them are not covered by crop insurance for crop failure. Although crop insurance was available to farmers in India since 1972, the coverage across the states including Karnataka was not found to be satisfactory. The average percentage of farmers covered under crop insurance was less than 10% during 1999-2015, both for India and Karnataka. It was 11.3% under NAIS 2015 kharif, increased to 12.2% in 2016, 17.1% in 2017 going down to 15.6% in 2018 and to 14.1% in 2019 under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) kharif in Karnataka. PMFBY was one new kind of agriculture insurance company and introduced throughout the country in 2016.This paper examines the performance of this scheme with specific reference to north Karnataka based on primary data collected from farmers survey in four districts, secondary data collected from official documents and first-hand information gathered from regional stakeholder workshops organized in six selected districts of north Karnataka. The study tries to look into the extent of coverage and, flaws and merits of crop insurance schemes with reference to problems faced by farmers in getting insurance coverage and claims. The study covered around 1000 stakeholders including farmers, officials of banks, department of economics and statistics, agriculture department and insurance agencies, representatives of gram panchayats and cooperative societies. Three agricultural crop seasons have passed since then. Central government has brought in some changes in guidelines and is likely to make further changes in procedures in response to concerns expressed by States and farmers representatives. Follow up discussions with key stakeholders in Karnataka held after the initial farmers survey reveal that while a few of the anomalies in applying for crop insurance have been addressed by the concerned departments, major obstacles in assessment and claims continue to exasperate farmers who are miffed by these procedural lapses. This paper throws light on some of these issues and discusses measures to make crop insurance, particularly PMFBY farmers friendly. © 2020, Nan Yang Academy of Sciences Pte. Ltd.

,climate mitigation and hidden vulnerabilities: widening the food gap between the global north and south,Yawson D.O.,Environmental Justice,19394071,13,6,210-221,2020,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,,"Among other things, fertility control in Nigeria may not be feasible without recourse to socioeconomic issues such as micro-occupation classification and dominant family cultural traditions facing women and their relationship to fertility behaviour. Rural small-scale women farmers are a relatively closed group with some uniqueness for the understanding of the value of children (VOC) in socioeconomic and cultural contexts and its relationship with fertility behaviour in developing nations. This study, guided by the VOC model, focuses on determining factors for preference for family size (0-4 children) among rural small-scale women farmers in Eha-Amufun in Enugu state. 200 married women (mean age = 33.9; mean age at marriage = 24.5) from 20 agricultural co-operative societies were selected for the study. The study adopted a survey and quantitative research design. Besides the sociodemographic information of the study participants, the study elicited from the respondents information on their choice of family size, the connection of family size with their occupation and the circumstances surrounding son preference and son adoption in the family and rural contexts. The collected data were analysed using the ordinal logistic regression model. The findings show that economic independence, son preference and male child adoption negates limiting family sizes to 0-4 (p<.05) however, age, formal education, children as source of labour and economic independence were positively correlated with the desire for a family size of 4 children and above. In view of the limitations of the study and the ability of the VOC model to unveil spurious factors for fertility behaviour among women, there is a need for comparative studies of rural closed groups in developing nations and their fertility behaviour. © 2021, Bundesinstitut fur Bevolkerungsforschung.

Future UK feed barley supply was assessed under the influence of projected climate change, climate mitigation policy scenarios, and population growth. The results showed that land-based climate mitigation policies reduced land area for barley and created large deficits in supply. Using Algeria and Tunisia as exemplar global south countries that rely on barley supply from the United Kingdom and Europe for food and feed, the article concludes that pursuit of land-based mitigation policies, in the global north, which reduce the production of globally important food security crops, can create or amplify food vulnerabilities in the global south. Tunisia's imports, for example, are about 290% of domestic production. These countries need feed barley to maintain high domestic animal production for food and religious needs, which limit meat imports. The asymmetries in technical, economic, and political power between the global north and south imply that the latter could be outcompeted. In serving the climate justice principle of ""equitable sharing of burdens and benefits,""the article argues that climate mitigation policies should address (not amplify) the uneven geographical and social impacts of climate change. This principle should be integral to the appraisal of public policies and actions on land-based climate mitigation policies and prioritized in climate justice discourse in a genuine global cooperative framework. This is as urgent as the need for climate mitigation action. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",,10.34044/j.kjss.2021.42.1.03,Activity-based costing method; Aroma; Cost analysis; Hom Mali rice; Logistics; Processing cost

A reduction in the aroma or 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) of Hom Mali rice during post-harvesting activities has become a major problem for stakeholders and exporters in the rice supply chain. This paper investigated logistics and processing cost analysis of the rice mills of two agricultural cooperatives, AC1 and AC2, by using the activity-based costing (ABC) method. Moreover, the relationship between the loss of aroma and the cost processing activity has been explored using partial correlation. Findings showed that the total cost of AC1 was 4.986 baht/kg, which was separated into the logistics cost of 58.18 percent and the processing cost of 41.82 percent. The total cost of AC2 was 5.851 baht/kg, consisting of the logistics cost of 77.34 percent and the processing cost of 22.66 percent. For the processing activities, the significant relationship between the activity costs and the loss of aroma, while controlling the levels of 2AP, suggested that aroma retaining must regard decisions on the selections of processing activities including polishing, whitening, bagging, and dehulling activities. In the logistics aspect, the cooperatives should focus on raw material receiving, warehousing, packing, and transportation activities. Decisions on the improvement of logistics and processing activities involved with aroma loss of Hom Mali rice should rely on cost analysis, maintaining the quality of rice, and meeting both domestic and international demand. © 2021 Kasetsart University.",,10.3905/jsf.2020.1.101,

The study was conducted in Nairobi County and all the licensed SACCOs under (SASRA) Sacco Society Regulatory Authority in Kenya were included in the study. Key findings indicated that 76% of the companies can be classified as adopters. The implication here is that nearly three out of every four SACCOs have adopted at least one form of e-commerce to support their business operations. The key factors identified in the study to influence e-commerce adoption in the participating SACCOs were technology cost (88%), available budget (41%), and senior management support that were captured from about 25% of the respondents. From the study, two critical barriers to effective utilisation of e-commerce for SACCOs in their business operations are the conservative organisation cultures that can be summed up as resistant to change and lack of peerage on the industry standards.

This article examines the introduction of co-operatives on New Hanover and Buka islands and their subsequent failure. In the aftermath of these disappointments, new local organizations arose and adopted many of the positive practices learnt during the co-operative period. These new groups provided both material and cultural independence, and, further, proved to be micro-nationalist movements with a power base capable of challenging the Australian administration. This article argues that co-operatives have been undervalued and overlooked as a platform for Indigenous notions of socio-economic development and micro-nationalist movements.

The agricultural producers cooperative game problem in contract farming is formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear program. Using the strong duality theory of stochastic linear programs, we not only prove that the core of agricultural producers cooperative game is nonempty but also provide a simple way to compute a profit allocation policy in the core. We establish the convexity of agricultural producers cooperative game so that the game has population monotonicity, which gives agricultural producers an incentive to expand their current coalition. We then analyze the agricultural producers cooperative game with a concave cost structure, which may exhibit economies of scale for production. Taking advantage of the proposed stochastic duality approach, the agricultural producers cooperative game with a concave cost structure is also shown to have a nonempty core. © 2020 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.",,10.1108/IJSE-04-2020-0189,Driving forces; Financial planning; Ghana; Retirement; Self-employed

However, the results are mixed and limited research in the co-operatives context has creates a great interest to fill the conspicuous gap. This study seeks to examine the potential relationship between board characteristics and co-operative reputation in Malaysia from the perspective of resource-based view theory (RBVT). Hence, multiple regressions were conducted to analyze the relationship between co-operatives reputation with the respect of Top 100 Co-operatives Index and board characteristics in terms of board size, ethnic diversity, gender diversity, age diversity and education diversity in this study. The sample is composed of 61 listed co-operatives in the Top 100 Co-operatives Index for the three-consecutive year during the period 2015 to 2017. Reputation data were obtained from Top 100 Co-operative Index that published at Malaysia Co-operative Societies Commission (MCSC) website. While, the data of board characteristics and co-operative size on log of total assets which lagged by a year were extracted from MCSC's INFOKOP system that provides both financial and non-financial data. The results found that Malaysian co-operatives that appear high up in terms of ranking in the reputation MCSC index tend to have a greater proportion of high educational directors on their board. Other board characteristics including board size, ethnic diversity, gender diversity and age diversity were not associated with the reputation of co-operatives. This generally can be explained that different types of law, geography, historical background, cultural environment and other factors may affect composition and diversity; and particularly the board in co-operative societies.

Methods/Statistical analysis: A research model was developed, based on previous studies, by selecting Empowerment, Use of Collective Intelligence, and Continuous Learning, selected as Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture, and Servant Leadership and Perceived Organizational Support (POS) as the influencing variables. The relationships among variables were identified using regression analysis and mediating effect analysis. The subjects were workers working at headquarters of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and the Agribusiness Group. The questionnaire survey was conducted for about one month from Jan., 2020 and a total of 157 valid samples were obtained. SPSS (Ver. 22.0) was used in statistical analysis. Findings: The results showed that the Servant Leadership has statistically significant effect on Empowerment and Use of Collective Intelligence but not on Continuous Learning which are Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture. The Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has statistically significant effect on all of the Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture: Empowerment, Use of Collective Intelligence, and Continuous Learning. The results of mediating effect analysis showed that POS partially mediated the effect of Servant Leadership on Empowerment and Use of Collective Intelligence and fully mediated the effect on Continuous Learning. The results suggested that, for the establishment of agile culture in an organization, it is very important to exercise Servant Leadership, which is a leadership that maximize the potential of the members of the organization based on the spirit of human respect, and to give to members the perception of the full support and rewards provided by organization. Improvements/Applications: This study was conducted for employees working at a specific organization therefore it is difficult to generalize the results to overall industries and organizations. In the future, it is necessary to expand sample population and to conduct comparative studies between groups that have introduced agile organizational culture and ones that does not. It is also recommended to conduct additional studies on the factors of leadership and organizational support that have effect on the characteristics of agile organizational culture. © 2020, Sciedu Press.",,10.1590/1982-7849rac2020190332,cooperation; cooperative; development; organizations; systems

Among the 797 samples, 401 were owned by large-scale farms (herd size >500 cows, for dairy cow farming), 303 were owned by milk processing plants (herd size >500 cows, for dairy cow farming + milk processing), and 93 were owned by small farm cooperatives (herd size ?500 cows, for dairy cow farming). The results revealed the presence of AFM1 in 94 of the 797 samples (11.80%). None of them was above 500 ng/L (Chinese and US limit standard), whereas 0.88% were above 50 ng/L (EU limit standard). The AFM1 concentrations in samples non-compliant with the EU standard were 52, 61, 88, 89.5, 164, 240, and 486 ng/L, respectively. It is important to note that samples exceeding the EU limit were mainly found in the area of Jiangsu and Guangxi provinces, and the herd type of milk processing plants. Hence, it is necessary to monitor and enforce the regulatory compliance of AFM1 levels in the raw milk from these specific areas and herd type.Highlights A total of 797 raw milk samples from three herd types, were collected from ten provinces of Southern China in 2018. Ninety-four of the 797 raw milk samples (11.80%) were positive for AFM1, and none of them was above the Chinese and US legal limit, only 0.88% of samples were above the EU limit. All of the exceed samples defined by EU limit were found in the area of Jiangsu and Guangxi provinces and belonged to milk processing plants. © 2021 The Author(s).

,do sustainability standards benefit smallholder farmers also when accounting for cooperative effects? evidence from cote d'ivoire,Sellare J.; Meemken E.-M.; Kouamé C.; Qaim M.,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,29092,102,2,681-695,2020,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,,"Why are vigilant organizations better at developing foresight than their rivals and acting faster on the insights and alerts? Four attributes were hypothesized to explain the difference between vigilant and vulnerable organizations: (a) a leadership commitment to sensing and acting early on signals of change, (b) strategic investments in foresight abilities, (c) a flexible approach to incorporating uncertainty in their strategy processes, and (d) clear accountability and coordination for sharing information and acting on weak signals. This conceptual model was tested with survey responses from 345 organizational leaders representing three sectors of the economy: international companies, US credit unions, and American foundations. The survey assessed key components of the above constructs and our regression models explained close to half of the variance in organizational vigilance scores relative to competitors. The most important of the four factors above was investment in foresight (for each sector), followed by leadership commitment. The relative importance of strategy and accountability factors varied by sector as well as organizational size. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,10.1002/ajae.12015,Certification; cocoa; cooperatives; Côte d'Ivoire; Fairtrade; sustainability standards
,allocation of property rights in emerging governance models of agricultural cooperatives in mato grosso do sul: a comparative analysis with traditional cooperatives,da Silva A.H.; Caleman S.M.D.Q.,Revista de Economia e Sociologia Rural,1032003,59,3,1-19,2021,Sociedade Brasileira de Economia e Sociologia Rural,,"Although many studies analyzed effects of sustainability standardssuch as Fairtrade or Rainforest Allianceon smallholder farmers in developing countries, most did not sufficiently account for systematic differences between certified and noncertified farmers. Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector. © 2020 The Authors.

This study seeks a greater deepening of the allocation of property rights in agricultural cooperatives in Mato Grosso do Sul/Brazil. The qualitative research was carried out in 4 agricultural cooperatives, two considered an emerging model and two traditional cooperatives. The investigation was conducted through the analysis of minutes of Ordinary General Meetings, statutes, and semi-structured interviews with managers and presidents. It was observed that the agricultural cooperatives, seen as an emerging model, where there is a selection of new members and act in a purchasing pool format, demonstrate an evolution concerning the traditional model by pointing to a greater professionalization of management, evidence of the separation between property and management. Moreover, the emerging model becomes more attractive than the traditional one by efficiently allocating the residual rights (earnings). © 2021.

However, the performance of the Malaysian aquaculture sector, particularly seaweed production, is poorly documented. This is the first empirical study to undertake a value chain analysis (VCA) of the Malaysian seaweed sector using stakeholder perceptions and secondary data that encompass members of seaweed farming cooperatives (the Semporna Area Farmers Association and the governments flagship Seaweed Cluster Project). Fieldwork was conducted between April and June 2015 among seaweed stakeholders involved in the value chain using a mixed methods approachin-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions, household surveys, personal observation and secondary data. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from both upstream (seaweed farming, marketing structure and the Malaysian Good Aquaculture Practices [MyGAP] certification programme) and downstream (seaweed processing) activities involving farmers, intermediaries/middlemen (buyers), processors and officials. Kappaphycus spp. was sold in two forms: (1) dried seaweed to be used as raw materials in carrageenan processing (approximately 90% of total harvest) and (2) fresh seaweed to be used as a source of seedlings (approximately 10% of total harvest). The value chain ended with the carrageenan form, which is exported to international markets. The price of dried seaweed varied according to a combination of seaweed quality, the strength of farmers relationships with intermediaries and processors and in response to demand from the carrageenan industry. The prices obtained by Malaysian farmers for dried seaweed and carrageenan remained low, US$ 0.60 and US$ 4.43 per kg, respectively, despite efforts by the government to enhance the value chain by imposing seaweed standards (via MyGAP) for farm management, dried seaweed and semi-refined carrageenan. The VCA was a useful tool to identify and map the market, with the results providing a better understanding of the seaweed sector, which could be helpful in supporting further aquaculture development in Malaysia. © 2019, The Author(s).",,10.5585/REMARK.V19I4.16122,Credit cooperative; Information systems; Internal communication; Internal Marketing; Leadership

Method: A descriptive quantitative research (911 individuals) was applied, using structural equation and cross-sectional modeling, with an instrument based on Dessler (2006), Lings and Greenley (2005), Tortosa, Moliner and Sánchez (2009) and Park and Tran (2018). Originality/Relevance: The study of specific aspects of Internal Marketing (communication, leadership and information systems) is new in the context of Marketing. Previous work has focused especially in communication, as it already satisfies the most visible need for Marketing activities in organizations. Results: The results indicated that there is an effective contribution of internal communication to organizational objectives, and that the process of communication and leadership play a key role in these objectives. However, it was found that information technology systems, acquired to facilitate the organization's communication process, have a negative influence on internal communication and its objectives.

Generally, there are two competing agrifood governance models for advancing sustainability: technocratic and deliberative democratic procedures. Taking up Fischers (Citizens, experts, and the environment: The politics of local knowledge, Duke University Press, Durham, 2000) call to develop new ways of bringing citizens and experts together in governance, this paper examines an integrative sustainability governance system that uses both technocratic and deliberative procedures. Drawing on a case study of a Japanese consumer cooperative, Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative, this paper analyzes the ways that technocratic and deliberative governance procedures use different forms of knowledge, measure and assess sustainability differently, and produce different outcomes. The analysis finds that whereas technocratic forms of governance are most effective at monitoring, verification, and compliance assurance, deliberative processes facilitate relationships, mutual understanding, and commitment among stakeholders. For sustainability governance to address not only the technical but also social dimensions of sustainability, the findings on Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperatives integrative governance system support the need for deliberative procedures. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,,Credit Advancement; Jurisprudence; Legal Theory; Primary SACCOS; Theories of Regulation

In that perspective, this study discusses jurisprudential theories of regulation of financial cooperative societies in Tanzania with specific concentration to Primary SACCOS Credit Advancement (PSCA). The discussed theories are; natural law theory, social contract theory, command- and-control theory, sociological theory, law and economic theory, legal instrumentalism theory, and market failure theory. It is important to note however that, market failure theory is not yet adopted as a jurisprudential theory rather it is a general economic theory of regulation. It is therefore suggested in this study that, market failure theory is to be adopted as one amongst jurisprudential theories of regulation. Its adoption promises the better and conducive legal and regulatory framework for not only effectiveness of PSCA but also sustainability of other economic activities in the country. Because, market failure theory has an essential nature of positively impact changes from traditionally rigid and hyper-regulation form of legal and regulatory frameworks to more market friendly regulatory culture.

Structural behavior of frames build from Araucaria angustifolia glued boards and vegetable oil-based polyurethane adhesive was evaluated. Tests were carried out to characterize wood and adhesive to obtain verification/sizing parameters. Initially, a full-scale structural project was conducted to meet standard laying poultry house specifications. Afterwards, five units of straight three-articulated frames on a 1:2.5 reduced scale were designed, built, and subjected to strength tests until breaking. They were built with a 2-meter free span and a 15° slope, suitable for using metal roof tiles. The average for structure ultimate strength was 4.14 times the design load. Structures had satisfactory mechanical performance and displacements lower than those recommended by NBR 7190 (1997) standard (ABNT).

Also, the article discusses legal environment, government attitude and development trends of credit unions' in Poland. In conclusion, the de lege ferenda postulates regarding credit unions' regulation in Poland are presented. Credit unions in Poland conduct not for profit business activity only with their members with reservation to mediating in specific contracts on financial market which can be also conducted with nonmembers. Credit unions activity is subject to supervision of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (FSA). Therefore credit unions regulation is characterized by duality of legal regime of private and administrative law. However, in certain fields of credit unions activity the FSA's supervision, performed under administrative legal regime, raises justified doubts in the light of the principle of cooperative autonomy as the FSA by law has the authority to impose specific orders and prohibitions on credit unions. © 2020 University of Deusto.

The representative farms for each region were defined at meetings with sheep farmers and technicians via the rapid appraisal methodology and represent 65% of the states flock. The information of each representative farm was collected between March 2015 and February 2016. Principal component analysis was used to verify the relationships among the different variables that characterized the farms. These characteristics were: number of ewes (V1), total cost per kilogram of revenue-generating product (V2), feeding costs (V3), labor costs (V4), facility and equipment depreciation costs (V5), and gross margin in the production cycle (V6). Cluster analysis was performed, resulting in three distinct groups: one including eight, another seven, and the third, nine farms. The results aided in classifying the farms into groups with similar characteristics, such as production scale, reproductive efficiency, technical and managerial control, appreciation of cooperatives, and availability of continuous technical assistance. The production scale, reproductive and productive efficiency, adoption of technologies, and cooperative organizational structure can be emphasized as positive performance benchmarks and were the most important aspects to achieve positive economic results. © This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",,10.4197/Islec.33-2.6,Deposits; Financing services; Islamic banking

Critics assert that Islamic financial institutions are simply replicating conventional banks and ignoring Shar??ah teachings. There is a very critical rhetoric on Islamic banking practice, but this is expounded without examining the facts on the ground. In contrast, in this evidence-based investigation the activities of three leading Islamic banks are examined, Al Rajhi Bank, Maybank Islamic, and Meezan Bank. All three are found to have reputable scholars on their Shar??ah boards to ensure compliance with Islamic law. These institutions are incorporated as listed companies rather than being mutual or co-operative organizations as some Islamic economists advocate. Being a limited liability company ensures they can raise risk capital and conform to international regulations which are enforced by central banks. The three case studies reveal that the banks have been innovative in the deposit facilities offered as well as in their financing methods. Much of their financing is through leasing for vehicle acquisition and residential mortgages. Although focused on retail customers, the banks also provide commercial and investment banking services for companies and finance for small and medium sized enterprises. In summary, far from being broken, Islamic banks provide helpful financing for modern economies. © 2020.

The issue could arise where a group of producers of agricultural products gets together to form a cooperative or even where professionals in the same field get together in a partnership. On the face of it, each supply agreement between the producer and the cooperative or partnership is vertical, but the design of the collective rules, which govern for all, involves horizontal coordination. This article takes as the starting point the example of dairy cooperatives as they emerged in the later part of the nineteenth century as a solution to a challenge offered by new technology. We use the landmark contract law case of McEllistrim v. Ballymacelligott Cooperative to illustrate the ways in which competition law could be engaged when cooperatives are formed. Comparisons of Ireland and Denmark in the period leading up to the decision suggest that not only might the restraint be ancillary, but if not, it reduced costs, increased quality, and was welcomed by consumers (though these were in England rather than in Denmark or Ireland). The restraint also appears essential in some form, suggesting that either ancillarity or the application of Art. 101(3) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union would have allowed the restraint to be used. © The Author(s) 2020.",,10.14505/jemt.v11.8(48).21,Agricultural cooperative; Attitude; Farmer; Knowledge; Tourism destination

Data were then analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results show that perceptions of farmers toward the possibility of developing agricultural cooperatives through subak are within good category. When farmers have good perception, it is expected that the process of developing agricultural cooperatives through subak can be realized quickly and synergized with tourism businesses. © 2020, ASERS Publishing House.

Hence, alternative techniques must be explored. In this study, the use of rice straw as feedstock for a downdraft small-scale furnace to produce heated air for paddy drying was investigated. A two-level factorial experiment was initially implemented using differently conditioned rice straw types, rice straw feed rates, and drying airflow rates. Optimization results using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) showed there is no significant difference in the drying air efficiency using either loose or baled straw. The optimum conditions found were at a rice straw feed rate of 20.67 kg h?1 and drying airflow rate of 3.03 m3 s?1, resulting in a drying air efficiency of 86.1%, and an increase in drying air temperature of 18.41 °C which was sufficient for paddy drying applications. At the optimum conditions, the average CO and NOx concentrations measured inside the dryer simulator were 76.57 and 2.93 ppm, respectively. The results of this research can be used for pilot studies in actual agricultural cooperatives, as well as provide inputs to life cycle analysis. © 2019 The Author(s)",,10.1007/s12571-020-01070-7,Assessment; Determinant; Efficiency; Resilience; Response diversity; Scenarios

This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor. A truly resilient global food system implies not only preparedness for coming shocks and changes but also a foundation that makes shocks less probable and critical. © 2020, The Author(s).",,10.1016/j.cstp.2020.07.013,Capacity; Co-operation; Competitiveness; Financing; Inland navigation; Innovation

Inland navigation still is a sustainable mode of transport which is of great importance for the whole European transport market. However, due to its market structure, it risks losing the battle for volume and market share with the other transportation modes. Opting for inductive research approach, this paper first of all collects data. Next, the paper observes the market of the European inland navigation sector and looks for patterns in order to develop a set of structural pathways. From the data collection, it turns out that the sector is facing challenges, mainly due to overcapacity, uncontrolled costs and volatile freight prices. The classical reaction pattern to overcome these shortcomings (capacity control, cost control, playing with time and reliability factors) does no longer suffice. By analyzing the patterns, the researchers were able to formulate five pathways: A first path is that of technological/operational innovation or retrofitting for ecological and social sustainability. A second path is that of industrial economics: inland navigation is marked by a lot of fragmentation. A solution might be pooling up, whereby the risk of anti-competitive impacts seems very low. A third path is that of financing: the classical financing through banks clearly provides no incentive for reducing overcapacity, even not through bankruptcies. Actual lay-up of vessels seems a must. For longer-run financing, bonds, credit unions or even crowd-funding can be solutions. A fourth path builds on the second one, with more co-operation needed within the wider sector, also with vertically-related partners: charterers, terminal operators, etc. Fifth and finally, a dynamic regulation is needed, following modern rules, with an eye on the longer-term viability of the sector. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society",,10.1002/sd.1960,communal community; kibbutz; nearest neighbor; privatization; stratification; sustainability

We employed the nearest neighbor methodology to create pairs who were demographically eligible for a before and after comparison. Although our results about perceived sustainability suggest that kibbutzim across the board have overcome the struggle to survive and have been able to recover, unlike commonly assumed, changes they adopted in the direction of more privatization and diversified statuses are clearly correlated with smaller increases in levels of perceived sustainability.

A comprehensive assessment of co-operatives therefore requires an examination of non-conventional factors, in addition to the conventional factors. Three such non-conventional factors identified in the literature are 1)commitment, 2)heterogeneity and 3)social capital. Commitment is important for agricultural co-operatives because one pre-requisite for successful agricultural co-operatives is that farmer-members are willing to supply the co-operative with raw products, capital and managerial inputs. In this research affective, continuance, normative and other aspects of member commitment are examined. Heterogeneity is an important source of concern for co-operatives due to its impact on cohesiveness and collective decision making. This study used characteristics associated with the farmer-member and the farm-business to examine heterogeneity. It has been suggested that the social capital paradigm is the common denominator for all explanations and theories on co-operative formation and development. A modified version of the six dimensions framework used by the World Bank to assess social capital was used in this study. Based on this theoretical underpinning, a Three Dimensional Conceptual Framework, that encapsulates commitment, heterogeneity and social capital is developed and described. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1515/agriceng-2019-0025,diastatic power; extractivity; malt; malting barley; malting defects

The apparent resilience of Nordic democracy has sometimes been partly attributed to the strength of the popular movements, the internal democratic structures, and culture of these organizations and not least their role in educating their members in democratic practices. Drawing primarily on examples from the co-operative movements in several Nordic countries, the article asks how democracy was understood in co-operative societies and how it functioned in practice. Co-operative societies were committed to the principle of one member one vote, but faced constant dilemmas over how to combine the possibility for grassroots influence with the need for central control, especially as the organizations grew in size. In some cases, this led to irreconcilable conflicts and splits in central organizations. The article argues that although the co-operatives and other popular movements later came to be seen as crucial elements in the survival of Nordic democracy, their role in this survival should not be taken for granted. © The Author(s) 2019.",,10.1080/08039410.2019.1635523,bacterial wilt; collective action; group-based seed production; seed marketing; seed quality control
,performance behavior of corn smallholders for sustainable cooperative change in west kalimantan,Nurliza; Ruliyansyah A.; Hazriani R.,Agraris,2407814X,6,1,-,2020,"Department of Agribusiness, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta",,"In spite of many initiatives to set up community or farmer-group-based seed production, there is little empirical evidence about the group functioning in producing and marketing quality seed. This article therefore aims to contribute to better understanding of the process and practice of seed potato cooperatives formation and operation in Chencha, Ethiopia. Our study specifically focused on why and how farmer groups organize, produce and market quality seed potato. We collected primary data from two seed potato cooperatives in three phases through interviews, focus group discussions, and field assessment and store inventories on bacterial wilt incidence. We found that the support to the establishing of the two seed potato cooperatives focused more on improving the members seed potato production capacity and less on building good governance in the seed chain. The experiences showed the tensions between prescriptive rules, collective action and individual interests which made it very hard to maintain quality seed standards and friendship at the same time. In general, the root of having weak seed cooperatives may not be the lack of intent towards building durable farmer groups. Rather, development practitioners did not take the set-up of strong farmer groups as an evolving process, which continually engages in diagnosis and responds to the emerging social as well as material challenges. The set-up of farmer-group-based seed production, therefore, needs to shift from standard production models to an evolving model: an open and flexible model guided by trials, challenges and existing socio-technical and institutional realities. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, smallholders in farmer cooperatives are unsustainable because of the lack of decision-making power at the grassroots level; limited access to land, capital, technologies, information and financial services; low market competitiveness; weak management; and limited policy and socio-cultural norms. This research aims to construct the behavior model for performance change of cooperative farmers in Rasau Jaya, Kubu Raya district, West Kalimantan. It involved 75 smallholders recruited using purposive sampling technique. In-depth interviews using the structural equation modeling/SEM based on the new institutional approach and the theory of planned behavior were used in the study. The findings proved that intentions and past behaviors have positive and negative influence on farmers' cooperative behavior, but contradicted with control. Therefore, there are several efforts for changing the behavior in corn farmerscooperatives, i.e. the perceived behavioral control can stimulate the motivation to be long-lived performing based on the resources and opportunities; pro-environmental behavior needs to engage a supportive injunctive norm and a supportive descriptive norm; a subjective norm for motivation to exhibitthe positive experiential attitude; and the confidence to perform and control their performance. © 2021 Ecological Society of India.

I argue that the most effective response is to exit rather than attempt to overthrow capitalism and the hierarchical state by international revolution. Socialists in positions of authority in state institutions and capitalist enterprises can facilitate this process by enacting legislation that helps people to transition to new smaller-scale non-statist social units, such as producer-consumer co-operatives producing their own food and other essential services over time.

Design/methodology/approach: The data set used in this study comes from four SACCOS audited financial reports from the year 2010 to 2014 and from interviews with SACCOSs management. Findings: The study found that the IMFIs in Tanzania are not financially sustainable. Additionally, having responsible staff members, regular review of financial guidelines, education to members, cooperation between employees and management and staff training are found to be highly contributing factors towards SACCOSs financial sustainability. Moreover, the findings reveal that depending on the single source of income, i.e., charges on members contributed much in these SACCOSs not being financially sustainable. Research limitations/implications: Only two available registered Islamic SACCOS was used. Additionally, conventional SACCOS have been in service provision for a long time as compared to Islamic ones; hence, caution must be taken for comparison purposes. Practical implications: Based on these findings, the Islamic SACCOS needs to initiate productive projects that can enable them to have other income sources apart from charges on members. Originality/value: This study traces the financial trend of Islamic SACCOS in Tanzania since its establishment in 2010. Such trace enables Islamic SACCOS and other stakeholders to be aware on the financial progress of Islamic SACCOS and act accordingly to ensure sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103670,Governance structure; Mariculture Sci-Tech park; Performance; Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA)

A park consists of a core area and a radiation area. The core area includes a farm, a cooperative, or a company, and the radiation area consists of many small farmers. Stochastic frontier analysis is employed to analyze the performance and its influencing factors of different governance structures in mariculture Sci-Tech parks. Results indicated the following: 1) Core areas show diminishing returns of scale, indicating that the increase in the scale of mariculture production can decrease the output. 2) The average technical efficiency of the core area is 0.4728, with the large family farms having the highest (0.4907), followed by the mariculture companies (0.4777) and the fish farmer cooperatives (0.4499). Several reasons can explain the difference in technical efficiency. First, family farms can better apply the new technology and new varieties to the mariculture production through moderate scale management. Second, companies have a higher operating cost, and the construction of mariculture Sci-Tech park has little effect on companies' performance. Third, cooperatives' advantage is not obvious in the organization management and the repeated construction of the infrastructure decreases utilization. 3) When the radiation area is considered, the input of large family farms has the most significant impact on the performance of the entire Sci-Tech park, with the highest driving efficiency. However, the cooperatives' driving efficiency is very poor, and the company performance is only reflected in the capital investment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,10.46488/NEPT.2020.V19I02.043,Anthropogenic; Biodegradation; Enterobacter sp; Natural attenuation; RBRR; Textile effluent

Noteworthy is the fact that the textile industry utilizes enormous volumes of water for dyeing and printing unit operations thereby generating wastewater proportionately. Taking into consideration, implications of toxic textile effluents, a pilot study was planned to screen for naturally attenuated bacterial isolates capable of degrading textile effluents. Requisite effluent samples were collected from Kelki Printers Co-operative Society Limited, Sanganer, Jaipur and bacterial screening was carried out by bioaccumulation of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBRR) (formation of halo around colonies). Of the 19 bacterial isolates obtained, the most promiscuous isolate was biochemically characterized as Enterobacter sp. For biodegradative investigations, it was inoculated in sterilized textile effluent and incubated at 37°C for 7 days under agitating conditions. Pre and post bacterial inoculation (1% v/v), Physico-chemical parameters were analysed following standard procedures. A significant (p<0.05) lowering of pollution indicators was monitored when contrasted with abiotic control. The present study was aimed to explore the role of naturally attenuated and effluent adapted Enterobacter sp. screened from untreated textile effluent based on its colour (RBRR) removal efficacy under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, it was also explored for its biodegradative properties to minimize the level of potential pollution indicators through the microcosm approach.

The involvement of more cooperative societies in the multiplication and sales of stems should be encouraged. Integration of information and supply of various inputs is necessary. A group approach to extension delivery should be further promoted and the use of existing and new cultivars should be made popular through an extended or expanded cassava multiplication programme. Effective strategies are needed for stakeholders to share their experiences with those of other countries of the sub region who are participating in the processing of cassava.

Traditionally, they used to collect tasar cocoons from forest, keep them for moth emergence, mating and subsequently reared silkworm on forest based Asan or Arjun trees. Gradually, through research intervention economic plantations of host plants, tasar silkworm egg production and rearing methods were introduced. Simultaneously, Tasar Rearers' Cooperative Societies (TRCS), a unique system was developed in Odisha. However, for the production of basic eggs there was dependence on Central Silk Board (CSB). To make the farmers self sufficient in egg production and enhancing the cocoon production, CSB introduced Vanya Cluster Promotion Programme (VCPP) in two areas of Mayurbhanj, viz., Baincha-Jalghati and Thakurmunda-Kendujuani- Mahuldiha Vanya Clusters from 2016-17. A total of 160 farmers comprising of seed (egg) rearers, graineurs (egg producers) and commercial rearers were selected for study.

Literacy rate is also very low with 37.5% illiterate and 31.25 were below primary level. However, the technology adoption level by farmers is about 80%. So far as the base line survey is concerned there is significant increase in production as well as productivity of tasar cocoons as well as cocoon quantitative traits.

Design/methodology/approach: An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used. Findings: The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. Practical implications: The findings indicate that agricultural cooperatives can be a transmission route in the efforts to proliferate the adoption and diffusion of IPM technology, and increased IPM adoption tends to improve the economic performance of farm households. Originality/value: Despite the widespread evidence of health and environmental benefits associated with IPM technology, the adoption rate of this technology remains significantly low. This paper provides a first attempt by investigating to what extent and how agricultural cooperative membership affects IPM adoption and how IPM adoption influences farm economic performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.1080/14682761.2019.1689737,activism; campaign politics; community; thatcherism; Theatre

A response by working-class communities to the devastating effects of globalisation, rapid de-industrialisation, and mass unemployment, the theatres were a contribution to local and national campaigns. The essay sets out the political and social context in which the theatres arose, beginning with the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of a Conservative government in 1979. The key themes of what came to be known as Thatcherism, defined by a focus on free market economics, de-regulation, and attacks on trade unions and local government powers, are then detailed. These attacks gave rise to national and local resistance in the forms of strikes and campaigns, which provided the context for the emergence of Manor Campaign Theatre, the first of the tenants groups. The main body of the essay offers a narrative of the tenants theatres, their processes and organisation, and their role within campaigns around housing, welfare, credit unions, and water poverty.

Based on this background, a roadmapping process was conducted to assess the status quo and to identify measures to enhance the local food supply in the city-region of Graz in Austria. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 47 stakeholders, analysed textual materials and calculated food carrying capacities. The obtained data served as input for a series of three workshops, where measures were derived. Our results suggest that cooperation among agri-food stakeholders should be facilitated by local decision makers in order to promote food from regional sources within the target area. Furthermore, smart technologies can help to scale-up local food supply schemes, and to track down food stocks and flows more efficiently. Besides, food policy councils and open food labs can help to incubate food product innovations and to support partnerships among agri-food stakeholders, including local small-scale farmers.

There were huge differences in advisory flows, methods, and effectiveness according to types of AAS providers and production systems. Rice production received more technology transferred from CAC, CAB and irrigation companies as compared to aquaculture farming. Meanwhile, aquaculture sectors obtained more consultation from input dealers.

Further, empirical assessment of borrowing pattern of small-scale fishers is conducted by taking the case of ring seiners who constitute an important segment in the local fishery. The main determinants of their borrowing behavior from institutional credit sources are identified using a fractional logit regression approach. The findings point to continuing dominance of the informal financial sector over the institutional credit sector.

The study found that in Nicaragua, cooperatives selling to Walmart became unstable, in contrast with the performance of cooperatives selling to local supermarket chain La Colonia. The results show that cooperative performance is impacted by an interaction between differences in the types of farmers reached by the two supermarket chains, in the performance of the NGOs involved in each supply chain, and in the supermarkets business practices.

The results of the study witnessed that the Central Agricultural University, Imphal, the Department of Agriculture, Manipur and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare had high power and high interest in all the three districts along with Krishi Vigyan Kendra Imphal East, Krishi Vigyan Kendra Thoubal and the Regional Rice Research Station in Imphal East and Thoubal districts respectively. The farmers and the Farmer collectives were identified with high interest and low power while the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Regional Centre, Manipur and Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Imphal West remained with neutral power and interest in all the three districts. The Media comprising mainly of the All India Radio, Doordarshan Television and the local newspaper Sangai express has very low interest as well as power in all the three districts. Through these observations we conclude that stakeholders like farmers and farmer cooperatives who are the actual intenders of the technology with considerable level of interest should be involved into the system for effective planning, decision-making and successful functioning of the innovation system. ©2019 New Delhi Publishers.

Aiming to improve food quality and safety in the context of cooperatives, we introduced three categories of control measures: outcome control, process control and social control. Based on the Pre-Harvest Interval Standard (PHIS), we selected three indices, farmers implementation rate of PHIS, absolute distance to PHIS and relative distance to PHIS, to evaluate appropriateness of pesticides use, reduction of pesticide residue and safety improvements of agricultural products. By using random sampling survey data, we empirically analyzed the marginal effects of control measures and their combinations on food quality and safety standards. The empirical results show that implementing process control, namely, unified production standards or supply of unified agricultural inputs, can comprehensively improve farmers implementation rate of PHIS, absolute distance and relative distance to PHIS respectively by 34.9%, 3.2 days and 46.0% on average. While the effects of outcome control (safety inspection) and social control (bonus-penalty incentive or training) are restricted to other measures. Therefore, we suggest cooperatives should take farmers features, implementation conditions and the effects of control measures into consideration in order to make a sustainable management plan for improving food quality and safety and enhancing competitiveness in international markets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,10.5195/jwsr.2019.956,Anthropocene; Producer-consumer co-operatives; Socialist revolution; State; Transnational capitalist class

We find that there are three dominant ideological strands: sharing economy, commons, and platform cooperativism, within a spectrum that ranges from legitimizing neoliberalism and/or reasserting a reformist, more humane capitalism to more radical visions: cooperative society to commons-oriented production, and resisting privatization, through the recapturing of public space as commons.

South Korea, which is considered a representative success case of the late capitalist industrialization after the World War II, can be an important example to examine the relevance of this challenging perspective. Koreas economic success was largely determined by the NACF (National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation) lack of integrity: it was to be a voluntary and autonomous organization of farmers, but became a subordinate partner of the agricultural policy of the military government. The Saemaul (New Country) Movement developed by the government to promote rural innovations actually accelerated the decline of agriculture for it was used to control farmers. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Korean rural society was deeply dependent on the state power. At the same time, the farmers resistance developed as a reaction to the military government policies, and the NACF became the target of the farmers collective resistance movement. Thus, under the Park Chung Hees regime, Korean farmers were to participate in the national economy and become a part of the mandatory social-economic movement; however, they never managed to achieve a true class/collective political representation. © 2020, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

Despite the importance of gender equality as a tool for national economic growth gaining prominent attention, womens access to leadership and decision-making in cooperative societies remains under-researched. Design/methodology/approach: This study hinges on management and gender theories and systematic literature reviews. This study used a descriptive survey research design for primary data derived from a purposive non-random sampling technique that selected seven (7) active cooperative societies in Awka-South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Structured questionnaires were administered to the selected sample of 129 members. The hypotheses were analyzed using the T-test statistical model. Findings: This study revealed that social, legal, economic and cultural constraints affected womens participation in cooperative societies in Awka, Anambra State. Also, that the African-based culture and family traditions, patriarchal societal system, household responsibilities and homemaker roles, religious associations, certain strict cooperative entry requirements, limitation on womens access to resources and low paid wages and non-participatory training activities constrained the women. Therefore, the authors recommended that cooperatives should institute measures to encourage an increase in women members participation at the committee level and build their capacity own economic resources. Originality/value: This paper focuses on barriers that inhibit womens participation in cooperative societies with a particular focus on their opportunities and outcomes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.2478/cjf-2019-0020,Aquaculture; Cooperative society; Farmers; Growth; Profitability

This study examined the effect of cooperative financial intervention on the growth of catfish aquaculture value chain in Nigeria. Primary data collected, with well-structured questionnaire from 120 participants in aquaculture value chain, were analyzed with descriptive statistical tools, cost and return function and 4-point likert-type scale. The result shows that 32.3% and 27.3% of processors and input suppliers accessed N320,000 and N270,000, respectively. Only 18.2% of producers accessed N180,000. The result indicates that there are more catfish producers than any other operators in the value chain. There is interdependence between catfish producers and input suppliers, processors and marketers in the value chain. Furthermore, catfish processors and inputs suppliers accessed more cooperative loan because their activities were capital intensive. The relatively high amount of cooperative fund accessed by these groups translated high growth rate of 55% and 53%, respectively. The major constraints to the growth of catfish value chain were inadequate credit access and high expenditure on inputs. Operators in the catfish aquaculture value chain should be encouraged to attend workshops on management techniques to improve the efficiency of their businesses. © 2019 Theophilus Miebi Gbigbi et al.",,10.18461/ijfsd.v11i1.37,agricultural cooperatives; coffee; Fair trade; gender; supply chain

Inclusion of women in these institutions, however, does not guarantee a change in historical power relations, or the benefits that might flow from this. A transformative change in gender relations not only requires changes in women' s attitudes and capacities and in the relationships between men and women, but also progress at the institutional and structural levels, a topic which has been infrequently studied. To address this gap, this paper explores institutional perspectives of stakeholders in the supply chain of a fair-trade organic coffee federation located in the western highlands of Guatemala. Major themes emerged from the interviews regarding women' s inclusion in the industry, gender sensitization, women' s empowerment, and supply chain support. The study finds that empowering women as productive cooperative members requires not only technical assistance and support, but also creation of an inclusive social and political environment that supports expanded choices for women and men. The paper expands our understanding of the historical context and current institutional dynamics that are fueling gender transformative change in the coffee industry. The conclusions find that this type of approach may lead to more than just superficial gender integration, and has the potential to result in the genuine integration of women into previously male-dominated organizations and the eventual percolation of society-wide shifts in gender norms, moving towards a more equitable society. © 2020.

We explore decision-making in the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina, a highly territorial and also cooperative species. Here, we report a previously undescribed rescue behavior for weaver ants, and determine the role of distance and group membership in residents decisions to either rescue or attack conspecifics in distress. First, we tested if residents preferentially rescued nestmates and attacked non-nestmates. Our results show that rescue was more likely for nestmates; however, surprisingly, conspecifics from neighboring colonies were rescued in 43% of the distress trials. Furthermore, attacks became more frequent as distance between colonies increased showing a dear enemy effect, which may be explained by familiarity, odor recognition, and/or relatedness. Our work exploring the factors that influence the decision to rescue or attack provides novel evidence to understand the underlying selective pressures that shape decisions of cooperation or conflict in highly cooperative societies. © 2018, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",,10.11118/actaun202068010129,Oil and higher fatty acids content in rapeseed; Phosphorus and nitrogen nutrition of oilseed rape; Yield of rapeseed

Also effect of weather conditions was evaluated. The polyfactorial trial was realized in experimental years 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 in terms of agricultural cooperative in Mojmírovce. The experiment was based on three variants of fertilization treatments by the block method in three replications. The size of each block was created by plots with size 600 m2. The first level of treatment 10 was non-fertilized control. The second level of treatment 2U was fertilized by nitrogen in dose 240 kg.ha-1. The third level of treatment 3P was fertilized by the same dose of nitrogen 240 kg.ha-1 and by phosphorus in dose 88 kg.ha-1. The highest average yield 3.9 t.ha-1 was achieved at treatment 3P, where phosphorus was applied. It means statistically significant yield increase by 30% compared to treatment 2U, where no phosphorus was not applied. There was statistically non-significant difference in oil content, in the range of treatments. The content of oleic acid fluctuated from 63.3% to 65.9% and the highest was reached at unfertilized control treatments in both experimental years. The linoleic acid content ranged from 20.3% to 21.2% and content of linolenic acid varied between 6.9% and 8.9%. Application of nitrogen and nitrogen + phosphorus high statistically significant decreased oleic acid content in both experimental years. Opposite effect was observed, where content of linoleic and linolenic acid was high statistically significant increased after nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus fertilization. Effect of unequal weather conditions and treatments of nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus nutrition can influence the percentage ratio of higher fatty acids composition. © 2020 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno.

In this study, we surveyed rural areas about eight years after the LC was implemented by posted questionnaire and analysed the difference between farmers' and non-farmers' perceptions of the multifaceted evaluation items on the policy effect. The evaluation points for the LC include the following: [1] Impact on farming and farmland preservation, [2] Impact on community activation, and [3] Impact on collaboration between farmers and non-farmers. Results can be summarized as follows: First, it was confirmed that there is a trend for non-farmers' attachment to the area to be reduced because of LC. Second, non-farmers evaluations that LC attracts young farmers were also low. However, this opinion was much more noticeable in non-farmers who had quit agriculture recently than in the generation that had left agriculture because of LC. In other words, LC is a useful policy for improving agricultural conditions and agricultural structure. However, in some cases, the connections between farmers and non-farmers is weakened. Thus, cooperative activities to actively prevent this weakening are important. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.",,10.5267/j.msl.2019.11.034,Cooperative; Entrepreneurial orientation; Entrepreneurs

,director selection in agricultural cooperatives--the process and the roles in the finnish context,Huhtala K.; Tuominen P.; Tuominen T.,Cogent Business and Management,23311975,7,1,-,2020,Cogent OA,,"In the Nordic countries, agricultural co-operatives were important when family farmers organised to get access to the quickly developing markets during industrialisation in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These co-operatives were organised both as credit, insurance, processing and marketing co-operatives. Spreading at first from Denmark to the rest of Northern Europe and later reaching the new settler continent in North America, farmers co-operatives soon became a key element in private farming in market economies. As many co-operatives became large companies in the capitalist economies, they either became ordinary share companies, or retained their farmer-owned co-operative status like in Norway. After Marxist-inspired revolutions in Russia, China, Eastern Europe and later Vietnam and Cuba, state organised and government-controlled co-operatives were set up in socialist countries. Many of the old forms of agricultural co-operatives in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe collapsed when the centrally planned economies were abolished in the early 1990s. However, new forms of food production and distribution cooperation have emerged both in the capitalist and former socialist countries. These co-operatives were organised both among producers and consumers in order to meet the common needs of direct access to foods. While it is assumed that family farming and food markets will have to play a more important role in the Cuban food economy in the future, it will be interesting to see if small farmers in collaboration with wholesale co-operatives will be allowed to develop short and sustainable supply food chains, which could be competitive against state socialist and multinational capitalist agriculture. Cuban agricultural policy must be able to evolve along two strategies: a volume agriculture that delivers high-quality, durable basic foods to the predominantly urban population, but also delivers local traditional food with craftsmanship to tourists and a growing middle class. Both strategies will be necessary in order to address a historic challenge of the Cuban socio-economic development: to produce sufficient food and make it available to consumers at affordable prices, thus also saving scarce currency today spent on food imports. © 2020.

The results indicate that the director selection process and roles contain several paradox issues in two dimensions: administrative culture as well as the roles and authority of important actors. The paper contributes to the understanding of (1) mechanisms and relationships inherent in the process of director selection in agricultural cooperatives (2) the administrative culture as well as the roles and authority of the actors in the process and (3) paradoxes which help us to understand tensions in director selection under the requirement of fulfilling both the performance task and the conformance task. The paper discusses the results against the current board theories and suggests a new paradox dimension. It is suggested that director selection should be studied further from the perspectives of (1) implications of the use of authority and (2) the implications of the administrative culture. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Adaptation and mitigation strategies constitute the front line of attack for rural households in developing countries that rely on agricultural production and natural resource use as their main source of income and growth, and whose livelihoods are threatened by climate change. This study models the determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices by coffee producers in the department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua. Using primary survey data, we analyze the extent to which cooperative membership impacts adoption of ten different practices. We find that coffee farmers who belong to cooperatives have adopted sustainable practices at higher rates than non-members, and that the odds of adoption are higher for members than for non-members. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structural differences between the ten practices, and from this analysis three factors emerged and were modeled. We find that cooperative membership is a significant determinant of practices that promote water conservation, yet not significant for practices that promote soil and plant health, nor for practices related to field management. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors, and development and extension practitioners in the coffee sector, as they can better inform and guide policies toward more efficient and effective paths of long-term climate change adaptation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",,10.1016/j.qref.2018.02.001,Credit unions; Ethics; Islamic banks; Riba; Sharia'h

,the changing drivers of oil palm cultivation and the persistent narrative of 'already degraded land'. insights from nicaragua,Tittor A.,Journal of Rural Studies,7430167,74,,271-279,2020,Elsevier Ltd,,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse performance (on efficiency) of agricultural cooperatives in Mpumalanga province, South Africa, using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The empirical investigation is motivated by the dearth of empirical literature on agricultural cooperatives performance measurement and its correlates. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed DEA and applied the input minimisation constraint. The authors used the data from 19 agricultural cooperatives which had complied with reporting on their annual financial statements (AFS) in the financial year 2014/2015. The input variables were total assets and total expenses, and the output variables were revenue and profit. Findings: The average technical efficiency was found to be 72 per cent efficient indicating the presence of 28 per cent resource wastages. Of the 19 decision-making units, only 5 (26 per cent) were 100 per cent efficient. It should be noted that the 26 per cent that were technically efficient were also operating at constant returns to scale (optimal resource allocation). Research limitations/implications: Data limitation was with regard to 19 cooperatives, which means that if more agricultural cooperatives could be analysed, the results will be different. Practical implications: There are more than 60 agricultural cooperatives in the province, and yet only 19 could report on their AFS. This is an indication that there is a gap in governance, and policy makers and government need to revisit support, over and above funding, and issues of governance have to be strengthened. Social implications: Agricultural cooperatives are created as vehicles that can stimulate the economy and contribute towards job creation. If the cooperatives do not perform or are not sustainable, the socio-economic conditions of the communities in which they operate will never realise the economic gains. Originality/value: The study was necessitated by the continued focus on government based on the cooperatives, as there is a dearth of empirical literature separating managers reports and empirically proven studies/results. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.01.003,Bioenergy; Nicaragua; Oil palm; Political economy; Rural history
,multi-criteria measurement of sustainable innovativeness in farming organisations: evidence from lithuania,Drejeris R.; Miceikiene A.,Sustainability (Switzerland),20711050,10,9,-,2018,MDPI,,"The article explores the histories of oil palm in Nicaragua during the 20th century within a drastically changing Political Economy. In Nicaragua, palm oil cultivation dates back to the 1950s, when the United Fruit Company started to plant oil palm on the Atlantic Coast. In the 1980s, due to the agrarian reform of the Sandinista revolution, political conditions and economic strategies changed completely. In this era, a socialist government started to create agricultural cooperatives for oil palm. After the defeat of the revolution, during the neoliberal era of the 1990s, palm oil cultivation expanded in different surges. This expansion was tied to funding from international organizations, especially during the conjuncture of the bioenergy framework, which implied a new narrative of sustainability from the global level. The extent of the territory on which oil palm is cultivated more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2010, and again more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, although the Sandinista government was back in power and not particularly supportive of oil palm. The article argues that although the drivers, the main actors, their specific arguments, funding sources, and policies promoting oil palm have varied over time, the narrative of 'already degraded land' has consistently been used. Social contestations from below point not only to environmental and social consequences, but to the funding schemes and narratives of international institutions sponsoring and promoting oil palm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.3390/su10093347,Agriculture; COPRAS method; Farm innovation assessment; Multi-criteria assessment; Sustainable innovativeness

This article looks into the need for sustainable innovativeness assessment in agricultural business. To the best of our knowledge, farm sustainable innovativeness measurement has not been investigated in detail and no objective methodology for innovativeness assessment has yet been proposed. The objective of this article is to look into the possibility of using some methodology for measuring farm sustainable innovativeness and thus ranking farms based on this criterion. The article demonstrates the need for a multi-criteria method of innovativeness measurement and substantiates the complex proportional assessment method (COPRAS) as the most appropriate choice for addressing this challenge. The article presents the model of use of the proposed method and describes its practical application. The final result refutes the opinion that farm innovation depends only on possibilities of investing in a certain area. Indeed, staff creativity and the position of the management regarding certain areas of business make an essential contribution to the sustainable innovativeness level in the agricultural organisations. © 2018 by the authors.",,10.1108/IJPPM-10-2017-0250,Balanced scorecard; Performance; Supply chain management

Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires with 15 Likert scale. The sample consisted of the representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in Central Java Province, representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in West Java Province and some farmers who are members of those dairy cooperatives. This study uses balanced supply chain management scorecard for measuring the performance of dairy supply chain, importance-performance analysis (IPA) for identifying the indicators that are most in need of improvement, and strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) analysis for formulating strategic planning. Findings: The results of balanced supply chain management scorecard combined with IPA analysis showed that the performance relationship between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in West Java Province is slightly better than that in Central Java Province. It can be seen from the average value of the score of indicator, the category of each indicator and the category of the performance index of each relationship. The major weakness of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province lies in the different perspective (no perspective is dominant), whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer. On the other hand, the major strength of the relationship in Central Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer, whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of learning and growth. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of the dairy cooperatives as the sample and the type of scale used to measure the performance of the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and individual milk processors. So, the future research may replicate this study by surveying all the dairy cooperatives in Central Java and West Java Provinces. It may also enhance the measurement of the performance of the relationships by using a direct measure of each indicator in each perspective, rather than recording the management of dairy cooperative perceptions. Practical implications: This research provides essential insights for the management of dairy cooperative in the context of strategic planning development. The research reveals that there is a different strategic planning for improving the performance of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in each province. It depends on the major weakness and strength of the relationships, and also, opportunity and threat faced by the dairy industry. One important thing, the management of dairy cooperative in both provinces should have strategic planning related to the use of machine milking by farmers to improve the milk quality. Social implications: The research revealed that strategic planning could be built after analyzing the internal and external conditions carefully. It may encourage more dairy cooperatives to measure and analyze the internal and external conditions at the bottom of strategic planning of their business. Originality/value: Although this research only used the balanced supply chain management scorecard and IPA analysis for measuring the performance, and SWOT analysis in formulating the strategic planning for improving the current performance, it will make a difference. First, instead of measuring the performance of dairy cooperatives, this research measured the performance of the relationships between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors. This way, the dairy cooperatives were only sources of data collection. Second, the investigation was quite complicated since the objects of the research were represented by the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.5430/ijfr.v10n2p121,

However, they also face number of challenges which may affect their performance. Most of the previous studies in the area of SACCOS did not concentrate on their performance. The aim of this study therefore was to assess performance of SACCOS in Maseru District, Lesotho. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design where data were collected at one point in time. A sample size of 369 respondents was computed by the use of formula by Yamane (1967). Respondents in the sample were selected by using simple random sampling technique. However, respondents from individual SACCOS were proportional to the total number of members in particular SACCOS. This was done in order to make the sample representative of all SACCOS in the study area. Analyses of data were done by using different techniques which include: mathematical equations (i to vii); different financial ratios; tables; graphs; bar charts and other types of descriptive statistics like mode and percentages. It was found that socio economic characteristics of members were supportive to financial performance of the SACCOS. Furthermore, SACCOS in the study area achieved high performance in terms of ratios of members' capital; loan delinquency; volumes of savings in the SACCOS; and growth of total assets. On the other hand, the SACCOS realised poor financial performance in terms of ratio of fixed assets to total assets; and share capital owned by members. © 2019, International Journal of Financial Research.",,10.5836/ijam/2018-07-68,Balanced scorecard; Causal map; Cooperative; Corporate social responsibility; Strategic management; Systemic approach to change

It was evident in the research that there is a problem that is repeated in other researches carried out on the subject, which is the measurement of assets at fair value. It was also noted that the explanatory notes of the cooperatives analyzed do not generally provide detailed information on their biological assets, and therefore are insufficient for understanding the situation of these assets, which in some way compromises the decision-making of users interested in this information. © 2019, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

To validate the model a set of gasification experiments were performed in a 250 kW quasi-industrial gasifier. The cold gas efficiency of the th gasifier and tar production were evaluated to assess the energy potential of olive pomace while determining its most suitable end-use applications. A techno-economic analysis addressing the comparison of two different commercially manufactured gasifying unit sizes (100 kW and 1000 kW) and a Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis were employed to assess both the feasibility of each application size and also foresee the main investment risks in conducting olive pomace gasification in small rural facilities. Olive pomace gasification showed to be more suitable for personal household purposes. The low cold gas efficiency (around 20%) makes this producer gas more appropriate for small cogeneration facilities applications. The use of olive pomace residues in gasification showed viable economic performance in small cogeneration solutions at a scale of 1000 kW for agriculture waste-to-energy recovery in olive oil agriculture cooperatives, while 100 kW showed to be unable to reach an economically sustainable scenario. Final remarks point out that despite the feasibility of the venture at a scale of 1000 kW special concerns must be considered regarding the study attractiveness to potential investors. © 2019 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.",,10.17170/kobra-20190613561,Cardamom; Cocoa; Infrastructure; Smallholdings; Sustainable rural livelihood; Vanilla

However, AF seems to have adoption problems due to external market forces, lack of skills, financial resources and know-how ending in low flexibility and discontinuity of farmers in practicing AF. The objective of this study is to identify social, institutional, and economic factors that influence the adoption of AF on the household and community level, taking the region Alta Verapaz in Guatemala as a case study. Alta Verapaz is amongst the poorest regions in the country but also a tropical biodiversity hotspot where current agricultural practices are threatening forest environments and social development objectives. Our study explores how capital accessibility and institutional incentives are related to farmers livelihood sustainability and AF compositions. The methodology is composed by semi-structured interviews with nineteen farmers and field observations. The interviews have been analysed based on a qualitative content analysis by using the inductive category development. Based on these outcomes, the study found that human and economical capitals are favoured in communities were institutions are present especially through AF training offers, creation of farmers cooperatives and economic incentives. The role of institutions resulted to be crucial in the promotion of organic AF methods, forest protection and creation of long-term income. The combination of agricultural diversification with institutional incentives is one key livelihood strategy adopted by the farmers in order to achieve a socio-economic and ecological sustainability of their households. The further promotion of community forestry projects, expansion of networks and ongoing agricultural trainings as well as the diversification of agricultural systems could be beneficial for farmers in Alta Verapaz. © Author(s) 2019.",,,Coffee farmers; Fair trade; Linear regression; Perceived economic performance; Social capital

The primary contribution of this paper is the analysis of whether FT impacts the dynamics of the different SC dimensions. This study used both quantitative and qualitative techniques. I surveyed 97 farmers from Atok (fair trade supplier) and 96 farmers from Tublay (non-fair trade supplier). Also, I conducted focus group discussions of 8 to 10 members from each group and in-depth interviews with formal and informal leaders and key-informants (buyer and local government leaders). The t-test revealed that the farmer cooperative that supplies to FT organization has a significantly higher tendency to ask support from non-government organizations (NGO) and financial institutions. Likewise, they have a higher score in collective action and perceived economic performance. Additionally, regression analysis showed that trust in local government unit (LGU), empowerment, and cooperative classification are positive predictors of perceived economic performance while trust in NGO and membership expansion have negative effects on perceived economic performance. © 2018 by De La Salle University.",,,Agricultural cooperative; Cooperative financial ratio; Cooperative performance; Financial performance; Rubber cooperative

The results revealed that characteristics of rubber cooperatives were divided into primary and secondary businesses. Four rubber cooperatives obtained the highest revenue from gathering rubber products as primary business, accounting for 50 percent of all rubber cooperatives, covering 22.53 million (THB.) per year. Regarding secondary business, two rubber cooperatives generated the highest revenue by supplying and selling fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, and processing rubber products accounting for 4 million (THB) per year. Seven cooperatives (87.5%) had acceptable financial performance ratios. This finding implied that these cooperatives were successful in terms of operation. The ability of rubber cooperatives to meet current obligations and the use of resources were effective. In contrast, only one cooperative investing in rubber processing gained an unacceptable financial performance ratio which was below than 2. The Acid-test (-0.17) demonstrated rubber cooperative dependency upon inventory. Additionally, the inventory turnover ratio was excessively high. There was much invested in rubber processing, machinery, and equipment.

Our study investigates the socio-economic performance of a community-based initiative that uses cooperative-driven organic certification of honey producers in Mwingi, Eastern Kenya, to improve livelihoods and acacia woodland management. Data were collected through a household survey of 303 beekeepers from 38 organic certified and 16 non-certified beekeeper groups. More data were collected using key informant interviews, informal conversations, participant observation, participatory rural appraisal, internal document reviews and secondary sources. The survey included questions regarding beekeepers' livelihood activities, organisation involvement, quantity of honey produced and sold, net honey income and welfare perceptions after certification (2015) and before certification (2008), retrospectively. The results showed minimal to no significant impacts of certification on households' incomes, honey quantity or sales prices, as the general development, though positive, followed that of the non-certified households. The lack of impacts stemmed from failure to monitor and technical backstopping of certified beekeepers, a poor cooperative management and mistrust among the members and Mwingi organic cooperative board. The board mainly bought honey from a non-certified middleman thereby undermining the Mwingi organic cooperative's values as well as their own potential niche market. On a positive note, the cooperative's honey market place, receiving customers from afar, has the potential to support the development of a niche organic market outlet. However, this requires reconnection of the cooperative to its members, trust rebuilding and transparent management of the cooperative. The study exemplifies a case of community-based livelihoods-conservation initiative which did not take local community capacity development and more general long-term project sustainability into consideration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.22201/FCA.24488410E.2020.2448,Cooperative principles; Financial performance; Savings and credit cooperatives; Social responsibility

We discuss 56 peer-reviewed publications to illustrate the main findings and conclusions while outlining challenges and opportunities for future research. Generally, cooperative membership is found to positively impact price, yield, input adoption, income, and other indicators of member performance, yet there is growing evidence of an uneven distribution of benefits for small and large producers. In terms of structure, evidence of a causal relationship of ownership and governance to performance has been elusive, yet there are now many findings of inherent equity and long-term debt constraints, often in the context of consolidation to drive scale and scope economies. Further inefficiency is observed to be driven by increased heterogeneity in member attitudes and objectives, in particular in terms of commitment and participation. Thus, overall, empirical work portrays farmer cooperatives as flawed and complex business organizations which nonetheless have a strong positive impact on its members.

The country has favorable conditions for the development of agricultural sector. Despite urbanization processes in recent years, about half of Georgian population still lives in rural areas and most of them are employed or self-employed in this sector. Therefore, the level of development of agriculture in the country impacts the lives of significant share of the countrys population. Agriculture has been paid more attention by the government of Georgia in recent years. In particular, various programs and projects have been initiated and implemented in this direction. These programs aim at encouraging the development of various agricultural activities as well as development of processing industry, which will lead to increasing production and export of Georgian agricultural products. However, currently, development of agricultural sector in Georgia significantly lags behind other sectors of the economy mainly due to insufficient financing of this sector, lack of access to relevant technologies and lack of development of processing industry for raw agricultural materials. Therefore, a number of measures, like scientific-research activities, increasing the awareness of farmers, introduction of technological novelties and improvement of agro-insurance system that will enhance the competitiveness of the sector still need to be implemented. © 2019 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

New generation cooperatives, characterized by substantial supply and equity requirements, inspired much farm producer optimism before revealing weaknesses and limitations in the early 2000s. In response, recent innovations in US cooperative state law introduced the limited cooperative association (LCA), a new legal entity allowing joint ownership by member patrons and member investors to facilitate large-scale equity acquisition. However, business registration data indicate few such organizations have been formed in the agri-food industry. The LCA is adopted by several small-scale operations in niche markets such as lamb, elderberry, and non-GMO seed, but there is not much interest among business organizations in the commodity sector. This paper raises possible explanations for the limited adoption of the LCA, including the competing objectives of farmers and investors, the ambiguous legal interpretation of investor objectives, the superiority of other legal structures, and the lack of strategic advantages. The conclusion facilitates an invitation to further study the challenging future of farmer cooperatives in the agri-food industry. © 2018, The Author(s).",,10.1080/17449359.2019.1660682,agriculture; co-operative; computer production; CZ planned economy; decision premises; sideline production; Social system

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon nine in-depth interviews and naturalistic observations in an urban village of Guangzhou, China, the study empirically investigates how unregulated sidewalk-based hawkers struggle to survive against socioeconomic adversities compared with regulated vendors operations in a legitimate transitional market. Findings: Mirroring a sub-group of rural-to-urban migrants, street vendors espouse subtle strategies centering on purposefulness, resourcefulness and hardiness, which are instantiated through family obligation, sales tactics, merchandising techniques, technology application, trading flexibility, moral sentiment and assistance network. As such, street entrepreneurs are both enacting and constructing resilience in response to specific challenging contexts including impoverishment, operating cost inflation, contingent loss, fierce competition, market uncertainty, intensive workloads, municipal inspection and arbitrary governance practice of village cooperative organization. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding its limited generalizability, the result sheds light on crystallization of street vendors resilience and informs social services and policy remedies. Originality/value: The study provides a frame of reference to examine the interplay of resilience theory from psychology and entrepreneurship thesis from the field of business management by adding new evidence to the research on entrepreneurial resilience and potentially serves as a catalyst to enrich existing literature with an integrated perspective to comprehend the coping process of these necessity-driven micro-enterprise operators. The antagonistic understanding of informal economy is so predominating that it obscures structural oppression undermining social justice, whereas the spirit of self-reliance among street entrepreneurs is ought to be respected. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.17138/TGFT(7)519-526,Biomass yield; Chemical composition; Economics; Substitution effects

Twenty-five intact Washera male lambs were used in both a 90 day feeding trial and a 10 day digestibility study. The treatments compared were: 100% PH (control, = T1); PH + a concentrate mix (CM) (= T2); PH + HGF barley (= T3); PH + HGF oats (= T4); and PH + 50% CM and 50% HGF mixture of barley and oats (= T5). Chemical composition of diets and refusals, feed intake and digestibility of DM and nutrients were recorded. The average HGF fresh biomass yields from 1 kg grain were 5.21 and 6.32 kg for barley and oats, respectively. The CP, NDF, ADF and ADL concentrations in HGF were 13.2, 45.6, 34.8 and 6.7% for barley and 13.7, 46.8, 36.6 and 7.6% for oats. All supplemented treatments had higher total DM intakes (12-21%) than the control (P<0.05) and all supplements produced marked substitution effects for PH (35-51%). Animals on the PH diet lost weight (17 g/d), while all supplemented groups gained weight (58-65 g/d). Partial budget analysis showed that the highest net return was for T5 followed by T2, T4 and T3. Hydroponically-grown oats forage could have potential to replace a commercial concentrate for supplementing sheep on native pastures, but both HGF and concentrates are probably unaffordable for the majority of smallholder farmers engaged in sheep production. Establishment of farmer cooperative hydroponic facilities could spread the overhead costs of the capital infrastructure and this approach should be investigated. © 2019.",,10.5430/rwe.v10n5p129,Co-operatives; Management accounting practices; Managerial performance

The study draws on environmental communication theory, the theory of the coordinated management of meaning, and Vandana Shivas three-tiered economic model to construct a communication-based framework through which to view farmers stories about sustainability. This framework is productive, showing how some Nuevo Mexicano farmers (and others) orient toward farming, sustenance, and human-nature relationships through community, family, heritage, and education. Moreover, in addition to a conceptualization of sustainability as specific practices for nurturing and enduring in environments, communities, and organizations/institutions, sustainability can be understood as embedded ecocultural and historical experience with cross-cultural parallels in land-based communities.

A widespread intervention is the construction of agro-pastoral dams and irrigation schemes in traditionally pastoral communities that face a drying climate. Taking the Maji Moto Maasai community in southern Kenya as a case study, this article demonstrates that water access inequality can lead to a breakdown of pre-existing social capital and former pastoral cooperative structures within a community. When such interventions trigger new water uses, such as farming in former pastoral landscapes, there are no traditional customary institutional structures in place to manage the new water resource. The resulting easily corruptible local water management institutions are a main consolidator of water access inequalities for intervention beneficiaries, where socio-economic standing often determines benefits from interventions. Ultimately, technological adaptation interventions such as agro-pastoral dams may result in tensions and a high fragmentation of adaptive capacity within target communities. © 2018 by the authors.",,10.1093/bjsw/bcx071,Community kitchen; Disaster social work; Green social work; Participatory Action Research; Post-disaster community reconstruction; Spatial justice

The Lushan earthquake damage is less than the 2008 Wenchuan earthquakes, where 70,000 houses collapsed and 2 million people across nineteen prefectures and 115 counties of Sichuan province were affected. Temple Village (fictitious name), an old village in S township, was chosen as an intervention site. As most young adults went to work in the city, the old community became dilapidated and its traditional culture, architecture, custom, skill and wisdom were dying. Social workers were unable to tackle fully this communitys multiple needs, especially those associated with environmental and physical spaces linked to notions of belonging and identity, on their own. A transdisciplinary action research team in which social workers operated hand in hand with the disciplines of architectural design became the means for exploring an alternative model of post-disaster community reconstruction that would enhance the quality of life of left-behind people in this disaster-affected community. Working together, the research team facilitated the formation of a community kitchen project that enabled villagers to create a new building and co-operative organisations for the villages long-term sustainable development.

We make novel contributions to the literature by employing a recently developed selectivity-corrected stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to address possible self-selection biases stemming from both observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that TE for cooperative members ranges from 79 to 86 per cent and that for non-members ranges from 74 to 84 per cent, depending on how biases are controlled. In addition, the efficiency levels of both members and non-members of cooperatives appear to be underestimated if the selectivity bias is not appropriately addressed. Our findings conclude that the average TE is consistently higher for cooperative members relative to their counterparts, highlighting the positive role of contemporary agricultural cooperatives in promoting efficient usage of production inputs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1007/s10699-018-9563-1,Autocatalytic organization; Chemical evolution; Cooperation barrier; Evolutionary transitions; Managed-metabolism; Origins of life

This dynamical barrier prevents un-managed autocatalytic networks of molecular species from individuating into complex, cooperative organizations. The barrier arises because molecular species that could otherwise make significant cooperative contributions to the success of an organization will often not be supported within the organization, and because side reactions and other free-riding processes will undermine cooperation. As a result, the barrier seriously impedes the emergence of individuality, complex functionality and the transition to life. This barrier is analogous to the cooperation barrier that also impedes the emergence of complex cooperation at all levels of living organization. As has been shown at other levels of organization, the barrier can be overcome comprehensively by appropriate management. Management implements a system of evolvable constraints that can overcome the cooperation barrier by ensuring that beneficial co-operators are supported within the organization and by suppressing free-riders. In this way, management can control and manipulate the chemical processes of a collectively autocatalytic organization, producing novel processes that serve the interests of the organization as a whole and that could not arise and persist in an un-managed chemical organization. Management self-organizes because it is able to capture some of the benefits that are produced when its interventions promote cooperation, thereby enhancing productivity. Selection will therefore favour the emergence of managers that take over and manage chemical organizations so as to overcome the cooperation barrier. The managed-metabolism hypothesis demonstrates that if management is to overcome the cooperation barrier comprehensively, its interventions must be digitally coded. In this way, the hypothesis accounts for the two-tiered structure of all living cells in which a digitally-coded genetic apparatus manages an analogically-informed metabolism.

Commentators suggested that co-operatives, in particular credit unions, could provide accountability and sustainability through their open governance and mutual status. However, such suggestions assumed that co-operative principles and practice continued to underpin the efficacy of co-operative banking, and that credit unions, one of the most prevalent forms of co-operative banking, could offer a viable financial alternative. Instead, in the case of Cyprus, the financial crisis and the associated aftershocks triggered the nationalisation and demutualisation of credit unions. This prompted the researchers to question both the viability of a co-operative banking future and the extent to which co-operative principles were shaping decision making, governance, accountability and sustainability. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was adopted to explore the degree to which co-operative principles still shaped credit union thinking and stakeholder relationships. Findings: As is the case elsewhere within the co-operative movement, the findings point the fact that governance is weaken by the low membership participation and that the principles are no longer universally applied. Credit unions, if not co-operative banking, may not offer the financial assurances that commentators have called for. Moreover, the guiding principles may no longer be embedded within the fabric of the movement. Practical implications: Findings are important for practitioners/supervisory body as they highlight possible impacts on co-operative future and especially on their governance model and level of autonomy and independence in case of state intervention. Originality/value: The research undertaken is original as it is the first time credit unions in Cyprus were examined for adherence to co-operative principles. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.18542/rmi.v13i20.9347,Public policies; Sociobiodiversity; Territorial development

Cooperatives play a crucial role in promoting bulk storage and sale by smallholder farmers, which can play a major role in poverty reduction for farmers otherwise unable to commercialize. Despite the significant role of cooperatives, the reforms associated with economic liberalisation have caused many cooperatives in the region to fail. While efforts were made in Uganda to ameliorate this situation through the passing of the National Co-operative Policy (NCP), this has done little to enhance the survival of these cooperatives. In this opinion paper, we identify challenges faced by cooperatives that negatively impact performance and survival, such political interference, lack of administrative support, human resource constraints, inadequate knowledge of the operations by members and poor governance.

For this research, a questionnaire was used to collect information on soil management and the use of agricultural terraces. Data collection was completed with 145 landowners and NTS users, along with rural extension and agricultural cooperatives. The results demonstrated that the return of erosion is likely due to the absence of crop rotation in favor of repetitive year-to-year planting of the same plant species (early soybean/maize [second harvest]/wheat), soil revolving to decompress the surface layer, and the elimination of agricultural terraces and the consequential downslope planting. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade?offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 20132015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.5513/JCEA01/20.2.2010,Heracleum mantegazzianum; Invasive plant species; Mapping of occurrence; Population dynamics

This toxic invasive plant prefers drier agricultural fields or grasslands. The aim of this paper was to study the distribution and population dynamics of H. mantegazzianum and to evaluate its management measures taken in the town of Spiská Stará Ves in the Kemarok district located in northern Slovakia. H. mantegazzianum has successfully spread in the cadastral area of Spiská Stará Ves in the buffer zone of the national park of Pieniny. The total area of the PIENAP and its buffer zone invaded by H. mantegazzianum was approximately 457,000 m2. The research took place in 2013, on an area colonized by the species (28,900 m2) located on the land of the former agricultural cooperative farm. The taxon has spread mainly on abandoned areas (64.7% of the total area occupied by H. mantegazzianum), on permanent grasslands (28%) and along the banks of the Dunajec river (7.3%), where it formed polycenoses with a group dispersion. The population density of H. mantegazzianum decreased by about 46% on the research sites after the management measures provided in July 2013. It can be concluded that the management measures were poorly effective, because as evidenced by of the area occupied by the species. © 2019, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

Seonheul 1-ri built a community based on ""Dongbaekdongsan"" owned by Jeju-do and the central government, while Gasi-ri built a community based on a common pasture owned by a farm association. In comparing these two cases, this paper will discuss how the difference in ownership modes affected the community building and commons management methods. This paper shows that a village's ownership of the commons may paradoxically interfere with the formation of a stable commons management body in some cases. Whereas the farm cooperative association, of which the members are 270 village residents, has the ownership of the common pasture in the case of Gasi-ri, the central government owns ""Dongbaekdongsan"" in the case of Seonheul 1-ri. Although both villages successfully built communities, in the case of Gasi-ri, the members of the village council, which is the commons management body, are divided into association members and non-association members. In the case of Seonheul 1-ri, all members of the village are equal in their statuses in the village council since there is no farm cooperative association with the ownership of commons. Therefore, the community of Seonheul 1-ri has a good structure for immigrants to settle into. The non-association members who have actively participated in community building in Gasi-ri are leaving, and thus the population of Gasi-ri is stagnant. On the contrary, the population of Seonheul 1-ri is increasing rapidly as the number of immigrating residents grows. Even when the village manages the commons, conflicts can be amplified in cases where some of the residents, or the association to which some but not all of the residents belong, owns the commons. Due to the inequality between persons with and without ownership, the managing body of the commons can become unstable. To stably promote community building, the commons should be owned by the village or the villagers rather than by outsiders, an enterprise, or the state. However, even when the village or the villagers have the ownership of the commons, if there is inequality among village residents around the commons it may interfere with community building or the maintenance of the sustainability of the commons. On the contrary, if the commons is expropriated by the government and the right of the village to stably manage the commons is guaranteed although the village does not have first-hand ownership, a community can be built and the sustainability of the commons can be maintained for a long time because the residents are equal. To manage the commons effectively to remain sustainable hereafter, village residents should be continuously filled, and to this end the village council should have an equal and open structure. © 2015 The Institute for Social Development and Policy Research.",,,Agriculture; Archival collection; Archives; Collectivisation; Cooperative

The correspondence analysis has confirmed the existence of high inertia within groups of economic and social motives as well as the highest importance for financial reasons. Multiple correspondence analysis identifies differences in response patterns of evaluating the influence of motivational factors. Better market placement is the main reason for joining cooperatives among respondents with full ownership rights having fewer than ten years of experience and lower income from agriculture. The respondents with higher income from farming or cooperation were more motivated to reduce production costs unlike the respondents with more moderate income. © 2018, Bononia University Press.

The pest infestation levels, damage ratings, and yield losses vary within and among countries because of differences in millet cultivars, the planting period, the onset time and seasonal distribution of rains, synchronization of moth flight with head development stages, and pest control practices. Egg laying by moths and the distribution of larval populations are governed by the development stages of millet head and the soil type. Rainfall patterns affect the distribution of diapaused pupae. The implications of this information for future pest control strategies are discussed in this review. Control measures including the planting of pest tolerant/resistant cultivars, the application of chemical pesticides, and the abundance of natural enemies have had significant impacts on larval mortality but have limited application. In recent years, augmentative releases of the larval ectoparasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), have been tested in a pilot project in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. Because of the success of the program and the increasing demand for parasitoids farmers cooperatives are being engaged in producing parasitoids for the large-scale distribution of 'ready-to-use' bags containing braconids. This would sustain continuous availability and generate profitable businesses. To achieve this goal, farmers' economic problems and technical challenges need to be resolved at the village level, and marketing avenues need to be established. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

This is particularly true in Italy, a Mediterranean country with a strong agricultural tradition and a great interest in the food market. The largest market weight in terms of food retail in Italy is held by national chains linked to the cooperative movement (Coop and Conad) that has promised to ensure more collaborative and less imbalanced relationships between producers and distributors, along with a stronger connection to the territory and socially responsible corporate management. The Coop is currently the biggest cooperative in Italy. Its increasing power in the Italian food retail system has caused it to behave like an oligopoly that has exploited its proximity to left-wing parties to obtain an advantageous position in some markets (ex: Emilia, Liguria, etc.). Equally alarming is a growing financialization which has led to the bankruptcy of CoopCa and Coop Operaie of Trieste, affecting approximately 20,000 investors.

The results revealed that Khao Hin Sorn Agricultural Cooperative Rice Mill Ltd. is royal patronage which is supported by various agencies such as the Cooperative Promotion Department, and Land Development Department. This cooperative collected paddy from 10 farmer members, with average amount of paddy at 14 tons per year, and the paddy were delivered to the cooperative rice mill for processing. The full mill capacity is 1.2 ton of paddy per day. The service charge rate is one Thai baht per kilogram. The cooperative has produced rice in both packaging and non-packaging for sale to consumers by themselves. Regarding the SWOT analysis results, concerning the strengths, the cooperative rice mill was royal patronage that can provide inexpensive milling service charge for farmers. Additionally, operation staff had experience in rice milling for a long time. Whilst the weaknesses were the rice mill without checked the quality of paddy before milling-process and did not have the specialized technicians to repair a milling machine as well as budget deficit. In terms of the opportunities, the rice mill had a wide range of support from organizations of budgeting, staff, and administration. Moreover, farmers was preferred consuming rice grown by their own. Finally, the threats were the rice mill which located in a non-rice-farming area, and it operated less than the full milling capacity.

This paper targets at exploiting factors predicting the way that farmers use chemical input, based on first-hand data from 145 vegetable farmers with the membership of cooperatives in China. The role of social capital is investigated beyond traditional determinants. There are three indicators of social capital adopted in this paper, communication of technology and market information, trust, and members awareness of common goals. We identify three ways of chemical input use in field investigation. They are using chemical input according to own experience and the instruction on the package, under the guidance of the government, and under the guidance and monitoring of cooperatives. The findings of empirical analysis highlight the role of social capital in influencing the way farmers use chemical input. The awareness of common goals incentivizes farmers to use fertilizer under the guidance of the government and cooperatives, while all the three aspects of social capital are significantly associated with the way that farmers use pesticide. To be specific, farmers in a cooperative with a higher level of communication, trust, and common goals display the tendency to using chemical input based on external guidance rather than own experience. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.24215/15155994e059,Agricultural cooperatives; Brasil; Professional profile; Rural extension

One approach hereby is to use multi-stakeholder innovation systems, such as the Nicaraguan Learning Al-liance (NLA). However, tools for the evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems are rare. This paper reports on the implementation of a conceptual framework to carry out an impact evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems using the NLA as the object of study. The assessment focused on the business relationship constructs of trust and capacity development. Survey interviews, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions collected data from agribusiness stakeholders linked with the NLA and from a control group of stakeholders involved with other networks. The quantitative data were analysed through factor and regression analyses. Results from the quantitative analyses were triangulated with qualitative data. The analysis shows that the NLA has been successful in developing smallholder farmers capacities as a result of trust developed through its dedicated project managers. Nonetheless, the NLA has not been more successful at developing agribusiness capacities among Nicaraguan farmers than other networks with the same goals. Results from this study point to the need for facilitating more interactions between the different networks of farmers cooperatives and organisations with other stakeholders already active within the Nicaraguan agrifood innovation system. © 2018, Kassel University Press GmbH.

Like traditional security spaces around the world, global cyberspace is also an anarchy system with no absolute authority or institutional status. In such a situation, based on cyber sovereignty and cyber power, the state tries to create an institution applicable to domestic and international cyberspace to make a cyber system favorable to the state itself. Since, unlike traditional power, cyber power has both material and non-material elements, a state cannot know the level of another state's cyber power. For this reason, conflicts among states in the cyber domain are intensifying. The most active states competing for the upper hand in cyberspace are the United States and China. They lead to different levels of recognition and strategies concerning the cyber domain. While the competition between the United States and China invites conflict, it also triggers temporary cooperation among states. The UN's cybersecurity activities are also fragmented by various inter-government institutions and management organizations. However, the differences in strategy between the United States and China affect other states. Ultimately, although the direction of discussions on cybersecurity has been set based on the Group of Government Experts activities in the UN and the need for inter-state cooperation has been acknowledged, such cooperation would be only temporary because states consider domestic policy and strategy to be more important than international or regional cooperative organizations. © 2017 Center for International Studies, Inha University",,10.1016/j.chieco.2017.07.009,"Certification; Food safety; Informant asymmetry; Inspection; Non-separable model; One household, two production systems"

Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called One Farm Household, Two Production Systems (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years. This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for famers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow Green Food are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides. © 2017",,10.1590/1808-057x201704740,Adjustment to present value; Cooperatives; IFRIC 2; Quotas; Share capital

We do not aim to provide definitive solutions by exhausting all conceptual analyses and accounting alternatives involving the reclassification of member shares, or quotas, from net equity to liabilities, but rather to present some considerations with regards to points that are not explicit in ICPC 14. Applying the concept of adjustment to present value (APV) is the main point of this study, which was not taken into account when ICPC 14 was elaborated. Analysis of the statutes of cooperatives indicates, as a common characteristic, the obligation to always pay the redemption of members' quotas in a period of more than one year, and this leads us to conclude that for a reliable representation of the phenomenon it is necessary to recognize the APV of this reclassified liability. © 2017 FEA.

The purpose of this paper is to further delve into such studies by investigating which commonly measurable structural production factors (horizontal, vertical and lateral diversification; operating area; number of associates; and time in operation) have greater impacts on the financial performance of such cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve such a goal, a survey was conducted with a sampling pool divided by size (annual net revenues of US$ 50 million or higher), and the questionnaire was employed as a method of data collection. The sample was concentrated in the southern, south-eastern and mid-western regions of Brazil; classified by size; and deemed adequate after several adequacy tests. Findings: The results were analysed using Spearmans correlation, which showed that there were no significant correlations between the structural production factors considered in this study and the economic-financial performance of agricultural cooperatives, which leads to questions about the effectiveness of employing diversification strategies with a conjoint approach. Nonetheless, it was possible to identify several relationships not mentioned in the original hypotheses that might be addressed further in future studies. Research limitations/implications: The data obtained should be interpreted with caution because heteroscedasticity was detected. Although the cause could not be clearly identified, the presence of heteroscedasticity could mean that smaller and similar cooperatives present similar variation in their diversification and production base strategies. Originality/value: This work sought to generate knowledge regarding operations management, which was achieved by demonstrating that production diversification in a dynamic and relevant economic sector, that is, agricultural cooperatives, is limited in terms of financial return when performed in an isolated mode. Hence, cooperatives production managers should take into account the totality of structural production factors during their planning activities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,,Co-operative society micro-saving bank; Economic growth; Innovative small business model; Poverty alleviation; Socio-economic development

Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world with low GDP/capita and minimum purchasing power. Almost a third of the total population (165 million) of the country lives below the national poverty line ($2/day). Growth & development of sustainable level of small businesses, which create employments for low & semi-skilled workers, mainly self-employments, are considered one of the most effective ways to lift the nation out of the vicious cycle of poverty, are target & attention of the country. To pave the way for MFIs since 1970s, especially during the new wave of microcredit in the 1990s, has come to be seen as an important development policy and a poverty alleviation tool in Bangladesh. The aim of the paper is to analyse existence MFIs and its microcredit policies and propose effective microcredit policies for growth & development of small businesses and socio-economic development. The researcher undergoes a field survey using a semi-structured questionnaires and a scheduled face-to-face interview in Bangladesh.

To facilitate the success of an area-wide management approach, social factors need to be understood and addressed. This study qualitatively analyses social, psychological and institutional barriers and facilitators for the widespread adoption of area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly, and attitudes towards the use of sterile insect technology. Interviews were conducted (N = 35) with fruit growers, industry representatives, agronomists, government representatives and community leaders from across the dominant horticultural regions of southeastern Australia. Transcripts were analysed and compared based on thematic organisations. Growers and stakeholders expressed high acceptance for area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly and the use of sterile insect technology. However, participants reported limited knowledge of both area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Factors found to facilitate acceptance were perceptions of increased market access, increased social awareness, operationalising community champions and value chain actors, as well as dissemination of credible scientific evidence. Trust in those individuals advocating area-wide management and sterile insect technology, and interpersonal trust between neighbours, was also seen as an important factor affecting adoption of area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Barriers to acceptance included perceptions of costs and ongoing funding needs, lack of knowledge, apathy towards control of Queensland fruit fly, compatibility of area-wide management and sterile insect technology with current practices and a lack of social cooperation amongst growers. The data show a need to increase growers awareness of costs and benefits associated with Queensland fruit fly control and an understanding of the direct and indirect consequences of their own on-farm behaviours with respect to control. This study is the first to use a psychological lens to explore and distil grower and stakeholder attitudes towards a cooperative management approach for a pest of national significance. Results provide insight into beliefs that guide underlying biosecurity decision-making and can help improve uptake of other area-wide control techniques. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s12197-016-9376-4,Agency theory; Corporate governance; Credit unions; Excess shares; Uninsured deposits

Such incentives derived from marketing cooperatives include indirect benefits such as reduction in transaction costs arising from participation in imperfect factor and product markets. However, whether marketing through cooperatives also creates direct economic benefits as additional incentives by securing competitive producer prices is not empirically established in the relevant development literature to augment related policy debates and to rationalize investments on such institutions. Using a farm economic model on producer price data taken from Ethiopian smallholders who produce sesame as a traditional cash crop, this paper empirically tested the power and influence of the cooperative institution on the level of producer prices received by farmers. The results show the instrumental role of marketing cooperatives in terms of securing competitive producer prices to farmers. The evidence provides empirical support to justify the desirability of revitalizing institutional marketing schemes as appropriate mechanisms to improve the economic incentives of smallholders for better market participation and commercialization towards poverty reduction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1080/00856401.2017.1342183,Central India; CSA; Marketing and supply chains; Organic food; Producer co-operatives; SAPCO; Small farmers; Traditional knowledge

The key engine for this marketing experiment is the Sahaja Aharam Producer Company Limited (SAPCO), a producer organisation. SAPCO has tried to create new supply chains that guarantee that the produce it sells complies with the quality standards needed to certify the foods as organic. SAPCO is an initiative of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) which has taken up the bulk of the financial and administrative burden of managing the company. The revival of traditional knowledge for organic farming and the marketing of organic produce has invariably required the intervention of external agents such as CSA. In the final section, we assess the achievements of SAPCO from the viewpoint of the small farmers who belong to the producer co-operatives that make up SAPCOs membership.

The small size of Israel has allowed young families to inhabit the countryside while working in nearby cities. Such rural urbanization has not happened in Israels periphery, such as the Eshkol region (western Negev), where bad public transportation makes it harder to commute to Beer Sheva or Tel Aviv.

The findings provide a decision base for policy-makers to improve the technology base and to ease the reliance on technology imports. The countrys agricultural producers have been struggling with the introduction of new technologies, and customers are showing conservative demand patterns. Previous research showed that technology transfer into Russian agricultural enterprises suffers from a low knowledge level especially in receiving organizations.

We interviewed administrators at twenty Costa Rican coffee cooperatives about management practices related to voluntary certification. Voluntary certifications are popular among coffee cooperatives. Access to certified markets is facilitated by state support of the cooperative sector, regulation of the coffee sector and well-enforced environmental and social laws. However, there are no significant or consistent financial incentives for farmers to pursue certification. Multiple certifications may lower auditing and implementation costs, but cooperatives rarely receive the full premium for multiply-certified coffee. Low market demand for certified coffee, weak price incentives and high auditing and management costs encourage cooperatives to certify only a portion of their members. This strategy rewards compliant farmers rather than inducing widespread change to farming practices among the entire membership. Though financial incentives are weak, certifications offer non-financial benefits to both farmers and cooperatives, including better management and more resilient cooperatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.09.014,Advisory services; Cooperatives; Family agriculture; Group processes; Rural development; Rural extension
,beyond the market? new agrarianism and cooperative farmland access in north america,Wittman H.; Dennis J.; Pritchard H.,Journal of Rural Studies,7430167,53,,303-316,2017,Elsevier Ltd,,"Working with farmers' groups, associations and cooperatives constitutes a fundamental element of extension work with family farmers. Despite the fact that extension practitioners face many problems in this area of their work, there is currently a lack of academic literature that systematically addresses the topic and offers concrete guidelines for practice. Thus, this paper will aim to clarify the benefits of farmers' groups, associations and networks within the context of family farming, systematise problems faced by rural extensionists when working with farmers' groups and associations, provide conceptual tools for understanding group and associative processes, and construct a set of guidelines and recommendations for facing said problems. In order to achieve these aims, the authors conducted an extensive literature review and drew upon their personal experience on the topic. Results suggest that some of the benefits of associative work are: better access to inputs, produce and credit markets, the facilitation of learning processes, the empowerment of family farmers as social actors, and a reduction of rural extension costs. Additionally, with respects to the problems faced by extensionists, the following can be highlighted: individualist attitudes and conflicts between farmers, scarce participation and commitment, problems with leaderships and with organisations' administrative management, and the lack of extensionists' training to address these processes, among others. With regards to the factors that increase trust and cooperation are: interpersonal communication and mutual knowledge, sharing problems, values and objectives, and the existence of shared rules for the functioning of the group that include sanctions for transgressors. In this context, the extensionists' role will be that of facilitating processes of construction of group relationships, creating rules for the groups' functioning and developing the group's capacities for self-management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.03.007,Agrarian reform; Community farms; Food sovereignty; Land access; Land cooperative; Land tenure

In response to challenges faced by new entrants to agriculture in accessing farmland oriented towards localized and alternative food systems, advocates for farmland protection and cooperative land access point to the potential for community-based land reform to support sustainable land use while promoting social and political equity  areas where they argue an economic system based on individual ownership of farmland has failed. Based on the principles of new agrarianism, community-based farmland access initiatives are experimenting with new forms and practices of cooperative and shared land tenure, as an alternative to a state-led model of redistributive land reform based on individual property rights. We analyze here the results of a participatory research project conducted with a cooperative and community-based land trust and land access program in British Columbia, Canada. We assess the efficacy of the community farms program as a potential mechanism to spark a new phase of agrarian transition that can reverse farmland consolidation and support socially and ecologically embedded land relations, as a structural context for food sovereignty in North America. Specifically, we argue that the community foodlands trust movement can be viewed an insurgent  but fundamentally constrained  people's enclosure within a corporate land regime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,Cooperative; Credit; Economic development; Financial system

Nevertheless, it has been argued that supervision is mainly associated with broad monitoring duties, including advice and guidance, whereas audit is usually limited to a financial and legal control of the enterprise. The aforementioned institutions have not been adequately prescribed by law and effectively applied in practice, in order to address the cooperatives needs and protect the members, the minoritys and the public interest. The recent legal reforms, since the outbreak of the crisis, brought to the fore the topic of cooperative supervision and audit. Thus, a question is posed of whether they have been a positive step forward. The present article, therefore, aiming to analyze relevant past and recent laws, concluded that despite minor innovations the shortcoming of the above institutions are yet to be resolved. Thus, a politically independent supervisory authority, a cooperative-oriented audit examining the cooperatives impact to its members, the environment and the local community, as well as the formation of a scientific committee to monitor the cooperative laws implementation are suggested as necessary changes for the improvement of the existing regime. © 2018, European Business Law Review.

Rice cultivation is associated with emissions of potent GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide. Thai rice has been massively exported worldwide however the markets are becoming more competitive than ever since the green market has been hugely promoted. In order to maintain the same level or enhance of competitiveness, Thai rice needs to be considered for environmentally conscious products to meet the international environmental standards. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of rice production in order to identify the major emission sources and possible reduction strategies. In this research, the rice variety considered is Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105) cultivated by organic practices. The data sources were Don-Chiang Organic Agricultural Cooperative (DCOAC), Mae-teang district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand and the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) of Thailand with onsite records and interviews of farmers in 2013. The GHG emissions were calculated from cradle-to-farm by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and the 2006 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The functional unit is defined as 1 kg of paddy rice at farm gate. Results showed that the total GHG emissions of organic rice production were 0.58 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice. The major source of GHG emission was from the field emissions accounting for 0.48 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice, about 83% of total, followed by land preparation, harvesting and other stages (planting, cultivation and transport of raw materials) were 9, 5 and 3% of total, respectively. The comparative results clearly showed that the GHG emissions of organic paddy rice were considerably lower than conventional rice production due to the advantages of using organic fertilisers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,Developing country; Economic; Education; Information communication technology; Livelihoods; Rural farmers

This field trial was carried out between June and September 2017 on 40 farms randomly selected from members of the Naari Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society in Naari sub-location of Meru County, Kenya. An abridged dairy management handbook, developed by Farmers Helping Farmers and the University of Prince Edward Island, was translated into the local dialect, and disseminated as short message text. After pre-intervention knowledge and attitudes assessments on dairy management, farms were randomly allocated into intervention and comparison groups. Using an online short message service interface (because the study population all had cell phones but only 1.7% had smart phones), short messages on management practices were sent daily, for 3 months, to the phones owned by the farmers in the intervention group. Post-intervention assessment of dairy management knowledge and attitudes related to the messages was done 3 weeks post-intervention. Within and between group comparisons and net changes were determined using t-tests, Chi-squared tests where applicable. There were no significant demographic or knowledge differences between the two groups pre-intervention. Compared to pre-intervention, trained farmers in the intervention group were significantly more informed on: mastitis prevention, disease (calf diarrhea) prevention, stall management, the role of a balanced nutritious diet on immunity and the resolution of some health conditions post-intervention. Translation of message content to the local language and using easily understandable terminology were reported to be helpful for better understanding and motivation of farmers to implement recommendations.

This performance analysis was performed using the indicators proposed by the CAMEL model, then the data envelopment analysis (DEA). It can be seen that there is a positive relationship between the use of variables in the model and the measurement of financial performance of credit unions. Moreover, according to the results, it can be observed that Uniprime Northern Paraná Sicoob Cocred and Sicredi North RS/SC were cooperatives that stood out as efficient. © 2017 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Contaduría y Administración",,10.25081/jpc.2018.v46.i3.2078,Cashewnut; Direct marketing; Marketing efficiency; Meghalaya; Value chain

It was observed that increase in farm size is accompanied by higher productivity and remunerative price fetched by large farmers as compared to other categories of cashew growers. The net price received by the farmers was the highest when they sold their produce directly to consumers. The highest benefit cost ratio was achieved by the large farms because of judicious expenditure in cashew production and obtaining a sizeable amount of returns. In the West Garo Hills, cashew value chain needs application of modern technology and proper management practices for better production and marketing. The study highlight that the prospect of cashew value chain in Meghalaya is bright as the trend of other traditional crop production in the potential areas is quite encouraging for the organic cashew farming. There is enough scope for enhancing organic produce of cashew. Direct marketing of cashew produce always fetch good price for the producer but it is not possible for all categories of farmers. Therefore, formation of cooperative societies of cashew growers is suggested for marketing of various inputs as well as outputs of cashew produce. © Indian Society for Plantation Crops.

,a double-exponential jump model and its application to risk measure in wheat spot market,Huang X.,Economics Bulletin,15452921,37,2,1298-1309,2017,Economics Bulletin,,"The centre-periphery relation is a dual model (Nemes Nagy, 1998), several meanings of which can be defined, like locational, development or social dualism. This paper is meant to analyse one example of the manifestation of development - in other words: economic - dualism: this is the spatial realisation of access or exclusion that can be experienced in case of credit institute activities. An important starting point for the issue is the business philosophy and operational distinction of Hungarian actors in the credit institute market (a segment of the representatives of global commercial banks and locally embedded savings cooperatives), and the analysis of the geographical range of their activities (Kovács, 2014a; 2017), and also the survey of their relationship to developed centre regions and lagging peripheral areas.

While the marketplace is dominated by large corporations such as General Mills and Kraft Heinz, there exist few farmer cooperatives with well-known brands, which may imply its long-term viability is jeopardized. Therefore, this study analyzes trademark data of U.S. farmer cooperatives to better determine (i) which types of farmer cooperatives brand and (ii) how much farmer cooperatives brand relative to firms. Per the first negative binomial model, trademark ownership intensity is relatively high for marketing cooperatives in dairy, fruits and vegetables, nuts, and several other raw commodities. However, the second model indicates farmer cooperatives own 1086% fewer trademarks as compared to firms in the same sectors. U.S. farmer cooperatives thus have relatively weak brand equity. To spur future competitiveness by means of branding, farmer cooperatives may improve product quality, adapt ownership structure characteristics to facilitate member investment in long-term growth opportunities, use strategic arrangements to assign control of non-member business to decision specialists, form common agencies with other farmer cooperatives, or use family-based or origin-based connotations to raise consumer willingness-to-pay. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.7819/rbgn.v0i0.2617,Credit unions; Earnings management; Income smoothing; Panel data; UNICRED

Design/methodology/approach  The method adopted was the Classic Linear Regression Model with Panel Data, estimated by Feasible Generalized Least Squares for fixed effects and corrections for heteroscedasticity. The sample was made up of 113 credit unions affiliated to UNICRED systems, over the 2001-2011 period, and data was made available by Central Bank of Brazil. Findings  The analysis, carried out through non-discretionary results on credit operations in order to explain the changes in net expenses of provision on credit operations, indicated there was smoothing of results. Thus, we can infer that the credit unions affiliated to UNICRED make use of earnings management in the income smoothing modality. Originality/value  This study contributes to the issue of Accounting Results Management, and corroborates that there are indications that, in the occurrence of higher non-discretionary results, credit unions tend to maximize provisions. Similarly, in the occurrence of lower non-discretionary results, they tend to minimize provisions, making evident the search for smaller variability in results, thus signaling mitigation of risks. © FECAP.",,10.1590/1234-56781806-94790560106,Agribusiness cooperative; Competitiveness; Economic and financial analysis

In this paper, we analyse the CSR activities of the regional co-operatives of the leading Finnish retailer S Group based on annual board reporting. In light of our findings, we argue that no consistently high level of CSR can be identified across the S Group and all its regional co-operatives. Therefore, we do not deem it feasible to conclude that consumer co-operatives are inherently socially responsible organizations merely due to their organization form. Instead, it seems that the fact that the members are in charge in a consumer co-operative and elect a board to oversee it serves to keep the responsibility in the hands of local residents, but at the same time, it also requires a genuine interest towards governance of the co-operative as well as CSR issues. In the absence of either, the level of responsibility is likely to depend on the interest management and board members show in these issues. The paper concludes with practical implications for the S Group and consumer co-operatives in general as well future avenues for research on CSR and consumer co-operatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1007/s10333-017-0601-3,Artificial neural network; Discriminant analysis; Double cropping; Logistic regression

Eleven factors (age, education, occupation, family size, type of farm ownership, distance to the agricultural service center, attending agricultural extension courses, use of financial resources and bank loans, number of domestic animals, area under cultivation, and social participation) were examined. An additional objective was to compare the ability of the three models in predicting the adoption of double cropping. ANNs showed an overall predictive power of 89.8%. LDA showed an overall predictive power of 83.2%, with seven of the eleven independent variables being effective on the adoption of double cropping. LGR indicated an overall predictive power of 87.6%, with eight of the eleven independent variables being effective on the adoption of double-rice cropping. ANNs showed higher power than LGR and LDA in predicting the adoption of double cropping. Based on all three methods used for analysis, the most important independent variables were social participation and area under cultivation (positive factors) as well as distance to the agricultural service center and family members (negative factors). Establishment of cooperatives or other kinds of farmers associations to foster social participation could motivate adoption of double cropping, particularly among small-scale farmers. To increase agricultural services, more local centers should be created in rural areas. The government should promote double cropping through effective incentives and technology transfer to small-scale farmers. © 2017, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan KK.",,10.18543//baidc-53-2018pp139-155,Cooperative society; Destination; Economic Solidarity; Surplus

This is the issue to be discussed in this paper. The conventional understanding is that large-scale production is about land concentration and scale management through agricultural businesses, family farms, or agricultural cooperatives. In our view, given the unfavorable Chinese land/people ratio, any attempt to eliminate household-based, small-scale farming is bound to fail. This study suggests that a paradigm shift is needed from Scale Management to Scale Service. Todays agricultural production is no longer a Pole-like Straight Way model. Different stages and processes of production have their own unique characteristics and functions. With the advancement of agricultural technology and the marketization of production factors, agricultural service has needed to catch up in scale. However, this development does not have to be based on land concentration and the elimination of household farming. On the contrary, it can be done through local social networks. Local social networks can significantly reduce the organizational costs of large-scale services without changing the current household-based small farming community structure. This will bring about a new system of Agricultural Business Management that can both improve production efficiency and protect small farmers livelihoods. Such a model is a combination of tradition and market. It should play an important role in the rural reconstruction and urbanization of central and western China. © The Author(s) 2017.",,10.1177/194277861701000303,agriculture; Cuba; Denmark; Rochdale; socialism

As socialist theory requires movement away from state-centered and toward mixed economies, I examine Danish and Cuban cooperative agricultural movements, evaluating them with respect to the Rochdale Principles of cooperative production, to identify appropriate economic production forms for democratic, participatory socialism within the context of globalization. This study argues first that, to maximize efficiency, cooperative production processes must remain entirely in the hands of cooperative federations. Second, a culture of economic democracy is reinforced by the democratic principles of cooperative work. Third, an income tax would function as a more appropriate way for the Cuban state to obtain a share of returns from agricultural cooperatives than the current production quota system, to avoid disrupting cooperative incentive structures. Fourth, cooperatives can perform well in any industry, at all levels of technological development, and should be considered a dominant model for socialism. Finally, although the Rochdale Principles are based on economic and social justice, these principles and their practical application must be continually refined through further experimentation and research. © 2017 Institute for Human Geography.",,10.14707/ajbr.180047,Cooperative; Loyalty; Members participation; Satisfaction; Value co-creation

Further research on increasing the survival rate of cultivated mountain ginseng (CMG) until harvesting and preventing damage by wild animals is also deemed necessary. More effective use of related municipal budget subsidy needs to be supported selectively to the enterprising farmers who aggressively pursue mountain ginseng cultivation and business management. Opening CMG retail stores to realize sustainable income growth and developing various processed products will increase farm income.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample comprising of 1,272 credit union observations over the period 2008-2013, panel OLS regressions are performed to establish the association between co-operative governance and CSED. A comparison of the pre- and post-regulatory influences on co-operative governance and CSED is also performed. Findings - The findings, which are in support of both legitimacy and institutional theories, depict a positive and significant association between co-operative governance and CSED. The significance of the co-operative governance score improves from the pre-regulation period to the post-regulation period. Other significant variables influencing the volume of CSED by credit unions in Kenya include credit union size and financial performance as measured by the return on assets. Research limitations/implications - The study examines CSED practices in a developing country and in organizations in a single sector. Further, CSED is measured using a self-constructed index with data being obtained from audited annual reports only. Practical implications - The study highlights the need to develop CSED guidelines tailored for credit unions, and a focus on co-operative governance as a way of improving disclosure practices. Originality/value - The study utilizes a sector-specific governance variable and a CSED index to examine the association between the two variables by credit unions in a developing country. The study also attempts to investigate the role of regulation on the association between co-operative governance and the volume of CSED. © Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.05.008,Bioassays; Ecotoxicity; Fatty acids; Herbicide; Metal; Plankton

According to information from agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley (Figueira da Foz, Portugal), Primextra® Gold TZ is the most used herbicide in corn crop fields and one of the 20 best-selling herbicides in Portugal. Copper is mainly used in pesticide formulations. This study aims to determine the ecotoxicological and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) effects of the herbicide Primextra® Gold TZ and the metal copper on marine plankton. The organisms used in this study are three planktonic species: the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, the estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa and nauplii of the marine brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Fatty acids (FAs) are one of the most important molecules transferred across the plant-animal interface in aquatic food webs and can be used as good indicators of stress. The conducted lab incubations show that T. weissflogii is the most sensitive species to the herbicide followed by A. tonsa (EC50 = 0.0078 mg/L and EC50 = 0.925 mg/L, respectively), whereas the copepod was the most sensitive species to the metal followed by T. weissflogii (EC50 = 0.234 mg/L and EC50 = 0.383 mg/L, respectively). A. franciscana was the most tolerant organism both to the herbicide and to the metal (EC50 = 20.35 mg/L and EC50 = 18.93 mg/L, respectively). Changes in the FA profiles of primary producer and primary consumers were observed, with the increase of saturated FA and decrease of unsaturated FA contents, especially of highly unsaturated FAs that can be obtained mainly from food and therefore are referred to as 'essential FA'. The study suggests that discharges of Primextra® Gold TZ or other pesticides mainly composed by copper may be a threat to plankton populations causing changes in the FA contents and thus in their nutritive value, with severe repercussions for higher trophic levels and thus the entire food web. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1007/s10997-016-9340-x,Corporate governance; Decision-making process; Institutional logics; Organizational institutionalism; Practice adoption

Thus, the literature on the subject asserts that the first cooperatives originated from the struggle for better living conditions and improvements in their remuneration, seeking to meet the interests of lower-income workers and rural producers. After analyzing the main factors underlying the historical evolution of cooperatives, the article presents the theoretical principles established by the Transaction Costs Theory (TCT) aiming to interpret the process of commercialization of production as carried out by agricultural cooperatives. It is understood that a cooperative consists in a complex of contracts, being an important institution that seeks to save transaction costs by internalizing the marketing of cooperative members. This fact is not much explored in the literature that discusses agribusiness in Brazil. The paper concludes that it is possible to establish a connection between TCT and the nature of agricultural cooperatives since the contracts signed reduce the risks of opportunistic behavior and the uncertainty that producers would face if they resorted to the market to transact their products. © 2016, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

We aimed to analyse whether certified smallholders gain better access to timber markets and better financial incentives. We used three smallholder forest enterprises from Gunungkidul and Kulon Progo districts, Java, Indonesia as case studies of different managerial operations. Two were farmer cooperatives and the other was an external trading company in partnership with village-level farmer groups. Different certification schemes and managerial approaches were analysed whether such factors influenced the ability of smallholders to access certified timber markets and obtain improved offers for their timber. We found that smallholders find it challenging to enter and participate in certified timber markets and to obtain the promised premium prices. The obvious costs of certification and uncertain benefits are major challenges for smallholders. Even when market opportunities are present, certification alone is insufficient to tap into these markets. Certified forest enterprises need dedicated managers with adequate entrepreneurial skills to establish networks and contacts with potential buyers, and to actively seek information on what is specified by certified timber processors. © 2017, Kassel University Press GmbH.

Design/methodology/approach - The study employs choice experiments to estimate trust implicitly as opposed to the common practice of measuring trust explicitly. Several experiments were conducted to assess members' level of trust and commitment to marketing cooperatives in rural Ethiopia. Findings - The results of the study indicate that significant number of farmers do not yet have trust in their organization and fellow members in both absolute and relative terms. The probability of trust increases when members actively participate in cooperative governance, are less diverse, stay longer in the cooperative, and when cooperatives are older. The authors also learnt that both trust and commitment have indeed improved the performance of farmers' market organizations. Trust in cooperative is asymmetrically sensitive to incentives and disincentives. Research limitations/implications - The study implied that research efforts attempting to estimate trust in collective action shall use an implicit measurement and consider the sensitivity of trust to relativeness, incentives and types of transactions. Practical implications - The findings of this study showed that rural organizations that are established with external help, such as agricultural cooperatives in Africa, seem to struggle to earn the trust of their current and potential members. This implies that given the effectiveness and persistence of informal rural organizations emerged through mutual trust, cooperatives must be organized either through informal ways as trust-based organizations or based on cooperative business principles of voluntarism and independence. Originality/value - This paper employs the behaviorally appealing choice experiment approach to capture the different aspects of trust such as relativism, sensitivity of trust to incentive and types of transactions in smallholder producers' organizations. © Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.1080/20780389.2015.1114413,cooperatives; microcredit; microfinance; stakeholder; Togo

More highly educated than men, and gender-wise, women farmers are highly self-reliant; however, their socio-economic strength is not fully capitalized through cooperative endeavors to foster productivity on their farms. This research examines women's cooperatives and the operations of women farmers in two remote rural communities using focus group discussion and targeted on-site investigation approaches. We find that over the years, small farming cooperatives are unsustainable because of their land-tenure problem, and lack of decision-making power at the grassroots level. The research suggests that the potential of women farmers in rural Jamaica has not been well utilized to foster their farming cooperatives. Crucially needed is the promotion of grassroots-based farming groupings to ensure the durability of cooperatives, as well as a multi-sector approach in agriculture, and the intensification of appropriate technological applications in all stages of farming, coupled with micro-food processing. Furthermore, a conducive environment for agricultural production and economic return requires land reform, increasing marketing opportunities, and cooperatives based on the diversification of agricultural and non-agricultural activities. © 2017 Journal of International Women's Studies.",,,
,agricultural economics and the agrarian lobby in hungary under state socialism,Varga Z.,East Central Europe,943037,44,3-Feb,284-308,2017,Brill Academic Publishers,,"This piece presents the life and work of Mayor Ferdinand Duchatsch, doctor of law and politician. As the title of the piece suggests, the author would like to especially emphasise the dual nature of his national allegiance. Even his contemporaries noted that he was Slovenian by origin, but considered himself German, although he would occasionally, especially at prelection rallies, emphasise his Slovenian origin. Ferdinand Duchatsch was born on 1. February 1845 in Maribor to his father Franc Xavier (1788-1870) and his mother Marie, born Kriehuber (1808-1900). Like his father, who became a citizen of Maribor in 1832, Ferdinand Duchatsch studied law. After his father died he took over management of his law firm. The name Duchatsch can be found among bankruptcy managers, jurors and legal advocate in lawsuits and criminal proceedings. Duchatsch's political work began with his election to the Maribor municipal council in 1869, to which he was later repeatedly elected. Unlike his father, who was disinterested in higher politics, Duchatsch managed to succeed in the wider political arena. In 1878 he was elected as a representative in the provincial assembly, two years earlier (1876) he was elected as a representative in the state parliament. In 1880 he left both positions because of, as he put it in the resignation letter, family affairs. Nevertheless, three years later he achieved the high point of his political career - the municipal council managed to get him elected as mayor of Maribor in their third attempt. He was in this position until early 1886, when he was succeeded by Alexander Nagy. The following events, that transpired while he was mayor, should be emphasised: a visit form emperor Franz Joseph I. (July 1983 and September 1885), the unveiling of a monument honouring archduke Johann (July 1883), the unveiling of a monument in honour of admiral Tegetthoff (July 1883, as the emperor was visiting), the completion of the Landwehr barracks, hospital addition, the construction of the Loka street and the connection between Tovarnika and Kopalika street, the regulation of a ditch in Grako suburbs, the regulation of Kopalika, i?ka and Ribika streets, the connection between Schmiderjeva and Verbanska street, the ratification of a plan for the cities expansion, the restoration of the cathedral, the excavation of canals in ?RNA and Brvarska streets, the purchase of two waggons and devices for pneumatic emptying of sewage tanks, the construction of the City savings bank and a girls school (both were opened in May 1886), the construction of a footbridge for connecting the Koroko suburb and the right bank of the Drava river (opened in May 1886) etc. In the time Duchatsch was mayor there were allegations made by the opposition about the in-transparent and poorly thought out budgets of the city municipality, these large debts, the choice of construction contractors and other city work past any kind of public applications, hidden financing of the newspaper Marburger Zeitung by the municipality and the influence on its editorial policy. The main objections coming from the Slovenian and catholic side was the favouring of Germans and intolerance to the Roman catholic church. Apart from political activity Duchatsch was also active in many societies and associations: Theatre and casino society, German education society, Society for the support of poor pupils, Choir society, Men's coir society, Volunteer firefighting society, Wine trader's association of Styria, Veteran society, AustroHungarian civil servant's society, Styrian horse breeder's society, Exercise society, Philharmonic society, Slovenska matica etc. He was also a member of city and district school councils, railway committee in the state parliament, auditor in Ekskompt bank, supervisor of the Fruit farmers' cooperative etc. In his private life he occupied himself with viticulture (he was one of the wine exhibitors at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873), singing (baritone), he was a popular speaker and lyric. About his appearance we only learn from the newspapers that he had a squint in one eye and a large belly.

The most important reform was the abolition of the system of compulsory delivery. This article aims to outline how the political change affected agrarian economics and also highlights the significant role played by some scholars, with their latent presence and their policy suggestions, which the Kádár Government had the courage to support in November 1956. With the emergence of the so-called Agrarian Lobby, of the intertwining networks of politicians, administrators, and scientists of the agrarian sector, the personal and intellectual preconditions had already been in place before 1956. Institutionalization, however, could only come about after the partial rehabilitation of market economy. The post-1956 political leadership could only meet the challenge of re-defining the relationship of the state and the agricultural cooperatives with the contribution of professionals. At the same time, the shape and nature of Kádár era agrarian economic research were also affected by the alliance between the practitioners of the field and the emerging network of agro-politicians and administrators, the Agrarian Lobby. Two key figures, Ferenc Erdei and Lajos Fehér, shared the responsibility for the better performance of agriculture.

The main problems of functioning production systems are monopolization of grain production in the spring-sown field; concentration of bigger volume of production of livestock production in the farms of the population, small-scale unorganized production; seasonality of work; violation of the principle of a permanency of fixing of manpower to technical means and objects of production; ignoring of rational, specialized forms of job management; insufficient employment of a rural population in social production. All of these found reflections in performance indicators of the functioning of production systems are consequences of lack of evidence-based approach to the process of forming of their efficiency. It is proved that rural consumer cooperative has a number of advantages before other forms of conducting agricultural production. Results of economic-mathematical modeling to determine its fundamental role is increase in efficiency of functioning of production systems. © International Economic Society.",,,Agricultural cooperatives; Cooperatives; Strategy

For the analysis we used a sample of 58 cooperatives that have prominent representation in the state of Paraná agribusiness, Brazil. For the evaluation of financial performance were used for calculation of outcome indicators gross margin, operating margin and net margin. The results show that when only analyzed the financial performance, the non-industrialized cooperative obtains a result of the business end better than the industrial cooperatives.

Originality/value: In recent years, the microfinance community has witnessed unwanted consequences of microcredit misuse. We present an original approach about the way credit unions may achieve their target in a responsible way, offering appropriate products, services and training to the entire community involved. Design/methodology/approach: Through secondary data and interviews with decision makers and credit union members, we studied the case of Cresol Baser, a large credit union in Brazil. We analyzed data based on inductive theorizing. First and second-order themes were identified, resulting in a procedural model, representing relationships between responsible microfinance factors. Findings: The three main dimensions in the model of inclusive microfinance - conditions, proximity, and access - were integrated in order to promote a dynamic that respects the assumption of a responsible financial inclusion with regards to design, offer and access of products and services related to microfinance. © 2017 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

The study analyses the views of 106 preparers of SACCO disclosures. Principal Component-Factor analyses and ordinary least squares regression approaches are utilized to establish significant disclosure items and drivers. The findings show that SACCO disclosures are mainly addressed to members and the regulator. SACCOs provide disclosures to comply with regulations as well as build their image. The results reveal that disclosures by SACCOs in Kenya mainly center on mandatory financial aspects, which is followed by voluntary disclosure on strategic aspects, social aspects, governance aspects and environmental conservation in that order. The findings show that disclosures by SACCOs in Kenya are positively influenced by governance. According to the findings, the influence of the disclosure guidelines issued by the professional accounting body in Kenya and financial performance on disclosure seem to be weak.Other significant drivers of disclosure by SACCOs include resources (assets) and licensing.The findings are useful to policy makers in designing anoptimal disclosure policy for SACCOs in a developing country context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1057/jdg.2015.13,Credit Cooperative Banks; non-profit firms; Social Report; stakeholder management; voluntary disclosure

They are habitually seen as institutions which show a clear orientation toward ethics because their main objective is to provide direct benefits to internal and external stakeholders. To this aim, through an empirical investigation of their Websites, we analyze the propensity of these banks to provide Social Reports. Within the stakeholder management theory, the attention to mission, the number of stakeholders identified, the prospects of social reporting and their structure, and other aspects, are analyzed. Although many researches show that banking systems with a high number of cooperative banks can handle future potential periods of financial stress more efficiently, on the empirical side, the survey highlights that these banks are not ready yet to address the growing audience of potential customers who seem to be more interested in the respect of ethical and social conditions. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",,,Agricultural cooperatives; Organizational structure; Sheep breeding; Sheep meat

To achieve the proposed aim, an exploratory qualitative study of the four cooperatives operating in the sheep meat production chain in the State of Paraná in the year 2016 was done. Managers of these cooperatives and production chain experts were interviewed. For the analysis of results, cooperatives were classified into two groups: those which engage in various agro-industrial activities, and those which work exclusively in the sheep industry. The results obtained showed that there is not a single sheep production technological standard in the State of Paraná, and that cooperatives already worked in other agribusiness segments, the sheep industry being an additional activity in the portfolio of these companies, which seem to achieve better results by including this activity, involving higher expectations of expansion and seeking strategies to overcome major challenges, especially those related to animal slaughter and meat/meat by-product processing. © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

The impact of vertical coordination mechanisms in local food supply chains in developing countries remains underexplored. This paper analyzes the impact of participation of honey producers in the Northern highlands of Tigray, Ethiopia in contracts and marketing cooperatives on their performance and wellbeing. The paper finds positive production and economic gains honey producers obtain from contract engagement. Honey producers under the contract scheme produce more white honey fulfilling the demand of processors, buyers and consumers. Contracting results in higher production due to the better access it causes to technology and skill transfers. Moreover, better conditions contracts offer motivates honey producers to produce more and supply larger to the market. © 2016, Alemu et al.",,,Ecological aspects; Economic; Farm sustainability; Framework for assessment; Governance; Social

Second, evolution of the concept and the major approaches for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises is discussed. More adequate definition of the farming enterprises sustainability is suggested as ability of a particular form to maintain its governance, economic, social and ecological functions in a long term. Finally, a specific for the conditions of Bulgarian agriculture framework for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises is proposed.

Whether driven by a quest for a more efficient organizational structure or by wealth expropriation incentives, different methods of demutualization have different implications for wealth allocation among current members and transfers of wealth to outsiders. While credit union sectors internationally have, to date, experienced few demutualizations, there are increasing incentives for such organizational change. Three alternative demutualization strategies (share issue to members plus an external capital raising, liquidation and cash distribution to members (a quasi-demutualization), and merger with a listed company) recently used by Australian credit unions are analysed to highlight wealth implications, survival risks for the mutual form and potential problems arising in the demutualization process. © 2016 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC",,10.1111/apce.12135,bank; common bond; cooperative; G21; incentives; membership; ownership; P13; social enterprise

Our empirical work analyzes panel data from 20012009 for Finnish cooperative banks and compares two empirical concepts of the membership ratio. We find evidence that monetary incentives are important reasons to join, but also the size of the community from which members are recruited plays a role. Over time, monetary incentives have increased and this may have contributed to faster growth in membership in cooperatives based in larger municipalities after these changes.

When invasions impact commodity markets and control decisions are made by many producers, a spatial externality arises due to market-level impacts and delaying the invasion on neighboring parcels. We illustrate how the intrinsic spread rate and the spatial configuration of producers interact to determine the public benefits of private control decisions and the ultimate outcome of species invasions on private property. To coordinate responses to invasions at the market level, a corrective mechanism is suggested in which invaded producers are compensated by all other producers for control actions that alleviate impacts to other producers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,,Collective action; Cooperatives; Free-rider problem; Horizon problem; Returns to size

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between growth and efficiency of SACCOS using economies of scale concept. Then we address the role of management of the capital structure and allocation of resources in the expansion of SACCOS. The study used financial statement data from 60 SACCOS in Tanzania for the period of 2004-2011. The findings supports that most of SACCOS are small and cost inefficient because the industry is young, but, the efficiency increases as SACCOS expand. Second the allocation of resources in liquid, financial and non-financial investment leads to no expansion in SACCOS. Thus, the growth of SACCOS via increasing loan to members, members' savings, shares, and institutional capital should be encouraged as it increases the efficiency of SACCOS. Also, SACCOS should minimize the allocation of assets in other investments which are different from credit to members. © 2016 CIRIEC.",,10.1007/s11842-016-9323-4,Economic reform; Financial access; Forest management; Livelihood; Poverty alleviation

However, it is still difficult for households to receive these loans using forests as collateral. The strong demand for loans from the Rural Credit Cooperative cannot be met. This paper attempts to understand microloan access behavior using 241 respondents in three typical Chinese counties. It argues that the loan is determined by both the demand from the household as well as the supply from banks. Logistic regression models are used to investigate what might affect accessibility to households microloans. Household characteristics like age, education, income, forest characteristics as well as the regional variation of loans are used as explanatory variables. Age, education and income as well as the perception of the bank services are found statistically significant. Other findings include that only half of the respondents who received loans supposed for forest management but use for other purposes. Most importantly, it is found that joint-loan arrangement is more suitable for small-scale households and direct-loan and guaranteed-loans are better match larger property size. A simplified loan-process and discount points would lower transaction costs and improve rural households accessibility to microloan using of forest property collateral. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.",,,Consumer behaviour; Insurance; Non-Muslim consumers; Tak?ful

However, tak?ful does not comprise a significant share of the global insurance market, which is dominated by stock-based, mutual and cooperative organisations. Despite literature advocating its appeal to non-Muslim consumers, there is a gap in research exploring consumer behaviour in this demographic group. This qualitative phenomenological study utilises the theory of planned behaviour as a framework to explore the beliefs and attitudes towards tak?ful among non-Muslim consumers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to identify potential salient mutual-cooperative and religious attributes. The data demonstrate that non-Muslim consumers are unfamiliar with tak?ful products and this knowledge deficiency generates attitudes that negatively influence decision making; however, the provision of product information reveals that faith-based attributes create beliefs that may be salient to attitude formation and influence decision making when applied to the theory of planned behaviour. This study is important for tak?ful researchers in advancing the discussion on non-Muslim consumer behaviour, and for tak?ful operators in understanding non-Muslim behavioural influences as part of a strategic expansion of that demographic. The results suggest further research is required to identify tak?fuls salient attributes and their influence in the decision-making process for non-Muslims. In addition it asks what marketing and promotional strategies should be employed to improve awareness and understanding of tak?ful among non-Muslims. © 2016, International Shariah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

Individual financial statements of assessed agricultural companies are considered to be the relevant source of information. Agricultural companies are represented by commercial companies and agricultural cooperatives. Profit or loss after income tax presents the final complex effect of economic company's performance. The existence and development of companies is conditioned by assets which amount and structure depend on focus and the range of subject activity but as well as on specific factors set by the production process in the agricultural primary production. The increase in liabilities is notable by the influence of unsufficient amount of own company funding sources, mainly the increase in trade payables. The continuance of company reproduction process is secured by a bank loan drawdown. The income situation of companies of agricultural primary production is favourably influenced by the subsidies of non-investment character. During the observed period of years 2004 - 2014 the examined variables were assessed by means of statistical methods. The obtained results of rate determination of statistical correlation between selected variables by means of classical canonical analysis and non-parametric correlation analysis secured that in the assessed group of companies all analysed variables influenced statistically significantly profit or loss after income tax, mainly the total value of assets and non-investment subsidies, except for years 2010, 2012 a 2013, when the statistically insignificant correlations was determined between profit or loss and especially short-term trade payables and current bank loans. As regards the existence point of view it is recommended to companies to maintain the optimal assets and capital structure as well as the achievement of suitable profitability of company's activity.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten committees of management members, ten professional managers and seven co-operative consultants. The study reveals a lack of application of both incentive and monitoring schemes in these entities. An over-emphasis on cost effectiveness is resulting not only in the current little application of such schemes, but also in obstacles towards the application of new ones in the future. Furthermore, any application of monitoring schemes in particular is perceived as having negative implications on the level of trust between the monitor and the monitored. Additionally, few incentives are being applied to promote co-operative principles despite the declared management willingness to do so. The study points out that a number of lacunas need to be overcome for the realization of both types of schemes. Co-operative managers need to become more aware of the objectives of their co-operative and also more determined towards promoting the co-operative principles. The paper also concludes that no trust implications need to arise in the implementation of any type of scheme as long these are well designed, explained and implemented.

Production and management of pigs was affected by lack of organizational strategies to achieve economies of scale at farm level, poor access to market information, limited use of fair and meaningful quality standards, feed shortages during the dry season, disease risks such as African swine fever, and limited access to extension services, agricultural insurance, credit and other financial services. We found that the profit per pig was UShs.17495. Experience in years, amount of land area under piggery use, number of workers, number of pigs sold, making and use of budgets, record keeping and availability of extension services were found to have a significant relationship at 5% with the profit made from piggery business. The piggery business can be made more profitable by establishing farmer groups through which they can save some money and build capital for further investment in their farms. Cooperatives from where farmers can borrow money to support their farming activities should also be introduced. Farmers should be provided with proper extension services, genetically better and more disease resistant pig breeds. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV.

The study incorporated 151 farm households in Gozamin District, East Gojjam, in Ethiopia. A survey questionnaire was used to gather data. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used as methods of data analysis. The result indicated that livelihood diversification, measured by the inverse HerfindahlHirschman diversity index, has a positive and significant effect on sustainable land management activities. Besides, farm households who participated in agricultural extension packages and those engaged in farm cooperatives and in non-farm wage employment activities joined significantly more in sustainable rural land management practices. The integrated rural livelihood and sustainable land management strategy that can help jointly maximise the farm household livelihood and the land management practices is required.

Findings indicate that for both cooperatives, innovation was predominantly spread through formal vertical linkages (i.e. between hierarchal representatives), but was significantly controlled by key actors in leadership positions, resulting in large disparities in the innovation potential of different cooperative members.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a model used to assess patron benefits from a cooperative that is financed by a combination of allocated equity acquired from noncash patronage refunds and unallocated equity acquired from retained earnings. The level of patron benefits is represented by the present value of the after-tax cash flow patrons receive from the cooperative, and the model is used to determine the combination of noncash patronage refunds and retained earnings that provides the greatest present value given the levels of those parameters that affect capitalization of the cooperative and the distribution of cash benefits to patrons. Findings: The analysis demonstrates that only pure plans, i.e., plans based entirely on retained patronage refunds or entirely on retained earnings, will be associated with the greatest present value for any particular set of parameter values. Cooperatives that are characterized by low marginal tax rates and growth rates and whose patrons are characterized by high marginal tax rates and discount rates are those most likely to benefit from equity capitalization programs based on retained earnings. Research limitations/implications: The model is based on the assumption of constant parameter values and does not account for the existence of nonpatronage income. Practical implications: A useful extension of this work would be the development of a decision aid capable of generating basic operating statement and balance sheet data and enabling cooperative decision makers to conduct experiments concerning alternative financing strategies based on retained earnings. Originality/value: The analysis contained in this paper is based on an explicit model and extends across a broad range of values for various parameters that affect the level, timing, and present value of cash distributions from cooperatives. Because the cash flow received by patrons is determined after the cooperatives planned equity growth is met, cash flow comparisons are equivalent with respect to the capital provided the cooperative. In addition, the revolving period is endogenously determined. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.5398/medpet.2017.40.3.210,Cooperative; Dairy farmer; Milk quality; Milk value chain; Value chain governance

Combining a qualitative analysis of structure and decision-making, a financial assessment and the application of a multi-criteria approach (PROMETHEE II), the overall results are in line with expectations (e.g. low levels of member participation, nonprofessional management, low profitability ratios, low leverage and an ability to fulfil financial commitments), except for the relationship between professional management and financial performance.

The trial was conducted for 8 months from April to December 2015. Women farmers stocked six carp species and two small indigenous species (SIS) to ponds. Women farmers were divided into two groups. One group fed their fish with dough of rice bran and mustard oil cake, while the other group installed bamboo substrates in their ponds and fed their fish with half the amount of the feed used by the first group. Women farmers netted and weighed fish monthly to check fish growth and calculate rations. Women farmers were provided with a book to record fish harvested for consumption or sale and fish mortality. Final harvest was done after 8 months of culture. The netted fish were counted, weighed, and returned to the pond as the farmers wanted to keep fish for their biggest festival ""Maghi"" in mid-January. In aggregate, 84 % of farmers consumed fish at home, and 41 % of farmers sold carps. The trial showed that culturing carps with SIS with 50 % feeding amount and with bamboo substrates in ponds resulted in a 22 % higher fish production as compared to the culture of carps with normal feeding. More interestingly, the gross margin of the half-fed periphyton enhanced carp polyculture was almost two times as much as that of the normal fed polyculture system.

A 2 by 2 between-subject design was adopted to generate variation in incentives and prior information about credit risks.

However, providing risk information about the application pool boosted the approval rate and offset the behavioral responses by a roughly same magnitude.

,voluntary certification of agricultural products in competitive markets: the consideration of boundedly rational consumers,Pu X.; Zhang H.,Sustainability (Switzerland),20711050,8,9,-,2016,MDPI,,"Farm subsidies have become increasingly maligned in agricultural policy debates, but the merits of subsidies are a distraction from deeper political, economic, and ecological problems in agriculture. Drawing on a history of the U.S. Farm Bill, this paper argues that a fixation on farm subsidies ignores why they came into being, and more generally glosses over the imperative for modern states to intervene into agricultural economies. Karl Polanyi's 'double movement' framework is used to situate the rise and fall of agricultural supply management within food regime theory. In the second, or surplus food regime, the U.S. government wielded excess commodities as geopolitical toolseven as domestic farm policy labored to contain overproduction, and thus support agrarian viability. In the subsequent corporate food regime, free market agriculture displaces and discredits supply management, even as massive government intervention into how food is grown and sold continues. Making space to remember historical price support programs, to situate their accomplishments and limitations, and to recognize residual supply-management mechanisms (such as farm cooperatives and agricultural marketing orders) is crucial for fostering agricultural viability in the US and beyond. Twentieth century supply management had flaws, but it cannot be wholly omitted. This paper highlights key motivations, elements, and contradictions of these policies and programs to begin the process of considering how supply management principles and strategies could be updated and enhanced for 21st century agriculture. Such a framework would need to pay more attention to diversity within domestic and international agricultures, and be more sensitive to the multi-scalar dimensions of food systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,10.3390/su8090953,Agricultural product market; Bounded rationality; Voluntary certification

This study analyzes how the relative proportion of boundedly rational consumers in the market influences the effectiveness of voluntary certification mechanisms by using a duopoly game model of high- and low-quality firms. The presented results show that a change in the proportion of boundedly rational consumers leads to different certification behaviors and a different market equilibrium. We also find that the existence of boundedly rational consumers is an important factor in the failure of voluntary certification. Indeed, when the relative proportion of such consumers is very high, voluntary certification is ineffective at improving market efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.",,10.1108/BFJ-10-2016-0462,Dairy industry; Milk; Suppliers; Supply chain management; Trust

Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings: The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications: It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications: The research confirms that individual dairy farmers loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value: Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.3362/1755-1986.2016.013,Bank requirements; Financial linkages; Governance; Microfinance/SACCOS

The paper utilizes data collected through in-depth interviews held with both the management of five banks selected primarily because of their active involvement in wholesale lending to SACCOS. In addition 11 SACCOS linked to these five banks were selected in Tanzania and Kenya. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. The findings reveal that measures applied by banks to monitor and control SACCOS-partners include accessing and investing in information on SACCOS-partners and their clients, and requiring both guarantees and forced savings. Compliance with these measures was found to result into two governancerelated reactions: 1) improved compliance with own by-laws, regulations, policies or procedures, and government regulations; and 2) realignment and/or reduced compliance with some of their own by-laws, policies, regulations, and procedures, and thus some of the government regulations, to accommodate bank requirements. © 2016 Practical Action Publishing.",,10.1016/j.tranpol.2016.09.003,Cooperatives; Driver employment; Kenya; Operations management; Paratransit; Service quality

Poor quality of service can be attributed to two features of the paratransit business operating model: driver remuneration on the basis of a daily target system; and cash-based business management in which vehicle depreciation is ignored as an operating expense. In Kenya, the voluntary organisation of fragmented inter-city matatu businesses into Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) has resulted in improved service, regulatory compliance and technology adoption, but little is known of how they operate. The aim of this paper is to gain insight into how the Kenyan inter-city matatu SACCOs are organised and have improved services, and to explore the transferability of this experience and the lessons it offers. The exploratory nature of the study, and constrained resources, necessitated that the research adopt a qualitative case study method. It was found that most of the case study SACCOs have addressed the root causes of poor service quality by shifting the remuneration of drivers from daily cash targets to salaries, and by requiring vehicle depreciation costing through compulsory contributions to the cooperative's capital savings from which vehicle acquisition and repair loans can be derived. Due to the particular shuttle-like nature of inter-city services and the considerable institutional support that exists in Kenya for cooperatives, the direct transfer of successes to other contexts is likely to prove difficult. Identifying the features of the inter-city SACCO model that have led to paratransit service improvements, and attempting to replicate these, may therefore be more effective than attempting to replicate the model in its entirety. These features are argued to be operator consolidation, accompanied by salaried drivers, systematic vehicle monitoring and compulsory vehicle depreciation costing. They can be adopted in other forms of paratransit organisation and regulation, but will require considerable adaptation to context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1080/23311886.2016.1219211,farm produce; farmer multipurpose cooperatives; marketing; performance

Data were obtained from 306 respondents who are management committees of 36 selected FMCS. Data obtained were analyzed with appropriate statistical tools. Thus, evidence from the result revealed that, the FMCS are capable of delivering various marketing services to their members. Findings also revealed that the FMCS performed various functions that facilitate marketing of their members farm produce as most of these marketing functions are performed to a great extent, but advertising and awareness campaigned as well as market survey and market research are not properly delivered as part of marketing functions. So in a bid to strengthen the potentials of FMCS towards effective marketing services delivery to members, the following recommendations are provided. The government should endeavor to partner with FMCS by providing them with expertise and supply them with productive resources; also the government should design a synergy between Nigeria Export Promotion Council and FMCS, so that farmers can export their produce to international market which will boost the contribution of agriculture to the GDP. Finally, the cooperative leaders should design and invest in research and market survey which will boost the competitiveness of cooperative in the competitive environment. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

Geological Survey (U.S.), 1996; European Environment Agency, European watersassessment of status and pressures, 2012). This type of pollution, even though not always due to agriculture (example of the catchment of Ambleville, county 95, France where the nitrate pollution is mainly due to sewers (2012)), has been largely related to the agricultural practices (Sci Total Environ 407:60346043, 2009). Taking note of this observation, and instead of letting it paralyze their actions, the agricultural cooperatives decided with Agrosolutions to act directly on the field with their subscribers to change the agricultural practices impacting the water and the environment. This article shows how the French agricultural cooperatives transformed the awareness of the raw water quality problem into an opportunity for the development and implementation of more precise and responsible practices, to protect their environment.

The current Abe administration has introduced so-called Farmland Banks to facilitate land transfers to expanding farms, including general corporations, which have long been banned from farmland access in Japan. The paper argues that farmland deregulation puts the incumbent local stakeholders of farmland governance, such as local agricultural cooperatives, local administrations, and not least farmers themselves, at risk of losing access to state support and influence. At the same time, the responsibilities for coordinating farmland consolidation have been placed onto the same local stakeholders. The state of local farmland governance has long been critical to impeding coordinated consolidation, whereas deregulation facilitates predatory corporate farmland use. In contrast, evidence from Hikawa Town in Shimane Prefecture shows how exceptionally strong local control over farmland enables consolidationalbeit in the defensive interests of the local incumbents. © 2016, © 2016 German Institute for Japanese Studies.",,10.1108/JOCM-12-2016-0262,Collective action; Governance; Greece; Ownership; Risk; Systems

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the ideas of Habermas and Luhmann, this paper interprets preference heterogeneity of cooperative members in terms of the precarious relationship between the categories of system and lifeworld. The argument is buttressed with a case study of an agricultural cooperative recently founded in Central Greece. Findings: The sensitivity of cooperatives to the lifeworld contexts of their members exacts the price in the form of the member preference heterogeneity problem. If this sensitivity is taken to be the constitutive characteristic of cooperatives, then the proposed argument hammers home their fundamental ambivalence, as they are necessarily fraught with the potential for internal conflict. Research limitations/implications: The paper urges for a radical rethinking of Georg Draheims thesis of the double nature of cooperatives. Double nature is shown to aggravate the member preference heterogeneity problem. Practical implications: The results of this study inform the cooperative leaders quest to strike a balance between the interests of their members and the demands of the external socio-economic environment. Originality/value: This research contributes significantly to the literature on collective decision-making costs incurred by cooperatives. The failure of cooperatives to balance the sensitivity to members interests and to the external environment is exposed as the root cause of the divergence and heterogeneity of member preferences. This heterogeneity is shown to boost collective decision-making costs. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",,10.5367/oa.2015.0209,Bioenergy; Ex ante impact assessment; Food security; Food value chain; Income generation; Waste

To enhance food security in this context, participatory action research can help to ensure sustained success while considering entire food value chains (FVC). This paper assesses the feasibility and potential success of upgrading strategies (UPS) as well as their assessment criteria as developed by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists. The results form part of a larger participatory research project conducted in two climatically representative regions of Tanzania: semi-arid Dodoma and subhumid Morogoro. This paper presents the findings with respect to food processing, waste management and bioenergy, along with income generation and market participation. Assessments on other components of the FVC, including natural resource management, crop production and consumption, are reported by Graef et al (2015). The assessments for food processing revealed preferences for preservation techniques, oil extraction processes and food storage devices for the semi-arid region. In contrast, in the subhumid region, the experts favoured food storage devices and preservation techniques. Assessments of waste management and bioenergy UPS for both regions indicated the importance of animal feed from crop residues, crop residues as mulch and compost from food waste, although with somewhat different priorities. Assessments on income generation and markets in both regions revealed preferences for savings and credit cooperatives and communication techniques, but also indicated that warehouse receipt systems and guarantee systems had a high impact. Assessments differed between the two different climatic regions, and to some extent also between the nationality of experts and their gender. The authors therefore attach importance to integrating different South-North and female-male awareness in assessments among scientists. Moreover, local and/or regional stakeholders and experts should be involved in developing site-adapted UPS for enhancing FVCs.",,,Agenda; Competitive advantage; Enterprise; Organizational resources; Resource-based view

The study employs a VRIO (valuable, rare, inimitable and organizational) model for the theoretical conception of constructs related to the resource-based view and competitive advantage. A case study was undertaken in a credit union, incorporating interviews at two levels of organizational management strategic and tactical as well as a questionnaire administered with two managers to identify relevant resources and a review of secondary data consisting of company documents. The study found that only one resource may be considered a generator of sustainable competitive advantage: human capital training. This was considered by the three sources to be valuable, rare, costly to imitate and exploited by the company. Two types of physical capital resources were considered to be generators of temporary competitive advantage: financial capacity and location. These appear in at least two sources, defined as rare and valuable and expensive to copy. Therefore, the organization gains a competitive edge guided by limited resources, namely human and physical capital. These findings provide important insights for the development of further studies, systematizing the resource-based view in a research agenda. This research has implications for academics, practitioners and policy makers. Explains the strategic assets that generate competitive advantage and which are essential for the survival of the company. The realization of the value of human resources for the company studied, emphasizes the importance and necessity of ensuring the satisfaction of the people and investing in training for obtaining sustainable competitive advantage.

These socioeconomic processes resulted in landscape?scale changes in biodiversity, ecosystem services and agricultural production. In parallel, large?scale abandonment of croplands, especially on sandy, salty or frequently inundated areas, became common. Abandoned croplands are usually sensitive to species invasions, and are hotspots of noxious weeds, posing threats both to agriculture and nature conservation. Grassland restoration on former croplands can be an effective strategy for suppressing these species. Thus, a common goal of nature conservation and agriculture can be the restoration of grasslands on former croplands to (1) suppress weed and/or invasive species in line with the policy Good Farming Practices, (2) support animal husbandry by creating meadows or pastures, and to (3) recover biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the present paper we report best practices of grassland restoration projects from Hungary. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of spontaneous grassland recovery vs. active grassland restoration by seed sowing in terms of the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as weed control and biomass production. Our results showed that grassland restoration on abandoned fields offers a viable solution for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services. Seed sowing ensures higher weed control and biomass production, but results in lower biodiversity compared to spontaneous recovery. Both restoration methods can be cost?effective, or even profitable even within a relatively short period of a nature conservation project. © 2016, Copyright: © 2016 Valkó et al.",,10.1007/s10745-015-9770-0,Agroecology; Brazil; Food sovereignty; Resilience

Using focus groups, a household survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets.

Results showed a large increase in the proportion of beneficiaries accessing extension services from private service providers and expressing satisfaction with CESDM, attaining higher dairy productivity in milk and in gross margins per animal per year. However, there was only a marginal increase in willingness to pay or paying for the services and the majority of beneficiaries continued to sell milk through informal market outlets. On aggregate, CESDM posted positive net benefits and multiplicative economic power with the best performing dairy chains multiplying every shilling invested 4 to 46 times. On average, beneficiaries earned KES 4993 per farmer at a cost of KES 353 for services, inputs and equipment. We conclude that CESDM can be a viable and rewarding approach for delivering extension services to smallholder farmers but it is necessary to strengthen farmer cooperative societies because those paying for private services are still too few to sustain remunerative private sector investment in extension service delivery.",,10.1080/2329194X.2015.1085320,

Abe, introduced a set of new economic policies popularly called Abenomics. One of the main components of the new policy was a drastic reform plan for the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA), the partys longtime loyal supporter. The announcement of the reform plan invited fierce opposition from the JA, which threatened to end its support of LDP in future elections. Why did Abe introduce the JA reform plan, even though it could lead to loss of electoral support for his party? Is he serious about carrying out the proposed reform plan, or is it just for show? This article analyzes the context of the JA reform plan from the standpoint of constructivist institutionalism focusing on policymakers ideas regarding party management.

Consumer attitudes are becoming more tolerant of insurance fraud in recent years. Recognizing that not all insurance fraud situations are created equal, we investigate variability in perceptions of moral intensity in dissimilar insurance padding situations in a 2 (to help others versus to profit self) × 2 (a small credit union versus a large online insurer) model and compared the results between two independent samples (college students/Millennials and an older adult population). We also investigated the impact of ethical predispositions (formalism and utilitarianism) on moral awareness and moral judgment using these four scenarios. The results suggest that the Millennials may exhibit more situationalism and more lenient judgments of collaborative versus unilateral ethical violations. In particular, 'for self' versus 'for others' comparisons show striking differences between the two age groups.

This speaks to issues of both increasing the size of the economic pie and how this income is distributed. The case is made that cooperatives can potentially generate higher rates of growth and more equitable growth, even in competitive economic environments. An important type of cooperative that is focused upon is one based on the linking of smaller farms into a cooperative. Economies of scale and scope as well in transaction costs can be captured by the cooperatives. Given cooperative governance, one would also expect higher levels of x-efficiency. Overall, cooperatives can generate relative high incomes to cooperative members, whilst remaining competitive with the traditional privately owned large farms. Critical to the success of the cooperative is a set rules and regulation that place them on a level playing field with the privately owned farm.

Secondary issues include analyzing the difference between technology security and information system security and examining the role that organizational insiders must play in maintaining information system security. The difficulty level is three, four, and five. This case could be used to supplement or cover an information security chapter in an undergraduate or graduate Introductory to Technology course. As part of a management curriculum, the case is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses. The case could also be used with an individual and group decision making chapter in Principles of Management, Organizational Behavior, and Organization Theory, or chapters which address the planning or controlling functions in Principles of Management. It can be taught in a single 75- minute class with two hours of student preparation outside of class in addition to time needed to read the assigned chapter. CASE SYNOPSIS Organizations face ongoing challenges to develop and maintain comprehensive systems to maintain information security. In order to do so, an understanding of both the technical and social aspects of an information system is necessary. Management must recognize the difference between information and technology security. By definition, an information system consists of (1) the environment, (2) the technology, and (3) the people. To have an adequate information system security strategy all three must be considered. The case involves an information security breach at First Freedom Credit Union. In this case, member credit card information was stolen, not by technological means but rather because of human error. The executives believed that they had adequate information system security, but were taken by surprise when their members' credit card information was stolen. The case addresses the issue of the financial services environment, the technology countermeasures that are currently in place, and the people who are using the information systems. A point is made that information is not only stored within computer-based systems, but is reproduced in the form of printed reports, backup tapes, emails, etc.",,,Seed management pattern; Tribal farmers

However, the external environment may influence producer organizations' room for maneuver in implementing effective quality management. This article assesses the influence of the relations between producer organizations, producers and other actors in the value chain on the capacity of producer organizations to implement quality management. Our analysis focuses on four Moroccan milk collection cooperatives that started using a milk analyzer with the aim of eliminating cheating by their suppliers. The cooperatives' room for maneuver in improving quality management was limited by the presence of competitors for milk collection and by the agro-industry's lack of transparency in the way its own quality controls were applied.

The success of cooperative banks in the past was grounded on efficiency advantages generated through peer-monitoring, social sanctions, and institutional trust. Institutional economic theory and anecdotal historical evidence suggest that these core institutional mechanisms also had an effect on the employment structure of early credit cooperatives. By examining the employment structure of current cooperative banks, we aim to provide insights to the question of how and to what extent original institutional mechanisms of credit cooperatives may still be functional. We use administrative establishment data from Germany and compare employment structures of banks by legal form. The results indicate that cooperative banks in comparison with otherwise similar private and savings banks are characterized by more stable employment, an older workforce, more extensive training activities, and a more homogeneous composition of employees.

Yet in the current context of climate change, in which we turn to genetics, irrigation or innovation in cultural practices to maintain production quality, could the mountain environment emerge as a solution for adapting to climate change in vine-growing? Here we explore the role of cooperative policies that may be deployed on the territorial scale, using an agent-based model. Our model was based on the viticulture of the Banyuls-Collioures AOC area, which is characterized by small-scale vine-growers and marked by widespread involvement in cooperative systems. The simulation results showed an important role of cooperative policies not only to conserve narrow production window and required vine quality, but also in respect of the emblematic landscape structure. These results should foster vine-growers to strengthen their cooperatives and adequately use these organizations to mitigate future climate change impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,Agricultural cooperatives; Export; Innovation; Internationalization

Its proper management enables a better access to inputs, the application of advanced techniques of agronomy and makes a profitable marketing possible. Globalization and the increasing asymmetry in the markets call for a modernization of cooperatives. Thus, to ensure their survival it is essential to address the challenge of globalization and market orientation. This paper establishes a typology of cooperative exporters based on a sample of 45 Spanish citrus cooperatives and analyses the existence of significant differences between them based on their knowledge of markets, market orientation and innovation. The results show that there are differences in knowledge of markets among those cooperatives that export through second grade cooperatives and those who export directly. Additionally, differences were also significant in innovation and market orientation among cooperatives that exported sporadically and those with an export plan. © 2016, Universidad del Zulia.

This allows credit unions to choose between different organizational structures: cooperative; convert to customer-owned banks or to demutualize. This article utilizes semi-structured interviews to analyse the key motivations for organizational change. It examines a number of credit unions and their conversion experience to customer-owned banks. It finds that adaptation of the credit union model was necessary to change customer perceptions, ensure future growth in the customer base and assets, and facilitate access to capital raisings with the credit rating of a bank.

,"participatory cooperative research: for the people, by the people, with the people",Hannan R.,Development in Practice,9614524,25,4,490-502,2015,Routledge,,"ABSTRACT: This article examines the program of agricultural cooperative (JA) reform initiated by the Abe administration in November 2013 and ending with draft legislation approved by the Diet in August 2015 for enactment in April 2016. The government linked JA reform to its broader program of economic reform in several ways: as an important item on the agenda of regulatory reform; as a trump card in the transformation of agriculture into a growth industry; and as a means to strengthen the international competitiveness of the domestic farm industry in order to facilitate further opening of Japans agricultural market. The Abe administration also had an additional, political objective in accomplishing JA reform  to weaken the political power of JA as one of the countrys most formidable and influential pressure groups. This article evaluates the nature of the reform program and its success in achieving its wider economic and political objectives. It argues that the reforms to date are both radical and limited. They are radical because they are unprecedented; on the other hand, they are limited because the extent of the change is relatively circumscribed and therefore its potential to achieve the governments broader economic goals as well as its narrower sectoral goals is relatively modest. © 2016 Japanese Studies Association of Australia.",,10.1080/09614524.2015.1031084,Civil society  Participation; Labour and livelihoods  Poverty reduction; Methods; Sub-Saharan Africa

Here, rural tourism is neither a simple, business-orientated project nor a step-by-step process of tourism development. It emerges, together with nested markets, in the rural agricultural domain. Farmers, residents and newcomers draw upon historical practices and cultural knowledge to create innovative, quality products and educational experiences that contribute to the sustainability of local agricultural livelihoods and cultural traditions. However, shifts in public sector roles and structural changes in the growth and power of the agriculture cooperatives exacerbate the tensions and conflicts evident within the community in this struggle for rural survival.

Sparse studies exist on the impact of name changes on revenue-cost performance in mutual financial institutions such as SACCOs. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a standard event methodology over a six-year period (2008-2013) to investigate the impact of name change on the return on assets (ROA) and operating profit margin (OPM). The study then uses a panel regression method to study the impact of name change on ROA and OPM for a sample of 212 deposit-taking SACCOs over the period 2008-2013. Findings: The results, which are robust for a variety of controls, provide evidence in support of a consistent positive association between name change and subsequent financial performance of deposit-taking SACCOs in Kenya. The positive impact of name change seems to be experienced about four years after the name change. The results reveal muted influence of regulation on name change and financial performance of SACCOs in Kenya. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses solely on deposit-taking SACCOs in a developing country context over a six-year period only. Extending the time period and including a sample of control SACCOs operating purely back-office service activities would add power to the analyses. Practical implications: The current study illustrates the contribution of name change on the financial performance of SACCOs in a developing country characterized by a vibrant SACCO sector. Overall, the results show that name change announcements signal an improvement in SACCOs future prospects. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the contribution of name change announcements on the financial performance of SACCOs in a developing country context. The study adds to the sparse literature on the impact of name change on the financial performance of mutual financial institutions that are not listed on the securities exchange. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,10.5901/mjss.2015.v6n3p751,Agro-industrial complex; Cooperative business; Cooperative enterprise; Peasant (farm) household; Personal subsidiary plot

Design/methodology/approach  The business model is taken as the structure and governance of the relationships between the focal firm and its exchange partners. The empirical analysis is based on a qualitative investigation, analyzing material collected at the Farming Cooperative Gran Cru. Findings  Several different coordination mechanisms were used to rethink the firm customer value proposition, showing a very complex and dynamic inter-organizational system: Process control mechanisms, knowledge suppliers and clan control mechanisms. The combination of mechanisms enables the firm to govern the extreme complexity of external complementarities and interdependence among activities and resources. Practical implications  The study is particularly helpful to managers because wine entrepreneurs and managers can influence their networks features and strategies, as well as the mechanisms for governance of the relationships and extracting customer value. Originality/value  The study seeks to enrich the debate on the strategy/structure fit by shifting the focus from the organizational to inter-organizational level of analysis. The analysis centers on boundary-spanning relationships between one wine firm and its partners and knowledge suppliers.

As a result of consolidation in agriculture, many farmers in developed countries have found themselves in complex cooperative structures in which market orientation may elevate capital-related membership benefits over the traditional patronage and farming-related benefits. This study utilized the heterogeneity in producer organization structures to examine the significance to farmers of membership in modern agricultural cooperatives. Survey data including 682 Finnish agricultural producers in the livestock sector enabled the subjective value of cooperative membership and the relationship with transaction cost benefits to be analyzed. The effect of vertical integration in cooperatives on the self-reported value of membership benefits was assessed with a sample consisting of members in three types of cooperative organizations: dairy marketing, dairy supply, and meat cooperatives. The findings confirm that a stable market channel is still the most important benefit that producers perceive as deriving from cooperative membership. Multivariate ordered probit analysis indicated that the market channel is equally appreciated by large and small producers, but the reduced uncertainty brought by a cooperative buyer is particularly valuable to farmers who are investing in farm expansion. The survey findings indicate that the more competition for the raw material from producers there is in an area, the greater is the pressure cooperatives may be under to develop their service offering in order to attract members. © 2015, Alh.",,,Fish farming; ICTs; Marketing; Rivers state; Temperature

There are two leading theories in finance that explain capital structure: the trade-off and pecking order theories. Focusing on consumer co-operatives in South Korea, the paper aims to analyze empirically what determinants have effect on the capital structure of consumer co-operatives and which of the two theories is more plausible. This study reveals that profitability and firm size have a significantly negative effect on leverage while tangibility and growth have a significantly positive effect on it. In conclusion, it seems that neither of the theories above perfectly accounts for the capital structure of consumer co-operatives because of the differences in governance characteristics between consumer co-operatives and IOB as well as in the costs of bankruptcy, agency, informational asymmetry and securities issuance.

Chaianov. The economists rehabilitation resulted from the changing conventions of public discourse towards the end of the Soviet era. Yet, Chaianovs return needs to be linked also with the official image of the rural economy in the preceding decade when in academic and political debates on private subsidiary farms the socialist village took on new contours. Household farming which had previously been condemned as either a petty-bourgeois mode of production or an indicator of the incomplete transition to socialism, was accepted as a component of socialist agriculture. Mirroring a new understanding of socialism, this paradigm shift was an important precondition for the broad public response to Chaianovs rehabilitation. In the end, the turn towards family farming and co-operation remained an intellectual and political phenomenon with barely any impact on the agrarian order itself. The economic legacy of the Soviet era and local power constellations prevented a fundamental change of the rural order in favor of household-based agriculture. © 2021 Institut National de Recherche Pedagogique.

Here we asked whether domestic dogs evaluate humans interacting with one another over neutral objects. In two experimental conditions, the dog's owner tried to open a container to get a junk object that was inside, then requested help from an actor sitting next to her/him, while the dog watched the interaction. In the Helper condition, the actor held the container stable to help the owner to open it. In the Nonhelper condition, the actor turned away and refused to help. In the Control condition, the actor simply turned away in the absence of any request for help. A neutral person sat at the other side of the owner throughout these interactions. After the interaction the actor and the neutral person each offered a piece of food to the dog. Dogs chose food randomly in the Helper and the Control conditions, but were biased against the actor in the Nonhelper condition. The dogs' avoidance of someone who behaved negatively to the owner suggests that social eavesdropping may be shared with a nonprimate species. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,10.18461/ijfsd.v6i4.641,agricultural co-operative; co-operative; conflict of interest; financial instrument; financing; shareholder

The risk of conflicts of interest plays a role in these misunderstandings in the way retained earnings, returns to agricultural products brought by co-op member and returns to equity capital. Such risks are identified and answers are proposed. © 2015. All Rights Reserved.",,10.1525/as.2016.56.3.442,Abe Shinz?; Aging society; Agricultural reform; Japan Agricultural Cooperatives; Tpp

Due to climate change and policy fragmentation household food security and nutrition remain a perpetual challenge, especially for women eking out a living on the periphery. One of the premises that this paper is based on is the assumption that women are prime producers of their communities food, which is mainly for food security. Inqolobane Yobumbano Secondary Co-operative (IYSC) could be seen as an initiative that entrenches this role, adding to the burden of womens care work and subordination. Contradictorily, the initiative offers women the opportunity to transform this role, empowering them and enabling them to take control of their lives in many ways. Issues pertaining to food security and insecurity are intertwined with womens struggle for land, which mirrors the unfinished business in post-apartheid South Africa. The case of IYSC is used to interrogate opportunities and challenges besetting the efforts of mainly women in Inanda township. The Secondary Co-Operative is an apex co-operative body formed in 2013 and it has four primary co-operatives. This association was formed with the primary purpose of improving the functioning of agricultural co-operatives within the Inanda area in dealing with food insecurity, poverty, unemployment and inequality. © 2017 Ndwakhulu Tshishonga.",,10.7160/aol.2015.070304,Capital structure; disparity; farmers' cooperatives; regions

In case of correct adjustment of capital structure, more precisely the ratio of equity capital and foreign capital, it is necessary take into account a number of factors which operate on the structure of capital, for example a variety of funding sources. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the development of the capital structure and capital disparity across the farmers' cooperatives from fourteen regions of the Czech Republic for time series 2009 - 2013. For this analysis is used the debt leverage indicators and method of comparative statics. Data are obtained and processed from the database of enterprises of Albertina. The financial and economic crisis lowered the debt to equity ratio and debt to assets ratio and the profitability ratios as well and the indicators reports V-shaped trend. The disparity of the ratio values among regions at the end of the monitored period seems not to be changed. Usually Prague as the region with the highest GDP per capita during the monitored period reports usually the extreme values in most ratios and higher deviations in debt ratios and lower deviations in profitability ratios. Also the impact of capital structure indicators on the profitability of cooperatives seems to be not significant during the monitored period.",,10.1016/j.jcom.2015.02.003,Collective action; Effective co-operatives; Family farming; Organisational and social capital; Social and economic incentives

Family farmers cannot seize economic opportunities, or influence policies that affect them. The experience of the French Farm Machinery Co-operative movement (CUMA) illustrates well how a movement of small farmers organised in co-operatives can contribute to the removal of the major barriers to the economic and social development of family farmers. Nevertheless co-operative performance is affected by pervasive incentive problems. CUMA history suggests how social capital is a critical resource in overcoming some incentive problems. The CUMAs succeeded in creating effective co-operatives through the development of a dense fabric of relations: (i) among the family farmers' members within their local co-operatives; (ii) between the local co-operatives; and (iii) through their network with a multiplicity of actors. Some lessons from this cooperative experience can be broadly useful to governments and development practitioners to help unlock the family farming potential in developing countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1111/apce.12058,Control; Cooperative principles; Cooperatives; Democratic governance; Monopoly capitalism; Production networks

It builds on four bodies of literature: cooperation, transaction costs, monopoly capitalism, production networks. The framework associates the specific principles that define the identity of cooperative organizations (self-help, member ownership, democratic control, financial participation, limited capital remuneration) alongside more general governance levels (embodied values, property rights, control, resource allocation). We then apply the same dimensions to production networks and propose a stylized networking model for cooperatives. We introduce market power, and identify two polarized types of networks: (1) heterarchical forms of coordination based on cooperation and mutual help, (2) hierarchical coordination based on exclusive direction. We compare both types with our normative framework providing examples and brief case studies for each network type. Recommendations to scholars and practitioners point at the opportunity to discriminate inter-firm relations and production development strategy in terms of the values of cooperation, at all governance levels. Die erweiterte Governance von genossenschaftlichen Unternehmen: Koordination zwischen den Unternehmen und Übereinstimmung der Werte: Mit diesem Beitrag wird bezweckt, einen Rahmen für die Analyse der Governance in Netzwerken genossenschaftlicher Unternehmen zu schaffen. Die Arbeit basiert auf vier Literaturbereichen: Genossenschaftswesen, Transaktionskosten, Monopolkapitalismus und Produktionsnetzwerke. Der von uns entwickelte Rahmen verbindet die spezifischen Prinzipien miteinander, die, neben allgemeineren Governance-Kategorien (verkörperte Werte, Eigentumsrechte, Kontrolle, Ressourcenallokation), die Identität genossenschaftlicher Organisationen definieren (Selbsthilfe, Unternehmen im Eigentum der Mitglieder, demokratische Kontrolle, finanzielle Beteiligung, begrenzte Kapitalrendite). Sodann wenden wir dieselben Kriterien auf Produktionsnetzwerke an und schlagen ein stilisiertes Netzwerkmodell für Genossenschaften vor. Anschließend führen wir das Phänomen der Marktmacht ein und identifizieren zwei Extrempositionen von Netzwerktypen: (1) ""heterarchische"" Koordinationsformen, die auf Kooperation und gegenseitiger Hilfe basieren, und (2) hierarchische Koordination, die auf exklusiver Anweisungsbefugnis basiert. Wir vergleichen beide Typen mit unserem normativen Rahmen, wobei wir für jeden Netzwerktyp Beispiele und kurze Fallstudien bringen. Unsere Empfehlungen an Wissenschaftler und Praktiker zeigen die Möglichkeit auf, bei den Beziehungen zwischen den Unternehmen und bei den Produktionsentwicklungsstrategien eine Unterscheidung in Bezug auf die genossenschaftlichen Werte vorzunehmen, und die, für jegliche Governance-Kategorie.

Los autores asocian a estas dimensiones los principios específicos que definen la identidad de las organizaciones cooperativas (autoasistencia, propiedad de los miembros, control democrático, participación financiera y remuneración limitada del capital), al mismo tiempo que niveles de gobernanza mas general (valores incorporados, derechos de propiedad, control y asignación de recursos). Los autores aplican entonces las mismas dimensiones a las redes de producción y proponen un modelo para las cooperativas. A continuación presentan el poder de mercado e identifican dos tipos polarizados de redes: (1) formas heterogéneas de coordinación basadas en la cooperación y en la ayuda mutua, (2) coordinación jerárquica basada en la dirección exclusiva. Se comparan estos dos tipos con el marco normativo de referencia, proporcionando ejemplos y breves estudios del caso para cada tipo de red.

Considering that SACCOs in Kenya lack the necessary resources to acquire the best information systems, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate MISs currently in use in the SACCO subsector to determine how well they are serving. Design/methodology/approach: Using the ISO/EC 25010 Software Product Quality Model, the quality of MISs operated by 215 Deposit-Taking SACCOs in the Kenya was evaluated to determine their level of performance. Findings: The results indicated that the MISs currently in use by the SACCOs serve them well in terms of functionality, efficiency, reliability, ease of use and portability. However, vendor support, technical training and implementation process are a big concern to the SACCOs. Practical implications: The SACCOs in Kenya need not look for other MISs as the ones in use satisfied the condition required by the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Product Quality Model. The areas that require attention are vendor support services by entering into contracts technical training and service level agreement; and good project management in software implementation.

Secondary issues include analyzing the difference between technology security and information system security and examining the role that organizational insiders must play in maintaining information system security. The difficulty level is three, four, and five. This case could be used to supplement or cover an information system security chapter in an undergraduate or graduate Introductory to Technology course. As part of a management curriculum, the case is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses. The case could also be used with an individual and group decision making chapter in Principles of Management, Organizational Behavior, and Organization Theory, or chapters which address the planning or controlling functions in Principles of Management. It can be taught in a single 75- minute class with two hours of student preparation outside of class in addition to time needed to read the assigned chapter. Case Synopsis: Organizations face ongoing challenges to develop and maintain comprehensive systems to maintain information security. In order to do so, an understanding of both the technical and social aspects of an information system is necessary. Management must recognize the difference between information and technology security. By definition, an information system consists of (1) the environment, (2) the technology, and (3) the people. To have an adequate information system security strategy all three must be considered. The case involves an information system security breach at First Freedom Credit Union. In this case, member credit card information was stolen, not by technological means but rather because of human error. The executives believed that they had adequate information system security, but were taken by surprise when their members' credit card information was stolen. The case addresses the issue of the financial services environment, the technology countermeasures that are currently in place, and the people who are using the information systems.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of CR on co-operants behavior and on organizational performance in co-operative organizations. Design/methodology/approach  This investigation proposes an investigation model and tests the framework using structural equation modeling. For this purpose, 263 valid questionnaires were collected from a research sample comprised of co-operants of the biggest dairy union of co-operatives in Iberia. Findings  CR has a significant impact on co-operatives members loyalty and on co-operatives performance. The model provides a wider comprehension of the CR concept and introduces both the drivers and consequences. Research limitation  This investigation is based on a sample of members of one union of co-operatives in the specific dairy milk industry. Practical implication  The results give new guidelines to redress the co-operatives traditional management, namely the management of intangible assets like reputation. Internal culture, satisfaction with management, image and communication can boost reputation and thus organizational performance and members loyalty.

Common and different features of principles of credit cooperative formation in Europe, USA, Latin America, and Asian-Pacific region are viewed. Experience of development of agricultural credit cooperation of Russia and its involvement in international cooperation programs are studied. As a research method, systemic approach to study of historical experience of organization of agricultural credit cooperation, as well as comparative, structural, and functional analysis, was used. It was determined that systems of agricultural credit cooperation, which develop in a sustainable manner, showed extraordinary feasibility in various manifestations of economic crises due to them being built on the basis of existing horizontal ties of shareholders and formation of effective management system, built on practical implementation of principles of ethical economy. Appearance and aggravation of internal contradictions in the system of agricultural credit cooperation are viewed. The authors come to the conclusion that these contradictions have deeper basis than peculiarities of national economy and are connected to differences between principal theoretical preconditions of emergence and development of credit cooperation. Various interests which lie in the basis of emergence of specific cooperative associations come to the surface of economic reality as initial factors, which, in the process of development, show their contradiction to general tendencies of development of national economy, tendencies in the global division of labor, and global competition in conquering markets for sales of agricultural products.",,10.1108/AFR-03-2014-0004,Agricultural cooperatives; Capitalization; Equity financing; Equity retirement; Ratio analysis; Rural electric cooperatives
,"the co-operative university: labour, property and pedagogy",Winn J.,Power and Education,17577438,7,1,39-55,2015,SAGE Publications Ltd,,"Purpose  The purpose of this paper is to describe an equity management and planning tool used by rural electric cooperatives (RECs) and based on the times-interest-earned ratio (TIER). The objectives of the paper are to construct a mathematical model that provides a rigorous foundation for the TIER approach, modify the approach so the rate of return on equity is a function of the cooperatives equity position, demonstrate how elements of the model can be used by RECs in setting electric rates that will enable them to accelerate the retirement of member equity, and derive a generalized form of the modified Goodwin formula that can be used by both RECs and agricultural cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach  Mathematical and graphical expressions of the TIER approach are developed. Simulations are used to demonstrate how RECs can set electric rates according to a target revolving period. The modified Goodwin formula is generalized to include the payment of cash patronage refunds through use of a growth model of an agricultural cooperative developed in Royer (1993). Findings  This paper demonstrates how TIER analysis and the modified Goodwin formula can be used by cooperatives to aid their decisions regarding debt and equity financing and their choices regarding cash patronage refunds, equity retirement, and growth. The paper demonstrates that cooperatives that fail to recognize the functional relationship between the rate of return on equity and the equity position may substantially underestimate the equity position necessary to meet interest coverage requirements and overestimate their ability to grow and retire equity. It also shows that RECs may be able to make substantial improvements in equity revolvement with only modest increases in electric rates. Research limitations/implications  The model developed in this paper has been simplified to focus on fundamental financial relationships. To apply this model, cooperatives may need to modify it to accommodate the complexities of their business operations. Practical implications  TIER analysis can provide a useful equity management and planning tool for both RECs and agricultural cooperatives. It also can be used by lending institutions to assess the financial health of individual cooperative organizations. Originality/value  Constructing a mathematical model that provides a foundation for TIER analysis, modifying the approach so that the rate of return on equity is a function of the equity position, demonstrating how RECs can use the model to set electric rates according to a target revolving period, and generalizing the modified Goodwin formula so it can be used by agricultural cooperatives are all original contributions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,10.1177/1757743814567386,Academic labour; co-operatives; higher education; Marx

Cooperative societies have significant contribution to the food security and poverty reduction. However, limited empirical studies exist in the study areas about the roles of cooperative societies on food security. Design/methodology/approach  Primary cross-sectional data were collected from randomly selected 400 households. The study also gathered secondary data from the cooperative associations and government offices for comparison purposes. The paper applied Heckman two-stage model to capture the effect of cooperative societies on household food security. Findings  The probability of the households to join cooperative societies and also ensure food security depends on various determining factors like institutional factors, demographic variables and rural functions. The paired sample t-test shows that the mean income and expenditure of the cooperative member households were 70 and 40 per cent higher in 2010 and 2011, respectively, than in the baseline. The two-sample independent t-test indicates that the mean income and expenditure of the member households were 47 and 32 per cent higher than the counterpart households. The Heckman model explains that cooperative societies have statistically significant, positive and robust effects on household food security at 1 per cent level. Research limitations/implications  A few variables might suffer from endogeneity problem, although theoretically insignificant and have no sound justification. The study also considers only two indicators of food security (income and expenditure), but the findings of the study would have been good and sound with several and composite food security index. Practical implications  Such impact studies on cooperative societies are limited in the study areas. Thus, this study helps decision-makers, cooperative analysts and other concerned bodies to give priority for cooperative societies so as to curtail the food insecurity problem. It can also make meaningful contributions to bridge the gap in the cooperative literature. Social implications  The present study can improve the understanding of cooperative societies in the country. The finding of this paper can serve as an input for university students, decision-makers and cooperative analysts. The result can also strengthen the economic justification for policy intervention on cooperative societies. Originality/value  Most studies in the areas address the financial performance, historical movement and opportunities and challenges of cooperative societies. This implies that more work is necessary to obtain a clear picture and broad spectrum about cooperative societies, and thus, this study addresses the effect of cooperative societies on household food security. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,Agency; Cooperative organizational structure; Cooperatives; Malaysia cooperative; Partnership theory

Design/methodology/approach - The data set used in this study comes from SACCOs' audited financial reports for the year 2011. The performance was estimated using return on asset (ROA) and financial sustainability was estimated using the ratio of total expenses to total revenue. Linear regression was used to investigate the determinants of financial sustainability. Findings - The results show that, about 61 per cent of the sample SACCOs is operationally sustainable and 51 per cent of the total sample is both operationally and financially sustainable. The average sustainability score was 127 per cent. On average, the results for profitability (measured by ROA) is higher than some of the results reported for standard microfinance in the region and globally. In terms of sustainability the result forecasts a promising future for financial cooperative business model as an alternative form of financing the poor. Research limitations/implications - Only SACCOs with audited financial statements were included in the study, thus the conclusion is limited to SACCOs with similar characteristics. Future work might consider extending the analysis to include SACCOs with non-audited financial statements. Practical implications - Based on the sample SACCOs can under good management can be used as a sustainable social conduit for financial access and social economic development among the poor in Tanzania. Originality/value - This study contributes in two ways. First, it contributes towards the scanty empirical literature on the performance of SACCOs in developing countries and in Tanzania in particular. Second, it provides provocative evidence which appears to contradict earlier and more pessimistic accounts and it challenges the ontology about extending member-based microfinance. Copyright © 2015.

It also explores how the link between institutional logics and practice variation leads to a particular performance level in the newly created practice. The Delphi research method has been used to test theoretical concepts, interviewing a panel of 24 experts. Results show that the influence of practice variation can become a key element in evaluating the performance of new practices in agricultural cooperatives. The results highlight the fact that it might be possible to find a balance between cooperative and capitalist logics, by implementing an appropriate governance structure. These results show how important it is for a cooperative group to communicate effectively, to maintain democratic management and links with the membership, and to give its administrators topquality training.

,exit and failure of credit unions in brazil: a risk analysis,De Carvalho F.L.; Montoya Diaz M.D.; Neto S.B.; Guimarães Kalatzis A.E.,Revista Contabilidade e Financas,15197077,26,67,70-84,2015,FEA,,"Prior to 2007, Uganda pursued a centralized strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction that placed greater emphasis on agricultural development as a means for empowering citizens in the rural sector where 80% of the population lives and derives livelihood through various forms of subsistence farming. Since coming to power in 1986, the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Government has pursued various policies such as Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) approach under the Prosperity for All (PFA) program. Instead of enriching all Ugandans, the PFA program has benefited few individuals who are politically well-connected to the ruling elite. Based on a historical comparative analysis of impact studies of MFIs and SACCOs in Uganda, we are inclined to further argue that the program has failed to stimulate economic development and reduce chronic poverty because its activities and operations have excluded the rural people who need them the most. Unlike traditional SACCOs that are owned and controlled by their members and rely on member savings and share capital, political SACCOs rely almost entirely on government loans channeled through the Microfinance Support Center (MSC) and Uganda Post Bank. The poor performance of rural credit programs in Uganda is attributed to widespread corruption and politicization of their operations. The greatest challenge facing political SACCOs in Uganda is how best to protect themselves from direct government control, while continuing to receive government funding.",,10.1590/1808-057x201411390,Cooperatives; Efficiency; Longevity; Microcredit; Survival

Ltd,,"This study aims to investigate the factors that affect the market exit of Brazilian singular credit unions from 1995 to 2009; it also identifies and lists the determinants of various types of market exits and analyzes whether profitability is a significant factor for credit union survival. This study was conducted with accounting data provided by the Central Bank of Brazil, which derives only from individual cooperatives, i.e. singular credit unions. Quarterly financial statements from these credit unions that were active from 1995 to the second quarter of 2009 were employed, totaling 71,325 observations for 1,929 credit unions. Based on survival and the model of competing risks (such as the Cox, Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, and Competing Risk models), the results show that there is no statistical evidence to ensure a correlation between profitability and credit union survival. The results also suggest that the size of credit unions plays a key role in their survival and longevity and that their funding and investment management are related to their survival and risk of market exit. In conclusion, the results confirm the initial idea that the duality inherent to credit unions - cooperative principles versus economic efficiency - might influence the stability, survival, and longevity of these institutions. Such results may also imply that a credit union embracing the rationale of a private bank will become more estranged from its members, something which will hinder its future operations and increase the likelihood of its exit from the market.",,10.1177/0973005215572460,investor owned firms; leadership in cooperatives; organizational behaviour research; Rural producers cooperatives; trust and commitment in cooperatives

The analysis suggests that cooperatives as organizational forms throw up special challenges to the OB researchers, as they are special types of organizations that incorporate business-like features of the investor-owned firms as well as the voluntary nature of nonprofits, thereby increasing the complexity of the context to make it an interesting area of research. For future research, OB researchers will have to go beyond the employee-centric research to include cooperative members as important constituent of the organization, specifically focussing on trust, commitment, organizational citizenship behaviour and leadership behaviour. The article identifies certain roadblocks in getting the attention of the researchers in the OB area and suggests certain ways to overcome these roadblocks. © 2015 Institute of Rural Management",,10.1177/1476127015585103,Corporate social performance; equity theory; executive compensation; stakeholder management; tournament theory

For the past thirty years in Greece, numerous women's agricultural co-operatives have been established in rural areas and scholars have articulated several aspects of their role in both women's life and the local development. A cursory glance at the history of the women's agricultural co-operatives in Greece and a review of the literature highlights the uniqueness of this type of entrepreneurship (a rarity in Europe) and their significant role for rural society cohesion, mainly in geographically and economically isolated rural areas. In this paper we employ a SWOT analysis to elaborate on strengths and weaknesses, which vary from co-operative to co-operative. Either bottom-up or top-down created women's co-operatives are currently a social innovation. Their strengths mainly concern economic independence and social inclusion of women in rural areas, while their weaknesses are mainly associated with funding, organization, administration, know how, culture, product promotion and marketing problems. Nevertheless, they are called upon to survive in a competitive environment; although difficult, it is one that provides opportunities that most likely can outweigh threats. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,10.1007/s11156-013-0408-2,Credit unions; Information and internet services; Technology; Value

Using the propensity score matching method, we show that credit union adopters offered borrowing members a better interest rate than non-adopters immediately after the recession of 20012002 and a similar rate when economy rebounded. Our results indicate that transactional websites offer credit union members more convenient services with no negative impact on the interest rate on deposits.

,agri-environmental management through collective action,Uetake T.,EuroChoices,14780917,13,3,29-34,2014,,,"Banking services (mobile money services and platforms) in most countries today is no doubt technology driven. In Nigeria, for instance, the introduction of electronic banking has brought some advancements and complications to the ways and manners in which banking services are performed. In fact, the resultant effect of techno-driven (technologydriven) banking services on savings and borrowing patterns of the rural poor cannot be undermined. This paper relied on data collected through questionnaire from a random sample of 250 respondents from rural Southwest Nigeria. A descriptive analysis of the data revealed average age of those surveyed to be 52 years with a mean household size of 6 members. Respondents' distribution by gender showed there were more males (53.6%) than females with 38.8% and 61.2% of the former and the latter having no formal education. Data analysis on available and accessible techno-driven banking services revealed use of mobile phones and occasional transactions from the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) as the most patronised. However, the result of probit model employed to ascertain drivers/enablers of technodriven banking services showed age, gender, household size, educational status, poverty level, power infrastructure and cooperative society membership as very important. While the coefficients of age, gender, educational status and cooperative society membership were significant and positive, those of household size, distance to banking facility, power infrastructure and poverty status were negative and significant. It is therefore, recommended that effort should be intensified at capacity building of respondents in order to catch up with the growing trend in technology advancement in the banking sector. Also, improvement in the dilapidated state of road and power and infrastructures in the study area is very crucial to effectively harness the benefit of mobile money services. © Isaac B.

With the growing awareness of environmental issues, improved approaches to agri-environmental management have become important policy issues. Previous studies on agri-environmental policies have focused on individual farmers rather than on collective action. However, some agri-environmental issues need to be managed by farmers co-operatively. Collective action can facilitate geographically appropriate management of resources, allow for shared knowledge among members thus increasing their capacities, and provide solutions for dealing with agri-environmental issues. However, sometimes, transaction costs can hinder collective action from being initiated. Moreover, farmers often need external support such as scientific knowledge, technical information and financial assistance. Thus, external help from public agencies or other interested bodies may be necessary to promote collective action. Many local and central governments encourage farmers and other stakeholders to take initiatives to manage the environment by themselves through various policy measures including technical assistance and financial assistance programmes. Collaboration with intermediaries is also necessary to facilitate state-community relationships. Governments can assist agri-environmental management, as opposed to interfering with it, through better agri-environmental policies that promote collective action. L'agriculture a des effets à la fois positifs et négatifs sur l'environnement. Les questions environnementales se faisant de plus en plus présentes, il devient important d'améliorer la façon dont les politiques approchent la gestion agroenvironnementale. Jusqu'à présent, les études sur les politiques agroenvironnementales se sont intéressées aux agriculteurs individuels plutôt qu'aux actions collectives. Certaines questions environnementales demandent cependant une coopération entre agriculteurs. L'action collective peut faciliter la gestion des ressources à un niveau géographique adéquat, permettre de partager des connaissances entre membres, et donc améliorer leur capacité, et offrir des solutions pour régler les questions environnementales. Cependant, les coûts de transaction peuvent parfois empêcher l'émergence d'actions collectives. En outre, les agriculteurs ont souvent besoin d'une aide extérieure comme des connaissances scientifiques, des informations techniques et de l'aide financière. Une aide des agences publiques ou d'autres institutions intéressées peut être nécessaire pour promouvoir l'action collective. De nombreux pouvoirs publics centraux et locaux encouragent les agriculteurs et d'autres parties prenantes à prendre des initiatives pour gérer l'environnement par eux-mêmes par le biais de diverses mesures gouvernementales comme l'assistance technique et les programmes d'aide financière. La collaboration avec des intermédiaires est également nécessaire pour faciliter les relations entre pouvoirs publics et communautés. Les pouvoirs publics peuvent aider la gestion environnementale plutôt qu'interférer avec elle, en mettant en place des mesures agroenvironnementales qui promeuvent l'action collective. Die Landwirtschaft hat sowohl positive als auch negative Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt. Mit zunehmender Wahrnehmung von Umweltbelangen hat die Verbesserung der Ansätze zum Agrarumweltmanagement einen hohen politischen Stellenwert erreicht. Bisherige Untersuchungen zu Agrarumweltpolitiken konzentrierten sich eher auf einzelne landwirtschaftliche Betriebe als auf ein kollektives Vorgehen. Einige Umweltbelange erfordern allerdings die Zusammenarbeit der Landwirte untereinander. Ein kollektives Vorgehen kann eine geografisch sinnvolle Handhabung von Ressourcen erleichtern, die Weitergabe von Wissen untereinander fördern und somit zu einer höheren Leistungsfähigkeit führen sowie zur Lösungsfindung bei Umweltfragen beitragen. In einigen Fällen kann es jedoch vorkommen, dass es auf Grund von Transaktionskosten nicht zu einem kollektiven Vorgehen kommt. Zudem benötigen die Landwirte oftmals Unterstützung von außen wie z.B. Kenntnisse aus Wissenschaft und technische Informationen oder Finanzhilfen. Daher könnte Hilfe von außen seitens staatlicher Stellen oder anderer Einrichtungen des öffentlichen Interesses erforderlich sein, um ein kollektives Vorgehen zu fördern. Viele Regional- und Zentralregierungen ermutigen die Landwirte und weitere Akteure, die Initiative zu ergreifen und sich der Umweltbelange selbst mit Hilfe von verschiedenen Politikmaßnahmen sowie technischer Unterstützung und Programmen zur Finanzierungshilfe anzunehmen. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Vermittlern ist ebenfalls erforderlich, um die Beziehungen zwischen Staat und Kommunen zu fördern. Die Regierungen können das Agrarumweltmanagement unterstützen, anstatt hier störend einzugreifen, indem sie bessere Agrarumweltpolitiken schaffen, die ein kollektives Vorgehen fördern.

ISSUE 5,166-173,2014,,,"The Brazilian government has been encouraging fish farming in cages in federal water bodies, including hydroelectric reservoirs. Despite the government support, it is a new activity and the production model still needs some adjustment to reduce the production costs and achieve sustainability. The aims of this study were to determine the appropriate stocking density of Nile tilapia in cages in a hydroelectric reservoir and to evaluate to what extent fish size selection could improve their uniformity. Twelve cages (6m3) were placed at the Fish Farmers' Cooperative of Santa Fé do Sul and Region, Ilha Solteira reservoir, São Paulo, Brazil (20°12'10?S, 50°58'31.15?W). In stage I (initial fish weight, 78g), four stocking densities were tested: D1-800, D2-2000, D3-2500 and D4-3000 fish/cage, with three replicates. At the end of this stage (average fish weight, 255g), the fish were selected into three sizes, except for D1. In stage II, four stocking densities were tested, designed to obtain the following final production: D1-100kg/m3 (800 non-selected fish/cage), D2-80kg/m3 (600 fish/cage), D3-100kg/m3 (800 fish/cage) and D4-120kg/m3 (900 fish/cage). The trial ended when the fish weighed 800g. By reducing the initial stocking density from 2500 to 800 tilapia juveniles per cage, there was no need for selection. The growth performance was higher, the feed conversion rate was better and the time taken to reach harvesting was shorter. Consequently, the production cost reduced and the operating profit increased. Using the lowest initial stocking density, the risk of disease outbreak was also lower, and there was no need to use drugs for disease control since the mortality rate and occurrences of disease and deformity decreased and the dissolved oxygen level inside the cages was higher. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,,Agricultural cooperative; Khuzestan province; Ordinal regression

Although several initiatives including demand side management measures have already been implemented, consumers from different backgrounds suffer from various drawbacks of quality supply. This paper explores the valuation of electricity quality from the perspective of domestic consumers in Hyderabad, India. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with 798 urban households. For analysis, we apply a scale-adjusted latent class model to identify heterogeneity in preferences and in variance-scale. The results confirm the hypothesis of highly heterogeneous household preferences and reveal limited preparedness of domestic users to pay for improved electricity quality and renewable energy. Further, most respondents prefer state owned distribution companies to private enterprises or cooperative societies. We argue that the estimated preferences, implying demand and willingness to pay for single attributes of electricity quality, can help policy makers to adequately incorporate consumers' interests into decision making. The results further indicate that domestic tariff hikes should not be used to finance extension of renewable energies or infrastructure investment to improve reliability in supply. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1057/jors.2013.162,Agriculture; DEA; Efficiency; Finance; Microfinance; Social performance

ISSUE,-,2013,,,"AbstractExpected daily FL ranges (length at date) of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha have been used throughout California's Central Valley to identify federally listed winter-run and spring-run juveniles in a mixed four-race stock. Accurate race identification is critical both to species recovery and to management of the water supply for 25 million people and a multibillion-dollar agricultural industry. We used genetic race assignment of 11,609 juveniles sampled over 6 years to characterize the accuracy of the length-at-date approach, specifically by testing two of its central assumptions: (1) juvenile FL distributions do not overlap between races on a daily basis; and (2) the growth rates that are used to project FL at date are accurate. We found that 49% of FLs for genetically identified juveniles occurred outside the expected length-at-date ranges for their respective races, and we observed a high degree of overlap in FL ranges among the four races. In addition, empirical growth rates were well below those from which length-at-date criteria were derived. Given the high degree of FL overlap between races, we conclude that modification of the length-at-date method will not substantially reduce identification error. Thus, we recommend that genetic assignment be used at least as a supplemental approach to improve Central Valley Chinook Salmon race identification, research, and management. © 2014, © American Fisheries Society 2014.",,,Cocoa; Cocoa sector; Fermentation; Haiti; ICCO; Local cooperatives; Niche market; North-South partnership; South-South relations

But the potential of Haiti's cocoa has never been optimized: it has long been sold on the international market in the form of ordinary unfermented cocoa. Only recently have producers become aware of the benefits of producing fermented cocoa. In 2009, thanks to technical assistance from the Peruvian cooperative CEPICAFE for the Haitian cooperative network FECCANO, and thanks to support from the French NGO Agronomes et Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (AVSF), their fermented cocoa output was immediately taken up and marketed by European firms, including the French fair-trade company Ethiquable. Since then, the global quality cocoa market has opened up to Haitian cocoa. At the local level, the economic, social and environmental impacts of this innovation are significant. There are two main lessons to be drawn from this experience: (i) exchanges between developing countries should be stepped up in agricultural assistance programs, as the ""success stories"" identified in the different countries involved have a higher potential for replication; (ii) collaborative business relationships, initiated some years ago now by certain buyers from developed countries, can provide more sustainable support for the development of family agriculture in developing countries. International cooperation, with innovative approaches such as the one adopted in this case by AVSF can, therefore, make an effective contribution to the agricultural development of developing countries. To consolidate the impetus given to Haiti's cocoa industry by cocoa fermentation, it is essential to focus interventions on increasing the output of quality cocoa, on better targeting of niche markets, on reinforcing small-producer cooperatives, and on improving local governance in the cocoa sector. © Auteur(s) 2013.",,10.1080/21598282.2014.930992,cooperative firms; Marxism; socialism

In this, an effort was made for economic analysis of marketing costs incurred by Jaipur dairy in milk marketing. The study was based on secondary data of Jaipur Dairy Cooperatives which were collected from the monthly progress reports, audit reports and other related records of Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation, Jaipur Dairy Plant, Jaipur as well as from the milk collection and chilling centers. In order to study the marketing cost which includes the cost of collection and processing of milk, the data were collected from Jaipur Dairy Plant on different aspects viz., chilling charges, transportation cost and commission to milk collection cooperative societies, water and electricity charges, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and interest on capital expenditure. The data were arranged in simple tabular form and simple averages and percentages by total costs were computed, unit costs were also calculated by dividing each cost incurred by the quantity of milk handled. It has been found that the average total cost of milk collection spent by Jaipur Dairy was Rs. 18.79 and the average total cost of milk processing was Rs. 2.33/1 during the year 2009-10. These unit costs of milk collection and milk processing are important for policy and decision makers when they make policies and developmental programmes related to dairy sector for boosting the economy.",,,Benchmarking; Best practices; Contract farming; Palm oil industry

Thus, the first purpose of this study was to specify criteria for performance benchmarking, and identify best practices in palm oil contract farming. Second, we also aimed at developing and implementing a benchmarking model with criteria for trading the products from palm oil contract farming. The approach to these goals was to collect data about palm oil marketing practices in the study area, and about contract farming economic status and practices. To test for validity or results, assigned trading practices were used for 3 months, and the results assessed qualitatively. There were three types of participants, namely (1) 73 farmers who joined the program, (2) the Wattana Agricultural Cooperative Oil Palm ramp, and (3) the Jiras Palm crushing plant. The best practices from the study overall fit the policy to ""improve quality - reduce costs -increase price "". The best practice for farmers was to improve fresh fruit bunch quality by adjusting the harvesting cycle, and to sell as a group or create a farmer network based on quality policy. The best practices at ramps included comprehensive and vivid grading criteria, trustworthy quality selection, price incentive based on oil palm fruit bunch quality, management policy, public relations, technical assistance to suppliers, guaranteed accurate weighing scales, and establishment of a harvest team. The best practices of crushing plants were to create incentives for customers, quality-based purchasing policy, and attention to transportation advantages.",,10.1016/j.jcom.2014.10.001,Agricultural cooperatives; Cooperative management; Ethiopia; Farmers' organizations; Financial audit

However, management deficits, including the lack of regular financial audits, poses a threat to the sustainability and commercial success of these local voluntary associations and the positive impact that they might have on the welfare of their members. This paper considers how the provision of financial audit services for agricultural cooperatives can be strengthened. We assess the current status of agricultural cooperatives in the country and the demand and supply of financial audit services for them. We then review the approaches taken in 11 other countries for providing financial audit services to agricultural cooperatives in order to identify approaches Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives might consider. Insights are gained on the need for capacity building within cooperatives on financial oversight, building internal incentives for cooperatives to have conducted regular financial audits on their accounts, addressing the deficit of auditors within Ethiopia, and creating reporting mechanisms so that any emerging financial problems within a cooperative are made known and addressed in a timely manner. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,Agriculture; Albania; Albanian Savings and Credit Union; Economic impact; Farming; Micro credit; Microfinance

Access to appropriate financial services is a critical factor for agricultural development and yet, due to the specific constraints that come with financing agriculture (reaching isolated rural areas, working with highly seasonal activities, agro-climatic risks, etc.), developing an adequate supply of financial services remains a challenge in most of agricultural countries. Agriculture is one of the most determinative sectors of the Albanian economy and the main working alternative of people living in the rural areas. Microfinance programs target both economic and social poverty. To assess the effectiveness of these programs, MFIs need to measure the impact on the borrowers, who in our case are the farmers. The goal of this research paper pertained to economic impacts analysis, and what their implication on the farmers' income and activity is. In general, the study has identified various positive impacts on the farmers' activities that proclaim that ASC Union services are useful and viable. To assess these impacts, 100 questionnaires were conducted in Central and North Albania, while SPSS Software program with the main purpose to show the level of involvement of the farmers in the micro credit program and a model based on two-way causalities, together with econometric tools such as regression, cross-tabulation and correlation analysis, to address the issues of impacts were used. Overall, our study found out that 27% of the farmers choose to borrow from ASC Union because taking out a loan from this credit union is easier than borrowing from another MFI, while 15% said that ASC Union has the lowest interest rate in the credit market for the micro loans. Furthermore, 87 farmers out of 100, who were 4 to 10 year-old-members of the credit union, had their income increased in the last 3 years, whereas only 13 farmers answered that there was no change in their income in those years. Moreover, the farmers who took out 2, 3, 4 or 5 micro loans admitted that the micro loan was useful and helped them to increase and improve their activities, while on the other hand the ones who took just one loan proclaimed that there is no change in their income or activities.",,10.1111/cjag.12015,

Or aujourd'hui, les chercheurs et directeurs de coopératives constatent une baisse de ces deux niveaux de participation. Ce papier a pour objectif de construire une typologie des adhérents de coopératives agricoles du secteur céréalier français au regard de leurs comportements de participation puis d'identifier les déterminants qui expliquent l'appartenance des adhérents à une des classes de la typologie à partir d'un modèle probit multinomial. Nous faisons l'hypothèse que les attitudes de confiance et d'implication organisationnelles manifestées par l'adhérent envers sa coopérative peuvent expliquer ces différences de comportements aux côtés de variables individuelles liées à l'adhérent et son exploitation agricole et de variables liées à la coopérative à laquelle il adhère. L'analyse des comportements de participation permet de regrouper les 290 adhérents de l'échantillon en trois classes distinctes: «les individualistes», «les bons soldats» et «les engagés». Les résultats du probit multinomial sur ces 3 classes montrent notamment un effet significatif de l'attitude d'implication organisationnelle, de la présence de stockage à la ferme et de la taille de la coopérative sur la probabilité d'être individualiste par rapport aux deux autres classes. When a farmer joins an agricultural cooperative, he or she undertakes to participate in the cooperative economically, as a co-operator, and also in its administration, as an associate. Yet, today, researchers and directors of cooperatives are observing a drop in member participation in both spheres. The goal of this paper is to build a typology of the members of grain farmer agricultural co-operatives in France, based on the members' participation, and then use a multinomial probit model to identify the factors that come into play and result in a member belonging to a given category in the typology. We make the hypothesis that attitudes with respect to organizational involvement and the member's confidence in his or her co-operative can explain these differences in behavior, along with individual variables tied to the member and his or her farm business, and variables associated with the co-operative to which the member belongs. Following the analysis of the participation behavior of the 290 members in the sample, the members can be grouped into three distinct categories: ""individualists,"" ""good soldiers,"" and ""engaged."". © 2013 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.",,,Cooperative; Food science; Milk; Multicriteria; Quality management

In the first part the author examines the socio-economic context: changes and problems in the agrarian and social structure caused by privatization based on the doctrine of neoliberal capitalism, refeudalization of village and agriculture, war consequences, intense social stratification and 40% fall in agricultural production, compared to 1988 and 1989. In the second part the author presents the crisis and implosion of the oldest Croatian infrastructure unit for rural sociological research and two research projects about the Croatian village in transition, settlement network and network society done in the Institute for Social Research in Zagreb. The third part is about the journal's logistics. Systematic rural sociological research lost all financial support in the last decade of 20th century which caused the final exodus of researchers. Along with the desintegration of the rural sociology school in Zagreb, it meant the loss of institutional support for the scientific rural sociology periodical. The highest price of the wrong policy was paid: human capital was squandered and the research field lost. The Institute's other research teams could not back up the very specialized journal of rural sociology. The fourth part of the presentation deals with the new concept of overcoming the crisis, editorial policy, changes in the Board and Council and the new profile of the journal which eventually changed its name in 2006. The original concept from 1963 was broadened and it comprised the cooperation of the Institute's research potential with contributions from sociology and other similar disciplines whose primary interest was social, economic and cultural development, based on rural, urban and spatial research, agroecology, protection of ruralism and bioethics. The journal's profile was defined as problem-solving and Rural Sociology remained the primary scholarly journal with the same structure and publication frequency. The fifth part is dedicated to the journal's achievements, primarily its most valuable works which defined the profile of the new series. The journal basically overcame the crisis and made up for the lost time, money and human potential by opening up to contributions from other scientific disciplines (first about the ruralurban continuum, settlement network and social processes in space, then about religious and other research in the Institute), and to foreign authors. Because of their excellence the author singles out 12 contributions by home authors and 9 thematic issues among which stands out the jubilee issue for the 40th anniversary of the continued publication of the first Croatian sociology journal. It was entitled ""People who created Rural Sociology"". Other special issues with their recent and well-founded theories and methodology include village in transition, network of settlements and network society, islanders and island communities and agricultural cooperatives. Due to a large number of scientific works (six out of ten), based on experimental research of the Croatian society and village, Rural Sociology is a valuable and visible publication in the world scholarly community; there is reference to works published in it in eight world data banks. © 2013 Institute for Social Research in Zagreb - All rights reserved.",,10.1590/1234-56781806-9479005301006,Cooperative; Family agriculture; PNAE

We analyzed 19 diagnostics carried out in 2011 in family agriculture cooperatives from different regions of Minas Gerais State.

The study was based on two national surveys - one directed at a wide range of non-school state, private and cooperative organisations; the other at primary and secondary schools. The specific objective was to determine the extent to which the promoters and facilitators of EE/ESD have adopted the new trends and concepts emerged in this area, taking into account the fact that on-going initiatives may follow two differing approaches: i) a more naturalist and traditional approach based on natural scientific knowledge, and ii) a newly-developing and more innovative approach that places greater emphasis on the close ties and dynamic relationships between environmental quality, socio-political and socio-economic factors. Notwithstanding controversies arising for differing reasons (inertia/conservatism or complaint/contestation), the aim of this new approach is to achieve a more significant role for sustainable development in the broad social field of citizenship education and mobilising support for sustainable development. By reporting some of the most representative results, our aim is to contribute to a description of EE/ESD based on empirical observation. One finding, for example, refers to the persistent narrowing of the field of action that results from the predominance of ecological over civic issues. The general picture, despite some exceptions, is of initiatives dominated by traditional formats and themes (e.g. urban solid waste, nature conservation) and an underestimation of other areas of equal importance for sustainable development, such as greater coordination between schools and local communities in dealing with problems related to socio-economic, health, urban planning, quality of life, etc. Trend that is also evident in the excessive weight given to younger students, to the detriment of a wider approach that would broaden the scope of EE by including the entire age range of school communities, and a model that involves more effective ties with local communities, as described above.",,10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n2p483,Advancement; Cooperative societies; Craft and artisans; Role; Rural economy; Socio-economic

Survey design was adopted to conduct this study. Data was collected with the help of a self-administered researcher-constructed Questionnaire administered on 400 members of craft and artisan cooperative societies that were purposively selected. A pilot test of the instruments gave reliability estimates of 0.79. Data was analyzed descriptively using frequency, simple percentage and rank-order respectively. Results obtained (partial listing) indicated that education (of members) is a significant indicator that can effectively mobilize cooperative societies to attract government presence for assistance, lack of educated members could hinder the leadership structure of the group. Meeting frequently (usually weekly) could help to sustain cooperative societies and also serve as a catalyze for sharing of knowledge and new ideas which could be effective in improving business, solving personal and group challenges as well as increase work productivity. The Osusu scheme could help to abate poverty and solve the problem of insufficient and lack of fund which a significant population of craft men and artisans face often times. Finally, result shows that insufficient fund, migration, non governmental support, corruption among leaders etc. are some of the limiting factors to the optimum performance of craft and artisan cooperative societies in the study area. It was therefore concluded that organize effort to mobilize craft and artisans for cooperative spirit in the study area, and anywhere else, could assist to increase access to fund, dissemination of information and innovations, and reduce poverty.",,10.1111/apce.12048,Agricultural cooperatives; Internal governance; Market shares; Marketing strategies; Public policies

The study analyzed financial performance from 2007 to 2012 and determined members satisfaction of services rendered. It used semi-structured survey instruments, personal interview, and focus group discussion to gather data. Findings of the study revealed that members savings were not sufficiently protected. However, members were very satisfied with almost all of the services offered by the credit union. The study concludes that there is a need to improve its portfolio quality and liquidity management as evidenced by a high rate of loan delinquency. To ensure more sustainable operations, it is recommended that management exert effort to increase net loans receivables but at the same time address members high delinquency rate for loans. Additional investment on liquid assets is suggested for loan portfolio to generate more revenue and increase the net institutional capital. It is further recommended that future studies would include governance and organizational performance particularly on credit management processes to complement the results of this study. © 2014, University of San Jose-Recoletos.

Using a recent innovative approach termed the ""Wallet Allocation Rule (WAR)"" this research investigates whether measuring satisfaction relative to other competitors used exhibits a stronger correlation to share of deposits compared to measuring absolute satisfaction with the focal firm/product. Design/methodology/approach: A survey approach was used with a sample of 4,712 banking customers across the USA. Using the WAR, each respondent's satisfaction ratings were transformed into relative rankings and used to estimate their share of deposits. Findings: The results confirmed that at both the individual and the aggregate level examining relative ranked satisfaction correlates strongly with customers' share of deposits. At the individual level relative satisfaction explains 55 percent of the variance in share of deposits, as opposed to only 9 percent for absolute satisfaction. Practical implications: The findings indicate that managers need to rethink their current approach to satisfaction measurement and consider measuring their customers' satisfaction relative to competitors used. Furthermore, using aggregate level absolute satisfaction in managerial decision making can be misleading. Originality/value: This research provides a significant contribution to both the banking literature and the scientific literature in general by examining the robustness of a relative metrics approach within the retail banking and credit union market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,Breeding; Equestrian sport; Herds; Leisure horse riding; Stud stations

Four years later, in response to the progressing post-war reconstruction, intensive growth of state-owned farms and farmers' cooperatives, another stallion stud was created in Braniewo.

Horses from the two studs in the Province of Olsztyn were used for work in farming, for transport as well as for recreation and sports horse riding. Some of the horses could also be seen in historical films. However, the technological progress in farming gradually depreciated the role of horses, which led to a decline in horse breeding.

Our objective in the above discussion is to advance a conceptual framework using new institutional economics theories that draws attention to the importance of the organizational structure of contractors for the design of the proliferation of contracts increasingly governing agricultural production.

Beginning in 1990, a series of different policies have been implemented by the Chinese government to promote farmer cooperatives (FCs). This article aims to explore the functioning of FCs on the basis of the type and scope of the services they provide and their connections with the rural communities. The findings show that activities carried out by FCs help to extend farmers' engagement in value-chain participation and management. FCs, as organizational innovations, also provide opportunities to bring knowledge providers and farmers together. Some FCs are starting to coordinate activities for farmers, rural communities and local government to make better use of collective resources. Four types of FCs are identified in the research: commoditybased FCs, community-based FCs, specialized technology providers and credit service providers. The emergence of these four types of FCs is embedded in broader institutional developments. The government mainly promotes commodity-based FCs and specialized technology-providing FCs. Companies focus on commodity-based FCs, and research institutes and development organizations are involved in community-based FCs. These findings imply that an integrated and broader view of policies is needed to promote the development of FCs in the long run. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2014.",,,Credit union; Customer satisfaction; Marketing services

The aim is to show the specifics of the collectivisation of Soviet agriculture, using the example of Kazakhstan. The peasants were first given some land, only to have it taken it away over the course of several years, during the process of collectivisation. The poor farmers, especially those who lacked good civil morals, perceived the process chance to control the future development of the countryside. It seems most of them did not see or were not able to see the purpose of the changes in the social structure of the village, or especially the real intentions of the communists. Any manipulative ideological influence on the countryside is very harmful in its effect, and the consequences are difficult to remove even after a long period of time.

This paper is motivated by recent reforms to the rural credit market designed to encourage increased lending, particularly to farmers. Little is understood about the lender-borrower relationship in rural China. This paper fills that gap. Design/methodology/approach: The paper investigates relational attitudes between 120 loan officers at RCCs in China's costal Shandong province, paired with a field survey using matched questions to 394 farm households in the same region. Pairing lenders' perception toward borrowers regarding RCC microcredit lending mechanism, against borrowers' perception toward lenders and how themselves were perceived by lenders in the same regards, the paper investigates the degree of disconnect between lenders and with distinct cluster groupings based on their perceptions, the paper analyzes the influence of demographics on the borrower and lender cluster memberships. Findings: The paper identifies four borrower clusters and two lender clusters. Borrower clusters are segmented on credit access and satisfaction with their rural lender. The paper also identifies two lender clusters, segmented principally on financial incentives and lending activities. While all lenders view farming with higher regard than farmers believe they do, one cluster is clearly pro-farmer while the second is somewhat indifferent. Indifference is more related to current portfolio activities. The paper draws conclusions that policy initiatives should be put in place at RCCs that close the gap between lender and borrower in their credit relationship. Rural lenders should concentrate on advocating RCCs' care and trust toward agriculture and farm households. At the institutional level, effort should be extended to train a dedicated team of loan officers that specialize in servicing farm households with standardized lending practices. This research provides financial institutions with outreach mechanisms to borrowers, while also training lenders to borrowers' sensitivities. Originality/value: Management studies of RCCs are few. This is the first paper that the authors are aware of that studies farmer and lender attitudes on the same scale. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,10.5325/utopianstudies.26.1.0058,Class; Cooperatives; Ethnic identity; Food politics; Freret neighborhood; Gender; Great depression; New deal; New Orleans; Race; Socialism; World War II

Hermes fervently believed that public control over industry and government would revitalize democratic institutions and eradicate political repression, institutionalized racism, and corporate capitalism. Established in 1941 as a cooperative grocery store for working-class Freret Neighborhood residents, the Consumers Co-operative Union (CCU) was the physical manifestation of Hermess utopian vision. For more than twenty years, the CCU was a space for exchanging local and national ideas about economic cooperation, racial justice, and political reform. Indeed, Hermes depended on a far-reaching New Deal support network that transcended his neighborhood and bridged political, racial, gender, and class divides. However, this coalition disintegrated in the face of white flight, anti-Communist hysteria, and urban economic decline in the 1950s. I contend that while particular depression-era neighborhood politics nurtured the CCU, larger national economic, political, and cultural trends ultimately confounded the cooperatives ability to create sustained economic change in Freret. © 2015.

If co-operatives would be too much oriented to enlargement or economic growth, theymight easily pay no attention tomembers' participation which is one of the priorities in co-operatives. It could lead to losing the value of co-operatives. So it is important to adjust the balance between members' participation and economic growth. This paper focuses on the role of board of directors in doing that. It aims to examine how effectiveness of the board influences members' participation and the participation has effect on performance of co-operatives in the case of iCOOP Korea. The variables such as communication with members and usage of management skills and knowledge are employed asmeasures of the effectiveness of the board in decision-making process. The data are collected by survey the respondents of which are 222 directors of 30 primary co-operatives. It is analyzed by Structural Equation Model. The findings of the research are as follows. Firstly, communication of the board with members increases the members' democratic participation, and the increased participation contributes to improving the financial performance. Secondly, management skills and knowledge of the board does not have significant relations with the level of members' participation, even though members' economic participation has significantly positive relation with the financial performance. The findings imply that members' voluntary participation will be increased when boards of co-operatives try to reflect members' needs in the decision making processes, and it can help the co-operatives improve their financial performance. It suggests a clue for the trade-off between the value of co-operatives and growth of business which many co-operatives are trying to resolve. © 2014 The Authors.",,10.1016/j.jcom.2014.03.003,Africa; Farmer co-operative; Governance; Institutional form; Poverty reduction; Spillover

This unpacks the relationships between the different internal and external actors in co-operative governance, and the different processes (or areas of activity that the co-operative is engaged in). I examine how a balance can be achieved in the relationships, and how this can then affect the balance in the economic and social goals of the process areas, all of which can lead to a spillover effect impacting poverty. I also discuss social capital, and its place within co-operative governance. I explore how the relationships and processes influence the building and deployment of social capital by co-operatives to impact poverty at the household and village levels.

This study thus aims to investigate the main factors that inspire rural people to join into the cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected relevant primary data from 400 sample households using a special household survey designed for this study. The study also reviewed different secondary materials. The collected data were analyzed using the two-sample t-test principle and cooperative participation probit model. Findings: The finding of the binary choice model illustrates that information access, special skill, membership in rural association, frequency of attending a public meeting/workshop, household head education, credit access, training access, number of family members in school, distance to main market, availability of infrastructures, farmland ownership and farmland sizes are the major explanatory variables that have statistically significant (p-value <0.05) influence on the rural people joining in the cooperative societies in the study areas. Research limitations/implications: This study was based on a cross-sectional survey. As a result, the finding may be subjected to some limitations though the study made all possible efforts to minimize the limitations. Practical implications: Many studies found that cooperatives are a basis for food security. Accordingly, the government can increase a number of cooperative societies in the region by giving more focus to knowledge- and awareness-based instruments like education, information center, rural associations, communication services and roads. These campaigns can attract more people to join the cooperatives and then get the different economic and social advantages from the cooperatives in order to ensure household food security. Originality/value: Some studies found that state, leadership, success history of the cooperative and autonomous status are the most important factors that determine not only the expansion of cooperatives in terms of a number of and types but also for the success of the cooperatives. This study, however, found the importance of information- and knowledge-based mechanisms as a basis to attract more people so that increase in a number of and types of the cooperative societies.

This study investigates why different producers make different choices, looking at both material and immaterial costs and benefits of the two choices. A qualitative study from Chiapas (Mexico) finds that a main reason for not choosing the co-operatives is the production requirements that follow organic certification. A survey on production costs confirms that members of an organic co-operative have more work hours than non-members in the same area. A probit analysis indicates that both coffee plot size and number of working household members influence the producers decision on sales channel. However, the study also finds that aspects not related to the organic production requirements can affect the choice, such as the level of trust in co-operative leadership, and the co-operatives payment systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,Marketing cost; Marketing margin; Milk and milk products; Percentage margin

Industry structure and information asymmetries can also lead to underinvestment in product quality, even when property rights are well defined. In this article we empirically examine whether the voluntary formation of a marketing cooperative was able to mitigate market failures that led to the production of inferior-quality fish. Specifically, we use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to measure the impact that the Copper River Fishermen's Cooperative, an Alaskan salmon marketing cooperative, had on ex-vessel salmon prices and salmon quality measures. We find that the cooperative was able to improve product quality, as well as attract and sustain a higher price for its salmon. Our findings provide empirical support for many of the key tenets of cooperative theory. Specifically, we find evidence that marketing cooperatives can address existing market failures, that marketing cooperatives can have advantages in high-quality product markets, and that over time, as a result of their success, marketing cooperatives may lead to lasting producer benefits even though they become obsolete due to nonmember free-riding. © The Author (2014).",,10.1108/QMR-10-2012-0045,Arts marketing; Charities; Dance companies; Sensemaking

Variables that significantly influenced monthly net farm income were: gender (t = 3.913), farm size (t = 4.100), number of employees (t = 6.126), access to storage (t =-2.132), grading of products (t = 3.712) and access to extension services (t = 1.757). Recommendations suggested include: enabling accessibility through the development of better infrastructure in the form of storage facilities, roads for transportation and communication systems; and the formation of marketing cooperatives to overcome high transportation costs, small size of transport and individual small marketing output problems in order to attract and penetrate high value-markets. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.",,10.3167/fcl.2015.710106,Anti-Mafia; Community; Cooperatives; Divisions of labor; Mafia; Sicily
,revisiting a standard theory of cooperatives: a behavioral economics perspectives,Marwa N.,Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences,20392117,5,6 SPEC. ISSUE,117-121,2014,,,"The literature on cooperatives often conceptualizes cooperativism as an organized effort to embrace community participation. Through the analysis of agrarian cooperatives in Sicily that were formally established to counter the Mafia and by ethnographically exploring the notion of community for cooperativism, this article aims to problematize this idea of cooperatives as community economics. It proposes an anthropological approach that critically analyzes divisions of labor and the internal factions divergent concepts of community. In Sicily, workers in anti-Mafia co-ops recognize a sense of community and way of life in Mafia-influenced mobilizations outside the cooperative environment, contrary to the co-op administrators legalistic views of community. The article illuminates how the fact that oft en co-op members draw on different ideas of community can lead to contradictions and tensions, especially as there are different social realities underlying those ideas. © Stichting Focaal and Berghahn Books.",,10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n6p117,Behavioral economics; Cooperatives; Neoclassical rational choice theory

Carcass samples of 250 Hanwoo steers were collected from National Agricultural Cooperative Livestock Research Institute, Ansung, Gyeonggi province, Korea, between 2011 and 2012 and genotyped with the Affymetrix Bovine Axiom Array 640K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Among the SNPs in the chip, a total of 322,160 SNPs were chosen after quality control tests. After adjusting for the effects of age, slaughter-year-season, and polygenic effects using genome relationship matrix, the corrected phenotypes for the sensory evaluation measurements were regressed on each SNP using a simple linear regression additive based model. A total of 1,631 SNPs were detected for color, aroma, tenderness, juiciness and palatability at 0.1% comparison-wise level. Among the significant SNPs, the best set of 52 SNP markers were chosen using a forward regression procedure at 0.05 level, among which the sets of 8, 14, 11, 10, and 9 SNPs were determined for the respectively sensory evaluation traits. The sets of significant SNPs explained 18% to 31% of phenotypic variance. Three SNPs were pleiotropic, i.e. AX-26703353 and AX-26742891 that were located at 101 and 110 Mb of BTA6, respectively, influencing tenderness, juiciness and palatability, while AX-18624743 at 3 Mb of BTA10 affected tenderness and palatability. Our results suggest that some QTL for sensory measures are segregating in a Hanwoo steer population. Additional WGA studies on fatty acid and nutritional components as well as the sensory panels are in process to characterize genetic architecture of meat quality and palatability in Hanwoo.

These data justify the need to analyze the cooperative principles in the success of agricultural cooperatives in Zulia State. The research was conducted in the counties located at the South of Maracaibos Lake, a questionnaire to 51 cooperatives and interview to cooperative specialists were applied. Overall rate of success factors (IGFE), index review of success factors (IOE), and the index of productive activities (IAP) which have been subjected to correlation and means tests: success rates were constructed. The results emphasize that the principles with high average values and statistical significance in successful cooperatives are democratic management (0.7059), equal economic participation of partners (0.5233), education, training and information (0.4560), cooperation between cooperatives (0.4882) and commitment to the communities (0.3331). A significant correlation (P<0.01) between the IGFE (0.598) and IOE (0.598) with the dependent variable IAP was observed.

Two main research questions are addressed: first, what is the most appropriate micro-finance institution (MFI) organizational structure to maximize the economic benefits of micro-insurance? Second, what are the financial management and wider economic benefits of the use of micro-insurance by MFIs? Design/methodology/approach  To address our two research questions, we used a semi-structured interview protocol, informed by the organizational economics literature, to interpret the data collected from our field cases. We believe that these intrinsic qualities of case study methodology are particularly apt in the present study, given the complex and emergent nature of micro-finance and micro-insurance in low-income countries such The Gambia. By focusing on case studies in a single country, we also to some extent help control for variations in business environment that could confound interpretations of field data obtained from different jurisdictions. Findings  The results of our study suggest that the mutual (cooperative) structure of credit unions is likely to be the most cost-efficient and effective organizational form for reducing information asymmetries, agency problems and transaction costs. We also observe that micro-insurance can help reduce the risk of loan defaults, thereby increasing returns on savings and lowering the costs of debt. As such, micro-insurance stimulates the demandsupply of financial intermediation in less developed countries and so helps promote economic development. In addition to contributing new insights, our findings have potentially important commercial and public policy implications. Research limitations/implications  We acknowledge that our research is subject to inherent limitations such as the focus on three interviews in three different types of MFI organization while excluding other structural forms of organization such as government-owned/sponsored organizations. Nonetheless, the organizational characteristics of the cases examined in the present study are representative of most MFIs in developing countries. Given the prevalent hierarchical nature of corporate systems in sub-Saharan Africa, the views of the interviewees are also deemed to reflect those of other board members. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the conclusions from our research may need to be tempered in line with these inherent limitations with the research approach adopted. Practical implications  The insights obtained from our Gambia-based research could be generalized to developing countries elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, and indeed, other parts of the developing world. Consequently, the study could be of interest and relevance to international financiers (e.g. the World Bank), aid agencies, governments and other development organizations. Originality/value  Despite its evident business and development potential, academic management research on micro-insurance, and in particular, its role in supporting micro-finance initiatives, is still very much at an embryonic stage. Our study thus seeks to fill this knowledge gap. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,10.1556/SocEc.34.2012.3.6,C12; C25; co-operative; contract enforcement; D23; Tobit model; transition economy

The selection of enterprises has been implemented on base of differentness in the enterprise form, in the acreage of managed farm land and a differentiation of the enterprise subject. From a comparison of volume and structure of the supports it results that an agricultural cooperative uses a wide spectrum of particular types of subsidies, which is caused by a big acreage of almost 7 800 ha with orientation to both the plant and the animal productions. Similar situation is in the valued joint-stock company. Without received subsidies the economy of private farmer would be unprofitable in both the years. In monitoring it was proved that differentiation of enterprise activity in form of raw material process in excess of framework of agricultural basic industry decreases dependence of the income from operations on obtained financial means in form of supports. From the mentioned facts it is obvious that the received financial subsidies significantly positively influenced the operating results of all agricultural enterprises where the basic activity subject is plant and animal production.

The inquiry offers what we consider to be the first synthesis of the evolution of Romanian cooperatives from the perspective of social economy. The article presents relevant information for understanding and explaining the conditions that facilitated both successes and failures of rural and urban cooperatives in Romania. The study reveals an unprecedented aspect of cooperatives precursors associated to the pre modern trade and with the precursors of the merchants that operate on the capitalist market, the fact that they had a fundamental moral resource: the mutual trust of the stakeholder partners. The capitalist merchants involved in mass trade that would eventually form a consistent part of the Romanian cooperative members would have been rather interested to gain money, to surpass the problems of the competition, than to cultivate with priority the principles of honesty, fair play, mutual trust, as part of the professional ethos. Thus, a moral resource indispensable to business, part of the moral profile of the cooperative stakeholders, available in the practice of the middle class precursors, was no longer as resuscitated and converted into social capital of the merchants and manufacturers confronting on the free market, being partly lost on the way. The precarious state of agricultural productivity was a poor source of expansion for the cooperative associations. The most visible expression of the absence of major stimulants for the development of the cooperative movement in agriculture was the presence of an explosive germ within the rural social structure where over 80% of the active population worked: the absolute majority (51.1%) of the auxiliary members of the families of agricultural workers and the relative majority consisting of the self-employed small agricultural workers (34.3%). The practice of subsistence agriculture within a family system with an active population overwhelmingly consisting of the family members that are helping the household head to perform a primate exploitation of the land drastically limited the opportunities to build and consolidate a vigorous cooperative movement. We discuss arguments presented by recognized experts concerning the identity of cooperatives as an institution of social economy: its finalities, relations between the normative state and the cooperative autonomy, types and frequencies of cooperative units, levels of participation of village and urban population to the cooperative movement. The article proposes a starting point for a debate concerning cooperation in relation to the dynamic of population needs, comparing cooperative politics versus real associative life, in the problematic context of social economy. We question the links between credit co operations, economic (production) co operations and the country level of economic development. We also bring into question the hopeless situation of the small agricultor on the market of agricultural products.

The study used purposive sampling and obtained data using structured questionnaires and personal interviews with the owners of the micro-enterprises. From the data, summary information was obtained and the impact of connection to grid-electricity on the micro-enterprises was examined using a log-linear regression model. The result shows that although not statistically significant, on average, enterprises in communities connected to the electricity grid are 16.2% more profitable than enterprises in communities not connected to the grid, and the use of generating sets in providing back-up electricity makes micro-enterprises more profitable. The study also observed that micro-enterprise owners are fully aware of the importance of electricity access to the profitability of their businesses and those who can afford to buy generating sets willingly do so. Incidentally, the total expenditure on generating sets by some enterprises is up to three times (3. ×) the tariff for grid-electricity in rural areas. The high cost of self-generated electricity increases the total cost of doing business in rural areas thus reducing the profit margin of the micro-enterprises. In conclusion, for rural electrification to be more effective in improving the living standard of rural dwellers, the larger problem of increasing the national generating capacity and the availability of grid-electricity should be tackled, and rural electrification programs should be carried out alongside other programs that reduce the barriers to establishing micro-enterprises like the creation of rural agricultural co-operatives to promote the productive use of electricity. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.",,10.1080/1389224X.2012.691784,Agribusiness; Cooperatives; Farmers; Market access; Organizations; Smallholders

They highlighted that smallholders' market access improves not only as a result of SMCs networking and negotiation with key actors in the public and private sectors, but also due to improved interrelationships among SMCs and other types of Farmers' Organizations (FOs). Peer-to-peer relationships with other SMCs are critical for mutual learning, collaboration and collective action.Practical implications: Peer-to-peer relationships among SMCs are crucial for them to overcome the internal and external social dilemmas SMCs are bound to face while improving smallholders' market access. This goes beyond the three kinds of relationships that scholars have pointed out thus far needed for effective FO development (relationships with members; the public sector and civil society; and with market players).

In materials that have significant localized and itinerant spins, it is not obvious which will induce order. We combine electrical transport, X-ray magnetic diffraction, and photoemission studies with band structure calculations to characterize successive antiferromagnetic transitions in GdSi. GdSi has both sizable local moments and a partially nested Fermi surface, without confounding contributions from orbital effects. We identify a route to incommensurate order where neither type of moment dominates, but is rooted in cooperative feedback between them. The nested Fermi surface of the itinerant electrons induces strong interactions between local moments at the nesting vector, whereas the ordered local moments in turn provide the necessary coupling for a spindensity wave to form among the itinerant electrons. This mechanism echoes the cooperative interactions between electrons and ions in charge-density-wave materials, and should be germane across a spectrum of transition-metal and rare-earth intermetallic compounds.",,10.1590/S0103-20032012000200006,Credit cooperatives; Institutional capital; Rural credit; Transaction cost

For that, a study case was promoted regarding the Rural Credit Cooperative of Sugarcane Suppliers and Cattle Farmers in the Piracicaba Region (Cocrefocapi). The main objective is to show the importance of Cocrefocapi to finance sugarcane suppliers from Piracicaba, analyzing the influence of some factors in the decision of sugarcane suppliers, in order to choose this cooperative as the main financing institution. Two econometric models of qualitativeresponse and a set of descriptive analysis were developed in this study. Results show that the land size is one factor which should be included when the demand for agricultural credit is analyzed. In addition, the econometric evidence shows that, bigger participation in the institutional capital of Cocrefocapi is not a factor which incentives members to borrow money in this Cooperative. On the other hand, although sugarcane suppliers who took loans in Cocrefocapi have chosen this institution because of lower transaction costs, results demonstrate that many of these people took loans in other institutions because they had other economic activities, which are not financed by Cocrefocapi.",,10.1111/j.1467-8292.2012.00472.x,Cooperatives; Governance; Hybrids; Transaction costs

Is it a form of vertical integration, an independent organization or an intermediate form of governance between the market and the hierarchy? This paper contributes to the economic theory of the cooperative organization by examining it from a comparative economic perspective. Departing from Williamson's one-dimensional continuum of governance structures, the paper adopts the view that governance structures exhibit multiple dimensions and true hybrids are market-like on some of these dimensions while hierarchy-like on others. I show that the cooperative blends market-like attributes with hierarchy-like mechanisms and thus should be viewed as a true hybrid rather than as an intermediate form.

Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.3844/ajabssp.2011.560.566,Active participation; Agricultural production cooperative; Farmer

First, despite the help and support by the government, the cooperative sector has not been able to play a major role in the development of the country and its share has not exceeded 3% of development program. The main aim of this study is identifying the factors affecting the participation of Shirvan-Chardavol townships agricultural cooperatives members.; Approach: This casual comparative applied research which uses survey method for data accumulation, is of Quasi-experimental research type because of impossibility of controlling the research variables. A researcher-made questionnair was used as the main tool for gathering data. The face and content validity of the questionnaire were confirmed by a group of university professors and cooperative experts; also the reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed through calculating the Kronbach alfa coefficient (a = 0.80).; Results: The statistical society of the research included 751 active members of Shirvan-Chardavol townships agricultural cooperatives, among which 260 people were selected for the study using classified proportional random sampling method and with the aid of Morgan sample-volume table. Data processing was performed using SPSS estatistial software, as well as descriptive estatistics (central and inferential indexes) and analytical estatistics (correlation coefficients and stepwise multiple regression analysis).; Conclusion: The correlation coefficient results show that there is significant relationship between the variables like age, background history of membership in cooperatives, the members agricultural land areas, annual income of the members, socio-cultural features, economical features, educational-extensional features, managerial factors, psychological features, political factors and communicational-informational factors from the one hand and the dependent variable of agricultural cooperatives members level of participation from the other.

Estimation of a determinant model of direct and indirect economic effects that assumed an endogenous relationship revealed that those cooperatives producing brand products that have a relatively long history of branding of products, systems for quality control, preservation of the local heritage, and a local partnership between agricultural and accommodation/restaurant sectors are much more likely to achieve the two primary economic goals of income and employment generation. It is concluded that a wider and longstanding perspective of local resource management is necessary to enhance the complementary relationship between economic gain of local brand farm products and tourism development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1002/mde.2589,

,the requirements of forestry cooperative organization development in china: a case study of different stakeholder groups,Wu J.; Han F.; Gao Y.; Wen Y.,Forestry Studies,14069954,59,,59-69,2013,Institute of Forestry and Rural Engineering,,"In the 1990s, an expansion of small-scale (farm) forestry in medium to low rainfall areas was considered to be an important part of increasing the national forest estate but it remains a very minor source of timber, largely confined to the higher rainfall areas. In most areas, returns from timber are much less than for alternative land uses, even with low discount rates. If however, there are additional returns from plantation grazing and carbon sequestration and there are other potential management gains, multiple use plantations may be more attractive. The goal of this study is to estimate the net present values of multiple use spotted gum plantations in a medium rainfall area of southeast Queensland. For the case study, production, carbon sequestration and emissions data were supplemented by formal and informal interviews with landholders, sawmill staff and government extension personnel. Forest inventory, biomass and soil sampling, and stakeholder interviews were used as sources of primary data. The costs and benefits data were converted into monetary terms and discounted to produce net present values. Evaluations in this study identify the optimal rotation age of plantations to be 33-34 years. This is the case if including carbon and stock values, and using either farm- or factory-gate timber prices. The net present value increases significantly however if farmers harvest the trees themselves. In addition, at harvesting age, it was found that carbon and stock had the potential to account for 19.2 and 11.4% respectively of the total returns from spotted gum plantations. Policy initiatives to support the farm forestry sub-sector should include pricing greenhouse gas emissions and developing and strengthening farmers co-operatives and marketing institutions to enhance farmers' bargaining power. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,10.2478/fsmu-2013-0011,Case Study; China; Forestry Cooperation Organization; Stakeholders

According to the results it can be seen that the real motivation for the development of cooperatives is farmers demands and the demands come from farmers pursuit of interests in forest industry. Cooperatives in China are still in the early stage of development, and the cooperative laws cannot cover all the basic features of the forestry and the cooperatives. Therefore, the relevant laws and guarantee systems for resource exploitation and management, publicity and demonstration, forestry technology training as well as the preferential policies such as tax breaks, are needed for the sound development of Chinas forestry cooperation organization. © 2013 Estonian University of Life Sciences.

We suggest that policy-makers should re-frame the governance apparatus associated with mutualism and social ownership in terms of the concept of meta-regulation.

This is particularly the case for 'producer owned' co-operatives that have small business operators such as farmers as their members. Although there has been some research into the strategic networking of co-operatives, there has been little attention given to the network behaviour and benefits to small firms as members of co-operatives, in particular to the benefits, risks and management issues associated with such networks. This research draws on case study data from Australian and French producer co-operatives to examine how small firms use co-operatives as a strategic network. It uses a conceptual framework for small firm alliances and networks originally developed by Street and Cameron (2007), and examines three research questions proposed in that study along with three interrelated theories (the resource based view, resource dependency and punctuated equilibrium). The study finds support for the conceptual framework and the theories as useful research tools. It also provides insights into the way small firms can use co-operatives to secure access to resources and mitigate environmental risk.

,new model rural cooperatives in gansu: a case study,Saunders M.; Bromwich D.,Journal of Enterprising Communities,17506204,6,4,325-338,2012,,,"Cotton, both a source of livelihood for millions of poor rural households and a major source of export revenues, is a vital commodity for the economic and social development of Mali. Inefficiencies in the Malian cotton system at the ginnery and producers' cooperative levels (e.g., late payment to farmers and poorly functioning credit schemes) have recently led to an important decline in supply, threatening the sustainability of the sector. Using regional data from 1998/1999 to 2008/2009, this study aims to quantitatively assess the contribution of key determinants, such as cotton prices and timely payment, toward the downward trend in cotton area. A dynamic supply model, based on adaptive expectations and partial adjustment, is employed to estimate the effects of prices and institutional factors, such as credit recovery rates and date of payment to farmers, on the Malian cotton supply. Results show that supply responds significantly to cotton prices relative to cereal and fertilizer prices. Date of payment varies across agricultural cycles and late payment negatively influences land devoted to cotton. Low credit repayment rates create disincentives to grow cotton. Therefore, the revitalization of the Malian cotton sector depends upon getting both prices and institutions right. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.",,10.1108/17506201211272760,Agricultural cooperatives; Agriculture; China; Community development; Rural development; Rural economies; Rural regions

Although some nonhuman animals are also capable of helping others altruistically, humans are considered unique in our voluntary helping and our variety of helping behaviors. Many still believe that this is because only humans can understand others' goals due to our unique ""theory of mind"" abilities, especially shared intentionality. However, we know little of the cognitive mechanisms underlying helping in nonhuman animals, especially if and how they understand others' goals. The present study provides the empirical evidence for flexible targeted helping depending on conspecifics' needs in chimpanzees. The subjects of this study selected an appropriate tool from a random set of seven objects to transfer to a conspecific partner confronted with differing tooluse situations, indicating that they understood what their partner needed. This targeted helping, (i.e., selecting the appropriate tool to transfer), was observed only when the helpers could visually assess their partner's situation. If visual access was obstructed, the chimpanzees still tried to help their partner upon request, but failed to select and donate the appropriate tool needed by their partner. These results suggest that the limitation in chimpanzees' voluntary helping is not necessarily due to failure in understanding others' goals. Chimpanzees can understand conspecifics' goals and demonstrate cognitively advanced targeted helping as long as they are able to visually evaluate their conspecifics' predicament. However, they will seldom help others without direct request for help.",,10.1111/apce.12012,Control; Cooperatives; Market failures; Ownership; Property rights constraints; Public policy

,problems of financing and agricultural credit: a case study of seyhan region,Akdemir S.,"Journal of Food, Agriculture and Environment",14590255,10,4-Mar,468-475,2012,WFL Publisher Ltd.,,"At the heart of one of the most densely populated mega-cities of India lies an eco-friendly and sustainable developmental business model. The city in question is Kolkata and the profitable but environmentally friendly venture that will be highlighted in this paper is that of wastewater-fed aquaculture practiced by a cooperative run by the local fishermen, namely Mudialy Fisherman's Cooperative Society (MFCS). Initially the marshy wetlands of Mudialy used to be flooded with polluted waste water from the city and the local industrial complex. Ultimately, the polluted water was released to the sacred River Ganges. This cooperative society has radically transformed these wetlands into an urban fishery and a water-front recreational ecosystem. The present paper focuses on the incredible task completed by the MFCS and also reports the results of water-quality analyses to ascertain that conditions in the water bodies of MFCS are ideal for a profitable aquaculture practice. All the water quality parameters studied (physicochemical water parameters, concentration of different heavy metals, and zooplankton community structure) were well within the normal limits from the point of view of pisciculture. This proves the efficiency of the wastewater purification system adopted by the cooperative society. The major advantage of wastewater-fed aquaculture over conventional wastewater treatment is the large diversity of marketable products and therefore broad possibilities of income generation. Thanks to the poor fishermen of MFCS, the water drained from these wetlands into the River Ganges is no longer polluted. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Agricultural credit; Credit policy; Farm; Turkish agriculture

The purpose of this research is to study the needs and opportunities for agricultural credit in the Adana region (675,000 ha including 223,000 irrigated). In the region farms have a very intensive production, with large input requirements and investments. In addition, prices and product yields fluctuate with weather conditions, market conditions, as well as farmers' choices to certain specialized production, which causes a large fluctuation in farm income. This offset can cause additional problems. On the other hand, traditional or modern family expenses, increase with urbanization. This phenomenon, coupled with a general increase in agricultural production costs, are causing a severe shortage of working capital to the farmer, who then sees the increase on its credit requirements. Normally, agricultural credit is mainly provided by the State agencies (Agricultural Bank, Agricultural Cooperatives). Indeed, this system is cheaper for farmers because the interest rates charged are well below the inflation rate but it requires guarantees, formality restrict the volume of loans actually granted, especially for small farmers. Thus, the latter to torment a parallel range of credit (loan shark, firms, non-agricultural banks, etc.) or the interest rate is generally very high and the formalities for obtaining less painful.",,10.1111/j.1467-8292.2012.00473.x,

Previous papers have highlighted such effects and explained it by the extra burden that diversified activities impose on the often limited management capacities of these organisations. We propose an alternative explanation, linking the scope of activities to membership structure: marketing cooperatives engaging in a vast array of unrelated activities may lose their marketing-oriented members for those more interested in the new activities proposed. The model's predictions are supported by recently collected data on 172 smallholder grain marketing cooperatives in Ethiopia.

Koperasi Unit Desa (KUDs) -in Indonesian, or Village Unit Cooperative (VUC) have been entrusted with the marketing of rice paddies although their performance has always been less than satisfactory. One problem experienced by the KUDs is not having sufficient cash to purchase and process paddies into rice. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a simulation model to represent cash flows during one paddy plantation season for a KUD (VUC). The simulation model is a decision support tool that enables a KUD's (VUC) management to determine the maximum quantity of paddies to be purchased; the minimum borrowing and additional borrowing; and the earnings before taxes. An investigator-administrated questionnaire was used to collect historical data of the twenty randomly selected KUDs (VUC) on Lombok Island to validate the sub-models of the simulation model. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit (two-sample), linear regression, correlation and t- tests were used to validate the simulation model. The validation results have shown that the sub-models of the simulation model are valid, and these may contribute to the valid results of the simulation model. This study has found that the limitations of the paddy storage building, drying floor, and milling machine owned by the KUDs (VUC) may restrict the KUDs (VUC) from buying the entire paddies harvested. Therefore, further research is needed to find out the minimum capacities of those facilities enabling the KUDs (VUC) to work efficiently.",,10.1108/jaoc.2013.31509baa.003,Cooperative business model; Cooperatives specificities; Corporate governance; Large farmers cooperatives

This paper provides contextual data and information for the development of PAMs specifically for the buffer zones of protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon, sites where REDD+ has the potential to generate considerable social and ecological co-benefits. The study sites are the buffer zones of two national parks, Yanachaga-Chemillen (YChNP) in central Peru and Manu (MNP) in the south-east. Data were collected through smallholder household surveys (n = 200), covering livelihood strategies, land use practices and preference rankings of five REDD+ criteria. The findings suggest that PAMs in buffer zones could realistically achieve an additional ~10 % conservation of remaining forest and between 25 and 70 % additional reforestation of non-forest areas on private lands. The paper argues that in areas where agricultural co-operatives exist, such as MNP, these should be engaged in national REDD+ PAMs and supported by an international NGO; in areas where smallholders operate individually, such as YChNP, international NGOs may be best placed to gain local trust and thereby raise participation rates. The environmental effectiveness of REDD+ conservation PAMs could be greater in areas of intense agricultural production, yet financial and technical support for reforestation may offer the most effective avenue for carbon mitigation in these areas. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,10.1177/0973005213499221,

For effective technology transfer, field demonstrations, method demonstrations, farmers' training camps, field days, and numerous field conventions were organized in addition to extending soil testing, literature supply, promotional seed and fertilizer input supply, and training of agro-cooperative society personnel who deal with seed and fertilizer input supply in the region. The greater extension gaps in tomato-blackgram and potato-Kharif onion crop sequences indicated need for effective technology transfer tools for high adoption of technology in these production systems in the valley. Potato-Kharif onion cropping system using INM technology resulted in greater system productivity in terms of blackgram equivalent yield (76.7q ha-1) and gross (3,06,920 ha-1) and net returns (2,22,295 ha-1), followed by tomato-blackgram and green pea-okra production systems, respectively, using an appropriate technology transfer model. The study also revealed improvement in available nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P)-potassium (K) and organic carbon (C) pool of the soils besides crop productivity and profitability in field trials under INM practices over farmers' practiced plots. Knowledge before the study about soil testing, dose and time of application of organics, chemical fertilizers, and their integrated use ranged from 9 to 41%, whereas knowledge increases after the study ranged between 55 to 88%. The INM technology adoption rate after 1 year of project completion ranged between 66 to 70%, whereas soil testing was done by only 35% of farmers. Thus, INM technology adoption rate was greater following the appropriate technology transfer model based on critical analyses of fertilizer use, existing production systems, and appropriate interventions for technology transfer. This comprehensive study under the IFFCO-KVK Collaborative Project attempts to highlight that an effective technology transfer model can play a key role in adoption of INM technology for sustainable production systems in the developing world, especially for resource- and knowledge-poor farmers of collateral socioagroeconomic environments of developing nations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1002/mde.2585,
,property rights problems in agricultural cooperatives: a heterodox institutionalist perspective,Valentinov V.; Iliopoulos C.,German Journal of Agricultural Economics,21914028,61,3,139-147,2012,,,"This paper investigates whether long-tenured cooperative chief executive officers (CEOs) are successful in negotiating less monitoring, resulting in the cooperative being agent driven. Utilizing a sample of the 1000 largest US agricultural cooperatives, we examine whether boards of long-tenured CEOs exhibit differences in composition, formal committees, or procedures that may indicate these boards are more lenient monitors. We find long-tenured CEOs experience less board monitoring. This result is primarily due to a difference in procedural mechanisms, rather than board composition. However, it is unclear whether monitoring leniency is an indication of the CEO's ability to negotiate less monitoring. It remains a possibility that CEOs with shorter tenures also influence the board; but their recommendations may be heavily influenced by non-compulsory conformance with stricter corporate governance regulations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Agricultural cooperatives; Ayres; Institutionalist dichotomy; Property rights; Veblen

This paper reconsiders these problems from the perspective of heterodox institutionalist economics in the tradition of Veblen and Ayres. The property rights problems of agricultural cooperatives seemingly reinforce the new institutional economics presumption of the superiority of fully delineated private ownership. In contrast, the paper shows these problems to be likewise consistent with the heterodox institutionalist school, which is much more reserved about the societal role of private ownership. Toward this end, the paper elaborates the logical structure of the so-called ""institutionalist dichotomy"".

Local (independent) traders still constitute a major market for coffee producers. Yet, cooperatives also accept the produce from non-members and pay them the same price. Our objective in this paper is to analyse the importance of this phenomenon of double side-selling. We collected data from a sample of 170 coffee farmers. We use a probit model to analyse characteristics linked to cooperative membership and to study double side-selling. We describe the trade relationships between farmers and the cooperative on the one hand, and between farmers and traders on the other by the attributes of transaction costs involved in the trade of coffee. Membership characteristics include easy access to labour, land tenure, risk aversion, and mutual trust between farmers and cooperatives' management. Preference to sell to traders can be explained by the trust farmers seem to have in them after the repeated transactions in credit and basic consumption items and by long-term relationships in the community. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1556/AEthn.58.2013.1.7,casual work; change of system; co-operative farm; establishment of industry; production on household plots; social stratification; unemployment

In Ibaragi Prefecture north of Tokyo, the agricultural cooperatives that provide inputs to farmers and market their vegetables and other produce helped their farmer-members introduce foreign trainees, who allowed farmers to expand their production and increased cooperative sales. Trainees must be paid the Japanese mini-mum wage for most of the 36 months they are in Japan with the additional costs for train-related system, but they are still cheaper than full-time Japanese farm workers.

Producer-owned marketing cooperatives can reduce the market power of private purchasers and restore competition. Non-members as well as members of the cooperatives will then receive higher prices. In the present paper I carry out a theoretical and an empirical investigation into the effect of Fairtrade and organically certified cooperatives on local competition and coffee prices in Chiapas, Mexico. A theoretical model is presented which explains how the competitive effect may work in this particular setting, where cooperative membership implies certain costs that are perceived differently by different producers. Also, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, I present evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis of a pro-competitive effect of cooperatives. © 2012 De Gruyter.

This article focuses on the rationale for an Australian-Canadian study on employees' involvement in social capital initiatives and the communication management of these initiatives. As employees are key stakeholders, they play a vital part in achieving organizational goals. This study, a work in progress, highlights an in-depth, qualitative analysis of two organizations-one in Canada and one in Australia-committed to funding community projects as part of their corporate social responsibility development and commitment. The importance of a qualitative study that focuses on subjective components of social capital is that it develops understanding of employees' attitudes, feelings, and viewpoints. It also begins to investigate why employees might/might not be committed, to organizations' social capital initiatives. Using an interpretative analysis lens, an understanding of the moral, relational, and communication dynamics is explored. Questions surrounding concepts such as the moral fiber of social capital are highlighted and critiqued in the context of community engagement and what organizations' social capital investments mean as part of their responsibility to society. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.5713/ajas.2011.10185,Breeding Scheme; Hanwoo; Integrated General Simulation Model; Simulation

We call this system the Integrated General Model (IGM) and it allows users to control the breeding schemes and selection methods by manipulating the input parameters. The Current Hanwoo Performance and Progeny Test (CHPPT) scheme was simulated with a Modified Hanwoo Performance and Progeny Test (MHPPT) scheme using a Hanwoo Breeding Farm cow population of the Livestock Improvement Main Center (LOMC) of the National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation (NACF). To compare the two schemes, a new method, the Simple Hanwoo Performance Test (SHPT), which uses ultrasound technology for measuring the carcass traits of live animals, was developed. These three models, including the CHPPT, incorporated three types of selection criteria: phenotype (PH), true breeding value (TBV), and estimated breeding value (EBV). The simulation was scheduled to mimic an actual Hanwoo breeding program; thus, the simulation was run to include the years 1983-2020 for each breeding method and was replicated 10 times. The parameters for simulation were derived from the literature. Approximately 642,000 animals were simulated per replication for the CHPPT scheme; 129,000 animals were simulated for the MHPPT scheme and 112,000 animals for the SHPT scheme. Throughout the 38-year simulation, all estimated parameters of each simulated population, regardless of population size, showed results similar to the input parameters. The deviations between input and output values for the parameters in the large populations were statistically acceptable. In this study, we integrated three simulated models, including the CHPPT, in an attempt to achieve the greatest genetic gains within major economic traits including body weight at 12 months of age (BW12), body weight at 24 months of age (BW24), average daily gain from 6 to 12 months (ADG), carcass weight (CWT), carcass longissimus muscle area (CLMA), carcass marbling score (CMS), ultrasound scanned longissimus muscle area (ULMA), and ultrasound scanned marbling score (UMS).",,10.1080/1389224X.2011.536356,Agri-environment scheme; Collective action; Farmer cooperatives; Landscape-scale management; Social learning

Using the theory of collective action as an analytical framework the paper examined findings from in-depth interviews with 20 members of two co-operative initiatives in Wales and two participatory workshops. Consideration of the theory helped in understanding how individuals come together to provide public goods, and the conditions that make this activity a success. Factors of importance for organising and delivering collective agrienvironment schemes were: locally adaptable engagement strategies; working with group members previously known to each other; institutional arrangements that limited group size and which allowed groups to develop their own solutions and implementation rules; and external support offering the services of a local facilitator and funding for both planning and management stages. A clear finding from the research was the extent to which both business and social confidence can grow within such groups which opens up further development opportunities. The paper identifies key factors that could be used to encourage and enhance the success of co-operative groups in delivering landscape-scale agri-environment schemes. The research findings identify appropriate mechanisms for the design and delivery of collective agri-environment schemes and environment management in the UK, which can also be applied to other parts of Europe. © 2011 Wageningen University.",,10.1108/20408021111162182,Co-operative organizations; Corporate social responsibility; Social responsibility

Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint identified by years of experience dealing with co-operative organisations. Findings: The paper finds that the basis of development of corporate social responsibility from the perspective of commercial corporations does not promote an adequate accounting framework for co-operative enterprises and member-owned businesses. Research limitations/implications: Practitioners in different areas of business are trying to make sense of sustainability accounting and reporting in a commercial setting. This piece by one of these, draws on a topical initiative around co-operative enterprises to raise questions around what is meant by performance in the context of member-owned enterprises and whether the field of corporate social responsibility has overlooked the relevance of ownership in terms of organisational incentives for action. Practical implications: The author proposes a series of definitions for co-operative performance, which are designed to underpin metrics that relate to ""member value"". This is offered in contrast to ""shareholder value"" for companies that, unlike co-operatives, are owned by external shareholders. Social implications: The field of corporate social responsibility is a major user and innovator of the tools and techniques for sustainability accounting and reporting. But it tends to be silent on ownership. However, if different models of ownership create different incentives for action on sustainable development, then rather than just accounting for ""how"" an enterprise operates, however it is owned and led, there may be value in tools to test ""whether"" an institution is fit for purpose in its fundamental design. Originality/value: The paper develops a new perspective and future research opportunities in identifying performance measures for co-operative enterprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,10.1038/nature09335,

Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply.

Despite the obvious democratic virtues of the participatory processes, there has been a recent increase in the critical literature, questioning their results. This paper intends to reveal the tension experienced by the contemporary social movements: the conflict between representativeness and innovation. Representa tive movements tend to consolidate and strengthen interests, and their institutionalization pushes them towards routine attitudes that often block their innovative potential. One way out of the impasses of the social movements is in the terms of management of the social participation focused explicitly on learning and innovation. Organizations coming from social movements are an essential part of the participatory processes. This article, based on the example of the Brazilian policy of strengthening family agriculture, examines two of those organizations whose origin is in the social movements: the Federação dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura Familiar - FETRAF (Federation of Workers in Family Farming), which is a trade union; and the CRESOL System of cooperatives for credit outreach. Both organizations stimulate participatory processes and are associated with government policies. In the case of the trade union, however, social participation does not result in innovation, and the ties with the government tend to restrict the movement to relations already known. As regards the credit cooperative, social participation and ties with the government are the result of incentives that encourage the strengthening of what the new economic sociology calls weak ties, and thus open the way to expand the very foundations of the processes of local development.",,,Co-operative; Horticulture; Marketing

,"orderly marketing: reality, rhetoric or myth?",Earl P.D.,Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,1755750X,3,3,329-350,2011,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,,"Credit unions are non-profit financial organisations that provide financial services to their members. They are located in 97 countries across the world. All credit unions are governed by a volunteer board and many are reliant on volunteers for all their labour requirements. However, recruiting volunteers is a problem. The literature on recruitment issues in volunteering in general, suggests that the not-for-profit sector looks to the private sector for guidance on recruitment policies and approaches. One such approach which is considered in this paper is market segmentation wherein the potential volunteer body is profiled to determine if an individual is likely to volunteer and if they are, to identify the type of role they are most likely to be attracted to. Prior literature on volunteering in non-profit organisations suggests that certain types of individual (dominant individuals) are more likely to volunteer. This paper investigates whether this dominant status profile is evident amongst volunteers in credit unions in Northern Ireland (NI). The study finds that people with dominant characteristics are more likely to be attracted to volunteering to the board of directors and individuals who have less dominant traits overall should be offered more social/participative type roles. This information can be used by credit union governing boards for volunteer recruitment, retention and management purposes. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,10.1108/17557501111157760,Agriculture; Canada; History; Marketing history; Orderly marketing; Wheat pools

Design/methodology/approach  The paper examines the critique that farm leaders and Wheat Pool officials levelled against the open market, and the way they posited orderly marketing as a solution to their perceived problems. Using contemporary data on wheat prices and movements, it analyzes the content of orderly marketing, and the results of its implementation by the Pools. Findings  The paper finds that orderly marketing was primarily a campaign slogan, that the problems it was alleged to address did not exist, and that its implementation by the Wheat Pools did not yield the results that the farm leaders had promised. The paper acknowledges however, the significant accomplishments of these organizations, and postulates that the concept of orderly marketing resonates with aspects of Canadian culture and helps to explain why grain marketing in the USA and Canada evolved so differently. Originality/value  The agricultural cooperative movement in Western Canada has been the subject of a great deal of historical research, most of it positive.

Data were obtained through: 1) questionnaires to a large group of cooperatives, 2) focus groups with a smaller number of cooperatives, and 3) personal interviews with union of cooperatives representatives. The findings indicate that the unions of cooperatives are working on issues such as registering and auditing cooperatives and resolving land ownership conflicts.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the peasant household credit investigation system in Hubei RCCs and provide some evidence and ideas to the formulation of relevant policies. Design/methodology/approach - First, this paper briefly reviews the related literature of the efficiency in credit investigation system; second, the paper gives a brief description of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and designs the indicators for efficiency evaluation; third, the paper accounts data sources and processing methods; and finally, the paper performs the empirical analysis and draws a conclusion. Findings - The paper finds that the efficiency of the resource allocation in both regions is unoptimistic, the general efficiency is somewhat low, and it shows the trend of declination. The efficiency of pure technology in two regions represents the adverse trend. Every year's average scale efficiency in both regions is higher than the pure technology efficiency. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper include the first use of DEA model to practically evaluate the efficiency of credit investigation system based on 54 samples of RCCs in Hubei Province and the horizontal and vertical comparisons of the results. The conclusions of this paper not only make the efficiency of credit investigation system in the province's 54 credit cooperatives comparable but also has a great application value to the actual decision-making departments in formulating credit policies, and each credit cooperative in further building the credit investigation system according to its own conditions. Moreover, it has certain reference value to other similar studies. Copyright © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this very harsh environment, agriculture is characterized by a great diversity of fruit varieties central to local food culture and household security. Local fruit trees can grow in poor soils on slopes and their resistance to diseases, cold, and ultraviolet light give them marked advantages over introduced varieties. However, the humanitarian crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union and recent efforts by development organizations to create markets by introducing exotic varieties are negatively affecting agricultural biodiversity (agrobiodiversity) and, potentially, household security. A study was carried out in 3 districts of the Gorno-Badakhshan province to investigate the household consumption and market potential of products derived from local varieties of apple, apricot, and mulberry and how these products could be better exploited to benefit community livelihoods and agrobiodiversity conservation. Results show that fruit represents the farmers' main source of food and income. Many local varieties are maintained for a variety of reasons related to household consumption, whereas the main reason for cultivating introduced varieties is income generation. Great care must therefore be taken in planning market strategies: a pure market focus will almost certainly endanger household security, whereas a strategy linking income generation through the commercialization of crop varieties to the promotion of qualities central to household needs will improve diversity and public health. The opportunities identified to help enhance the market potential of local fruits and maintain the Pamir's unique biocultural heritage include efforts to raise public awareness among producers and consumers of the nutritional and medicinal properties of local varieties; training for pest management, processing, and packaging; and the establishment of farmers' cooperatives. © 2011 International Mountain Society.",,,Agriculture; Antitrust regulation; Cooperatives; Market power

Altruistic reasons are found to be the most influential, with the act of volunteering also scoring highly. This knowledge should inform volunteer recruitment programmes and internal appraisal processes as management can reinforce messages that provide positive feedback to volunteers on the social benefits being achieved by the credit union. This will further motivate current volunteers, ensuring retention. When motivation was analyzed by volunteer characteristics we found that older volunteers, retired volunteers and volunteers who are less educated are more motivated in their role.

Despite the obvious democratic virtues of the participatory processes, there has been a recent increase in the critical literature, questioning their results. This paper intends to reveal the tension experienced by the contemporary social movements: the conflict between representativeness and innovation. Representative movements tend to consolidate and strengthen interests, and their institutionalization pushes them towards routine attitudes that often block their innovative potential. One way out of the impasses of the social movements is in the terms of management of the social participation focused explicitly on learning and innovation. Organizations coming from social movements are an essential part of the participatory processes. This article, based on the example of the Brazilian policy of strengthening family agriculture, examines two of those organizations whose origin is in the social movements: the Federação dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura Familiar - FETRAF (Federation of Workers in Family Farming), which is a trade union; and the CRESOL System of cooperatives for credit outreach. Both organizations stimulate participatory processes and are associated with government policies. In the case of the trade union, however, social participation does not result in innovation, and the ties with the government tend to restrict the movement to relations already known. As regards the credit cooperative, social participation and ties with the government are the result of incentives that encourage the strengthening of what the new economic sociology calls weak ties, and thus open the way to expand the very foundations of the processes of local development.",,10.11118/actaun201159020129,Crop rotation; Dynamic programming; Matlab algorithm; Production planning

For several years this number continued to rise, reaching a total of 250,000 members in more than 100 credit cooperative societies. Credit associations - part of the thriving cooperative movement of early Zionism - symbolized the attempt to create a new and just Jewish society by fusing socialist and capitalist ideals. From the mid-1950s, however, in a rapid process of centralization of Israel's capital market and financial institutions, almost all credit associations were absorbed into Israel's commercial banks and dissolved. Today, Israel's two largest banks (Leumi and Hapoalim) control over 63 percent of credit provision, and 90 percent of credit is provided to less than 1 percent of borrowers. The official policy of the Bank of Israel is to rule out the establishment of credit associations, credit unions or other non-bank financial institutions.

The management of the Agricultural Cooperative of Julio de Castilho (COTRIJUC) is analyzed and the procedures and management tools used by the cooperative, based on the model proposed by Oliveira (2006), are identified with the consequent understanding of the COOTRIJUC management system. Personal interviews and in-depth questionnaires with structured and unstructured questions were undertaken. Results show that the components of the model are known and valorized by the managers even though the cooperative does not have the expected performance in certain items.",,,Agricultural cooperatives; Multinomial logit; Principal competent analysis (PCA); Retail service quality scale (RSQS); Service quality (SERVQUAL)

The government benefited from the experience of other countries but replicated none. Instead it came up with an innovation: cooperative self-help under state control, seemingly a contradiction. The newly established People's Credit Funds (PCFs) are self-managed and self-financed; yet their success is due to the central bank designing the new system, preparing its regulatory framework, providing training and supervision and enforcing prudential standards, while abstaining from undue interference. Regulation and supervision have been the state's instruments for assuring good performance, avoiding the disaster of the previous credit cooperative sector. The network overall has proved resilient during the global crisis, but with some differences between the rural PCFs and their central fund, which in addition to liquidity exchange also provides retail services in urban areas. © Practical Action Publishing, 2010.",,10.1086/657907,

We present transformations in traditionally corporate arenas, such as mining and textile production, alongside parallel developments in transnational cooperatives, organic production systems, and ethnic deployments of the corporate form. We consider corporate influence in unexpected sectors, from conservation to poverty alleviation to cancer survival. Furthermore, we analyze corporate norms and practices in relation to broader governance trends, from fair-trade dynamics to shareholder activism and from corporate social responsibility initiatives to the spread of accountability measures and the impact of corporate sovereignty.

Emphasis is on localised food networks and connection between socially as well as environmentally sustainable production, distribution and consumption. Investigated is the premise that cooperative organisational structures, for reasons of their long-term socially responsible origins are at the forefront of development of local and sustainable food systems and are thereby in a position to offer a specific contribution to market development. Two key research questions are proposed: Firstly, is there a pre-determination of cooperatives to issues of sustainable and local food sourcing given the historical and practical context of their ethical/socially responsible and stakeholder-based business model? Secondly, do co-ops express support for re-localising food systems and what contribution do they make concerning sustainable food and their relationships with local food suppliers? The method of investigation is through a two country retailer co-operative sector analysis and comparison (Finland and Italy). The enquiry is qualitative and exploratory in nature in the form of an embedded, multiple case design. The paper makes practical and theoretical contribution to knowledge concerning interpretation of localness in food, the role of co-operatives and the co-operative ethos in sustainable food systems and the development of the local food economy. Results of the study show a positive relationship between co-operative ethos and (social) sustainability in local food, but the de-centralised nature of retailer co-operation also provides a barrier to replication of good practice. © 2011.

Results show that in all questions related to objectives and level of satisfaction, members value them with an average of 6.9 out of 10 or higher in all cases. For both objectives and satisfaction, the directors and the cooperative members who depend upon agricultural activity for a large percentage of their income have higher scores, compared with non-board members and members who are less dependent on agricultural activity (with a statistical significance of 1% and 5%, respectively). We also find that members who agree in more with the admission of new members, who think it is easy to recover their investments and who want to stay longer in the cooperative are those who are more willing to invest and to exert control. Furthermore, we find that members that prefer to have a participation in the assembly proportional to their contribution and that prefer that the cooperative diversifies more are those who are more willing to invest. In addition, control is favoured by members pertaining to the cooperative for a large period and for those members who think that investing in the cooperative is a high risk and who prefer long-term investments. Finally, directors are more willing to invest and to exert control.",,10.4149/ekol_2011_02_269,Changes; Eastern Slovakia; GIS; Land cover; Landscape heterogeneity

Model region comprises cadastral areas of Hlinné, Vyný ipov and Zlatník village. They are situated at the contact zone of two genetically distinct entities: Panónska panva basin and the Carpathians. It is a markedly heterogenous area, which has undergone considerable changes from the aspect of landscape heterogeneity development, particularly under the influence of collectivisation of agricultural production, industrialisation, development of communication networks and with that connected rise of built-up areas. The agriculture of the area and also landuse since 1826 has undergone considerable changes. There are agrarian terraces and ramparts, the oldest relics of the agricultural land use, which remained after farming on small fields, respectively plots. From an analysis of historical sources and results of field research can be concluded that the landscape preserved this character till early 50-ties of the 20 th century. The formation of agricultural cooperatives in the region and with this related intensification of agricultural production led to the disappearanc of agrarian terraces and ramparts on the one side by inclusion of them into forest communities in areas with higher slope. The agrarian terraces and ramparts have been preserved only in areas with the most exposed slope at the foothills of Slanské vrchy Mts in Zlatník and Vyný ipov in Beskydské predhorie hilly-land.

The Bangladesh Milk Producers' Cooperatives Union Ltd (or 'Milk Vita' as its brand name) is the only cooperative operating in all over the country. This study was conducted in the Baghabarighat Milk Shed Area (BMSA) situated in Sirajgonj and Pabna district under Milk Vita. Five sub-districts, namely Shahjadpur, Faridpur, Ullahpara, Sathia and Bera and 30 villages under those sub-districts were selected. The selection of different sub-districts were based on in order of the distance from the Milk Vita centre (Shahjadpur is the closest and Bera is the most far). Three hundred sample dairy farmers were selected randomly. The data were collected by using pre-tested and pre-designed structured questionnaire by face-to-face interview. The results showed that about 98% of the dairy cattle are cross bred (Pabna Milking Cows with Holstein Friesian, Shahiwal, and Jersey). It has also been observed that the highest number of both total and milk cattle are available in Shahjadpur. Concerning the management practices such as use of concentrates, water use, and use of artificial insemination are better-off in Shahjadpur. This is due to the fact that this area is situated very close to the Milk Vita Centre and accordingly has better access to the centre and has more knowledge about the management and also gets higher services which are beneficial to them. This study suggests to adopt a strategic planning by the Milk Vita management board to implement a harmonised and standard management and breeding programme for all the farmers independent of the distance from the centre.",,10.1111/j.1944-8287.2010.01102.x,Chain governance; Competitive relations; Cooperatives; Cut flowers; Global commodity chains; Global production networks (GPN); Global value chains (GVC); Regulation; The Netherlands

However, what is missing in Global Commodity Chain (GCC) and Global Value Chain (GVC) analyses is an explanation of how governance structures change over time. In this paper I suggest that the production system associated with particular commodities is not the only factor shaping commodity chain governance. Rather, I argue that actors' strategies, regulation, and historical trajectories also influence and, in certain conjunctures, transform chain governance. Since regulations and actor strategies in competitive environments change over time, it follows that chain governance is dynamic. Drawing from the case of the Dutch cut flower agro-industry, the world's leading supplier of cut flowers, I build on the GCC, GVC and Global Production Network (GPN) literatures to illustrate how actor strategies, regulation and the historical trajectory of the Dutch cut flower GCC shape and change chain governance. What the Dutch cut flower case illustrates is how grower strategies and government policy facilitated the formation of grower cooperatives, and transformed the power relations between growers and buyers in a shift from a buyer to a producer-driven chain. © 2010 Clark University.",,,Civil servants; Consumer co-operatives; Dietary diversity; Food security; Hunger riots; Importance index; Importance rating; Patient-capital; Poverty; Probit model; Sustainability

A large number of the urban populace has not been able to provide the food need of their family. Due to urban expansion, there is limited or no land for subsistence farming. The few that have the opportunity withdrew due to pilfering and competing time for office work, home and the farm. In order to deal with the crisis, civil servants formed cooperative societies which engaged in the bulk purchase of food items for the co-operators. The bill of food items purchased serves as loans which were deducted from their salaries. The study examines the effectiveness of cooperative societies in ensuring household food security and sustainability of civil servants in urban cities of Ondo state. A total of 180 civil servants were randomly selected and interviewed for the study. Findings show that majority 48.33% of the respondents patronize the consumer cooperative societies monthly to purchase the food need of the family, while 32.78% patronize the societies quarterly. The most important reason for patronizing being getting cheaper food prices than the market price and the ease of payment. Some at the end of the month, after all deductions made from their salaries, rarely have something to take home but believe in a Yoruba adage which says 'Tebi bati kuro ninu ise, ise buse ' literarily meaning that when hunger is out of poverty, then poverty is drastically reduced. Result of the probit model reveals a significant relationship between consumers' cooperatives and household food security, a positive significant relationship between educational status, income and food security. However, there is a negative relationship between family size and food security, indicating that the higher the family size, the greater the level of food insecurity.",,10.1007/s11367-011-0321-7,Agricultural production; Freshwater ecotoxicity; Life cycle assessment; Plant protection; Substitution active ingredient; USEtox; Wheat

The main objectives of this study are (1) to assess the environmental impact of winter wheat, using an LCA covering field practices, and the transport and storage of grain until it is sold to a miller; (2) to use the USEtox model (Rosenbaum, et al.. in Int J Life Cycle Assess 13:532-546, 2008) to assess the part of the total freshwater ecotoxicity impact due to pesticide use, its variability among plots, and to identify the active ingredients with the strongest impact; (3) and with the help of fungicide, insecticide, herbicide experts, to identify active ingredients to replace these high-impact pesticides and estimate the effect of such a substitution on total freshwater ecotoxicity. Materials and methods: InVivo (the authors' company) is a French union of agricultural cooperatives that produces and sells, amongst other products and services, decision-making tools to help farmers manage fertilization and pesticide applications. With the help of cooperatives and with the help of these tools, pedologic, climatologic and agronomic (in particular for fertilization and pesticide applications practices) data can be collected for each agricultural plot of a farm. Results and discussion: The main conclusions of this study are that : (1) when considering freshwater ecotoxicity impacts, pesticide use is predominant on the whole life cycle of winter wheat, (2) there is a huge scattering of the results observed between fields when compared to the low scattering of the results between the four production scenarios, (3) it is feasible, with the USEtox model, to identify the active ingredients with the strongest impact and to potentially decrease this average impact by 50% by substituting only three active ingredients. Conclusions: A further step to improve ecotoxicity assessment in LCA would be to develop a model to better estimate the pesticide emissions pattern on field, taking into account pedo-climatic conditions and farmers' practices. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,,Baories; Himachal Pradesh; Khatries; Resources; Traditional drinking water

Recent theoretical developments have sought to address the most obvious criticisms of the historical institutionalist approach, particularly the critique relating to its tendency to focus on explanations of stability. However, the institutional histories under consideration are generally incomplete as they do not include the entire life of the institution. Drawing on the history of collective wheat marketing in Australia, this article seeks to address this gap by considering a case in which strategies of institutional reproduction initially appeared to have managed change successfully but ultimately sowed the seeds of institutional demise. By considering the death as well as the life of an institution, we can gain a clearer picture of the effectiveness of institutional strategies of adaptation and change. © 2010 The Author.

In this study, insolvency was classified as the cooperative wich: failed to send statements to the Central Bank of Brazil, had negative equity or negative adjusted net worth, or even if it were classified in the following situations by the Central Bank of Brazil: paralyzed, in liquidation, canceled/closed and in ordinary liquidation. From a database of 9,456 observations collected from a sample of 112 cooperatives affiliated to Sicoob-Crediminas between January 1995 and May 2008, a set of Logit class models were estimated. The results obtained with the best fit allow us to infer that the financial ratios Allowance for Loan Losses/ Allowances Required for Overdue Loans, Non-Financial Investments/Total Assets, Non-Earning Assets/Total Assets, and Services Income/ Managerial Expenses were the most relevant in determining the likelihood of insolvency of cooperatives in our sample. These results support the hypothesis that the monitoring of financial accounting ratios of the Pearls system, which has not been the focus of the traditional analysis of balance sheets, is important for determining the probability of insolvency of credit unions, assisting their managers in identifying risk factors, as well as in creating a benchmark for comparing the performance of cooperatives, facilitating the supervision process by regulators. However, expansion of the estimated results for subsequent periods and other credit unions in Brazil must be done carefully, with alternative specifications to be evaluated in order to capture changes in the economic and administrative structure of the cooperatives, which may influence their accounting and financial indicators. © 2011 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

,"why do farmers prefer oil palm? lessons learnt from bungo district, indonesia",Feintrenie L.; Chong W.K.; Levang P.,Small-scale Forestry,18737854,9,3,379-396,2010,,,"Research into the benefits of mergers in small financial institutions, in particular credit unions, is sparse. This study helps to fill this gap by analyzing recent intense merger activity in New Zealand credit unions. The major driver for these mergers was not the usual reason of attempting to increase efficiency for competitive purposes but rather enforced government action. Data envelopment analysis is used to explore changes in efficiency in merged credit unions between 1996 and 2001. Those credit unions not involved in merger activity are used as a control group. Overall, credit unions have become more efficient over the period, notably in those that undertook mergers. The Malmquist index indicates significant technological progress over the period but a slight regression in terms of efficiency. © 2010 CIRIEC.",,10.1007/s11842-010-9122-2,Independent smallholders; Livelihoods impact; Nucleus Estates and Smallholders scheme; Rubber agroforest; Sumatra

Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy,19351682,11,1,-,2011,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,,"Indonesia has been the world's largest producer and exporter of palm oil since 2008. This paper discussed the livelihood impacts of oil palm development in Indonesia, based on lessons learnt from Bungo district, in the province of Jambi. The various community-company partnerships that structure the sector are reviewed and the difficulties raised by the joint ventures schemes are discussed. The merits and drawbacks of oil palm as a smallholder crop are then analysed, based on household socio-economic surveys conducted in 2007-2010. The main causes of conflicts between oil palm companies and communities are unclear land tenure, and a recurrent lack of leadership in smallholders' cooperatives. Under fair partnerships between smallholders and companies, oil palm could become a smallholder friendly crop. The land-use profitability analysis demonstrates the high returns that can be generated by oil palm independent smallholdings, making it highly competitive with rubber, and much more profitable than rice production. © 2010 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.",,10.2202/1935-1682.2694,efficiency; organisational innovations; property rights; vertical integration

This article analyzes the benefits and costs of Fairtrade coffee through an economic value chain approach. The study determines the economic income from Fairtrade coffee throughout the chain as well as exploring the benefits and consequences of Fairtrade for local producers in Nicaragua and Guatemala. Our analysis shows that consumer countries acquire the larger share of economic income, mainly because Fairtrade is positioned within the conventional market where large multinationals control the supply chain. The participation of large multinationals has led to increasing pressure and tough competition for the certified producer cooperatives in the Fairtrade market. On the consumer side, while consumer marketing narratives emphasize producer benefits of Fairtrade, our results demonstrate that its total benefits for primary producers is modest. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,,Bank debt; Cooperatives; Local banking competition

Besides, the analysis also considers the impact that bank market power and firm opaqueness exert on the amount of credit a firm can obtain. The empirical evidence leads to three main conclusions. Firstly, the financing of cooperative firms does not seem to be favored by credit cooperatives. By contrast, and this is the second finding, a synergetic relationship exists between commercial banks and cooperative firms, as it is from this typology of banks that cooperatives seem to receive more credit. Finally, cooperative firms are less likely to receive bank loans in less competitive local credit markets, even though this impact is decreasing for less opaque firms. © International Economic Society.",,,Accessibility; Farm decision; Involvement; Women

A sample of 44 households with commercial poultry farms were surveyed through structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, linear and logit regression models. The results revealed that men participated more on management activities such as vaccination, administration of drugs, debeaking and chicks procurement while women were more engaged in daily routine activities like cleaning of pens, provision of water, sorting of eggs etc. Furthermore women enjoyed about 53.6% level of involvement in farm decision making and only about 28.7% rate of accessibility to farm resources. Major determinants of the rate of accessibility of resources by women were flock size, years of experience, primary occupation, access to credit, cooperative participation and level of income. The determinants of decision making among women are age, years of experience, occupation, cooperative membership and income level. The study recommends that poultry production activities which have been identified to be of interest to women must be used as an avenue for empowering them. Input subsidies and credit facilities must be made available and easily accessible by the women. The women must be given maximum consideration with regards to extension service to inform, educate and train them on the use of recommended practices and technologies.

Thus, in contrast to the view of TPC as an objective governance mechanism, we argue that TPC is embedded in social, political and economic networks. This finding, we argue, raises questions as to how TPC is structured and operates, who gets to decide the ways it is structured and operates, and the ways that TPC might differentially impact on actors in the food and agricultural sector. © 2008 The Authors.

By presenting cases of the Tohoku region-one of the main paddy rice-producing regions in Japan-the spatial distribution of new rice varieties after the 1990s is recapitulated as follows: (1) at the regional level, distinct regional differentiation appeared with the emergence of main rice varieties in each prefecture; (2) at the prefecture level, planted areas of paddy rice decreased and the percentage of the main rice variety increased; and (3) throughout the regional and prefectural levels, the naming of new rice varieties was simplified and generalized. In the process of development and distribution of the new varieties of paddy rice, some conditions are considered as the commodification of the paddy rice-producing centers: (1) corresponding with recent market demands, new varieties with good flavor were constantly bred and spread; (2) values of some of the new varieties increased by being designated as ""regional brand-name varieties""; and (3) the primary new rice varieties were introduced simultaneously by individual farms according to marketing strategies developed by prefectural and municipal administrations and agricultural cooperatives. As for future proposals, the regional riceproducing centers will have to cooperate with small and medium-size enterprises that have the singular technology to produce new varieties.

In Petrolina and Juazeiro, the highest productivity rates are achieved in cultivating grapes and mangos, considered the principal fruits for the export market. The infrastructure in the irrigated perimeters includes the availability of water and electric power supply for both large and small producers alike. In Vale do Açu, the 1969 construction of the Armando Ribeiro Gonçalves Dam, with holding capacity of up to 2.7 billion liters of water, sought to enhance conditions for local residents by settling them on the land and making it possible for them to engage in agricultural production in the irrigated perimeter of the Lower Açu River. This region is the biggest producer of bananas in the entire country. In addition, for 8 years now, the Ceará-Mirim Valley has been the location of a farming cooperative called Agrovila Canudos, where 120 families are settled on an area measuring 1.3 thousand hectares.

Influence costs are higher in cooperatives than in investor-oriented firms due to the unique governance structure of the former. Hypotheses are formulated and tested regarding the relationship between influence costs and seven variables: membership size, member heterogeneity, average member age, singleness of purpose, managerial power over members, level of managerial compensation, and professional versus inside management. The main results are that heterogeneous member preferences, older average member age, and investment in multiple product lines all contribute to higher influence costs. At the same time, cooperatives with well-paid, powerful, and professional managers incur lower influence costs.

With some exceptions these failed to live up to expectations; having been created by governments they remained controlled by the interests of government, party and civil service. Then, under structural adjustment programmes they either collapsed or were reformed. Some new, more genuine co-operative sectors are now emerging. As they do, co-operatives face new challenges brought about by continuing processes of economic globalisation, the IT revolution, and changes in the national and international balance of powers. To survive and thrive, the ability for co-operative organisations to network effectively at both the local level and beyond is becoming increasingly important. This paper seeks to examine the relevance of the numerous theoretical perspectives on network formation and network management to the newly-emerging co-operative sectors in the developing world. Such networks are being built both within the co-operative sector itself (e.g. through federation) and with a range of other bodies, each locally, nationally and internationally.

Hence, I offer a reflexive ethnographic description of ""short-life"" co-op living based on a five year account of managing vacant properties that await refurbishment or re-development by two major Charitable Housing Trusts based in West London. In questioning how tenants deal with the constant threat of having to move, I ask how members of a short-life housing co-op create their own sense of self and stability through a temporary form of accommodation. My goal is thus to investigate how these co-op tenants appropriate space, relocate themselves and cope with transient domestic alienability. The creative formulation of individual and community identities are central to the wider understanding and implications of residential instability, alternative lifestyles and the general underlying ethos of co-operative organizations. © 2008 by the American Anthropological Association.

However, reality on the ground is entirely different and the situation remains unchanged. Since these measures have had hadly any impct on the financially excluded sections of society, the incidence of financial abandonment remains unchanged at the lowest administrative unit. Surprisingly, people at the grass root level are not familiar and have not even lieard about the financial inclusion measures. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect the necessary change to occur in the absence of any financial institution, like commercial bank or cooperative society at lowest administration unit level. Also, the conspicuous absence of rural credit cooperative societies and selfhelp group organizations has further worsened the situation in rural areas.

This study models effects of farm, farmer and technology specific factors on the decision of semi arid farmers to adopt cassava into their farming system. By way of threshold decision models-Probit and Logit models, the estimation of each country and the pooled data adoption models reveal different adoption models for the countries considered. For each country, different variables appeared as major adoption shifters. Comparatively, the adoption models for Nigeria and whole region appear to have the highest significance variables, being seven in number. This is followed by Chad (6), Ghana (4), and Burkina Faso and Niger with three each. For the variables considered, distance to nearby urban market appears a major adoption shifter in all the country, except for Niger. This is closely followed by contact with extension, variety, pest/disease resistance and livestock feeds, which appear significant in four of the countries.

The paper outlines the broader Weber and Habermas's model of rationality, and demonstrates its application. Design/methodology/approach  Drawing on verbatim quotes from a sampling of 35 in-depth interviews, the paper reveals the range of very different rationalities expressed in the social relations of work, of four very specific types of organisation: a bureaucracy, an entrepreneurial unit, a producer co-operative and a worker co-operative. Findings  The paper outlines two ideal sets of findings, ideal in the sense that in two of the organisations the rationalities, social relations of work and associated outcomes fit well with the Weber and Habermas model of instrumental strategic action and social strategic action. Research limitations/implications  This study shows the potential for broader rationality as it plays out in the workplace. The notion of workplaces that free workers to contribute in socially strategic ways points to new approaches to management and organisation. Practical implications  The paper offers practical insights into social relations built on co-operation, moral judgement and communication.

Findings - The study reveals that the rural co-operative has been able to improve the living standard of the rural people of the studied area, thus the rural co-operative accelerated the process of rural development in remote India. Research limitations/implications - The study, is totally based on the sample opinion and published data of the co-operative. The period of study is very short. So, the outcome of the study may not be generalized. Practical implications - A smooth and active system of loan-issuance and loan-recovery of a rural co-operative may uplift the living standard of the rural populace. Originality/value - This research could assist in the management of a co-operative since management-efficiency regarding the recovery of loan has been proved in this paper. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,

Yet, persistent market failures in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa have limited the impact of this strategy. As a result, there is increasing interest in the study of state and community failures - the underlying rural governance issues - that affect small-scale farmers. This paper contributes to this area of inquiry by examining the role of farmers' cooperatives in local governance systems in Ethiopia. By drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data sources, the paper offers new insights into the potential role of rural governance systems in national development strategies, the interactions between formal and informal rural governance systems, and possible avenues through which farmers' cooperatives can contribute to improving rural governance and national development.

The study was conducted in Kahramanmaras province of Turkey and comprised a stratified sample of 208 farmers from four districts of the province. The farmers rated each of the 21 selected sustainable agricultural practices for importance on a 5-point scale, and the total of these ratings formed the sustainable agriculture perception index. The index score was calculated for each farmer and was treated as the dependent variable in the stepwise regression analysis procedure. The independent variables were such socio-economic characteristics as the farming system, the total and irrigated area of the farm, membership of a cooperative society and participation in village administration, and age, education, and income of the farmer; components of information-seeking behavior included use of the mass media (newspapers, radio, and television), use of the Internet, travel, and participation in farming events. The results of the study showed that the higher the socio-economic status (more frequent contact with extension services, higher education, ownership of land, etc.) and the greater the access to information, the greater the perceived importance of sustainable agricultural practices. It is concluded that if policy-makers and extension organizations concentrate on these factors, they are more likely to succeed in making farmers more favorably disposed toward sustainable agriculture. © Springer Science + Business Media, B.V. 2008.",,,Acaricidal application; Control; Endemic stability; Tick-borne diseases

Agricultural cooperatives have long played an important role in helping their members manage risk.

Agricultural producers face various sorts of risk some of which are difficult to manage using standard institutions. The cooperative must deploy a different mechanism if it is to help members manage shocks to output. Inducing members to commit to deliver their entire production to the cooperative would require that shares in the cooperative be allocated in rough proportion to members' expected production. Agricultural cooperatives could perfectly share yield risk among their members by pooling total revenues from all their members and then distributing these revenues in proportion to members' shares.",,10.1057/fsm.2008.27,Credit unions; Customer satisfaction; Product / service strategy

Correct decision must cover the agriculture demands of planting the crops such as crop rotation restrictions or water resource scarcity, while the decision maker aims to plan the crop design in most profitable way in sense of maximizing the total profit from the crop yield. This decision problem represents the optimization of crop design and can be treated by the methods of linear programming which begun to be extensively used in agriculture production planning in USA during 50's. There is ongoing research of mathematical programming applications in agriculture worldwide, but the results are not easily transferable to other localities due to the specific local restrictions in each country. In Czech Republic the farmers use for production planning mainly their expert knowledge and past experience. However, the mathematical programming approach enables find the true optimal solution of the problem, which especially in the problems with a great number of constraints is not easy to find intuitively. One of the possible barriers for using the general decision support systems (which are based on mathematical programming methods) for agriculture production planning in Czech Republic is its expensiveness. The small farmer can not afford to buy the expensive software or to employ a mathematical programming specialist. The aim of this paper is to present a user friendly linear programming model of the typical agricultural production planning problem in Czech Republic which can be solved via software tools commonly available in any farm (e.g. EXCEL). The linear programming model covering the restrictions on total costs, crop rotation, thresholds for the total area sowed by particular crops, total amount of manure and the need of feed crops is developed. The model is applied in real-world problem of Czech agriculture cooperative and the results of its solution are compared to the real decision made.

,optimal cooperative pooling in a quality-differentiated market,Saitone T.L.; Sexton R.J.,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,14678276,91,5,1224-1232,2009,,,"Management of the assets and liabilities of credit unions is similar to other financial institutions because similar financial risks need to be balanced while meeting their first and foremost objective -- maximization of their shareholder's wealth. However, the risks are somewhat different because of the size, geographic concentration, liquidity needs and extension of credit only to its members. Geographic concentration limits the need for evaluation relative to the financial strengths and ability to assess and adequately monitor the risks of the investments. A small size credit union may manage risks by investing all of the surplus funds in a corporate credit union instead of investing in securities. However, the growth of credit union's assets and liabilities poses challenges for management in understanding risks and returns. Credit union management often uses a laddered portfolio as a tool to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. In this approach, investment maturities are laddered to provide necessary cash flows. This paper presents how fuzzy goal programming techniques can be efficiently applied in developing sophisticated investment decision making models to provide feasible solutions for credit union portfolio management problems for constructing efficient portfolios. We have formulated additive and weighted additive models for investment decisions using fuzzy goal programming. The results are tested based on scenario analysis for the data selected for the study. Additionally, comparison of the results from both models related to achievements of targeted goals and preferences is also presented. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",,10.1111/j.1467-8276.2009.01288.x,

Saitone and Richard J. Sexton focus on the role of marketing cooperatives in quality-differentiated markets through an economic model. They propose an economic modeling framework based on vertical product differentiation and utilize it to study cooperatives' pooling practices. They consider a market where farmers produce a vertically-differentiated commodity which can either be high-quality (H) or low-quality (L), where consumers always prefer H over L. Farmers are assumed initially to be homogeneous in their ability to produce H product. Tina and Richard then consider optimal cooperative pooling in a market where farmers can exit the cooperative in favor of a competitive marketing arrangement. All marketing firms operate with zero marginal cost. They demonstrate that traditional revenue pooling can confer two strategic advantages in a quality-differentiated market. Firstly pooling attenuates the incentive of competitive farmers to overproduce high-quality product and secondly, it insures risk-averse farmers against adverse realizations of quality.",,10.1080/09603100701262818,
,cross boundary farming: can this challenging farming method save the australian family farm?,Muenstermann I.,Rural Society,10371656,19,3,262-274,2009,,,"Nested analysis of variance is used to identify the sources of variation in performance, measured by growth of membership and growth of assets, for a large sample of US credit unions. The analysis reveals that sector effects (geographic, common bond and charter type) account for only relatively small proportions of the variation in performance. This raises doubts as to whether credit unions are likely to benefit much from competitive repositioning at sector level (by changing their charter type or common bond designation). It may be that the perceived benefit derived from such manoeuvrings is greater than the actual benefit, or it may be that the large number of credit unions seeking a more permissive operating environment has ended up negating any potential gain in performance across the sector as a whole. In contrast to the limited role identified for sector effects, individual credit union effects explain a large proportion of the variation in performance. This suggests that decisions made by individual credit unions with respect to staffing, governance and product portfolio, as well as philosophy and ethos, play an important role in explaining the heterogeneity in credit union performance.",,10.5172/rsj.19.3.262,Australian family farming; Co-operative and corporate farming; Collective management; Cross boundary farming; Individual ownership

Traditional family farming, co-operative and corporate farming, as well as cross-boundary farming is discussed. The latter is a form of collective farming: it means individual title, but collective ownership and management. These issues will be examined through a literature review and commentary. This system has worked well for many years in Europe (ABC Landline, 2001).

Two datasets were prepared for this study. To apply the test-day random regression model, 94,390 test-day records were prepared from 15,263 cows. The second data set consisted of 14,704 lactation records covering milk production over 305 days. Raw milk yield and composition data were collected from 1998 to 2002 by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation's dairy cattle improvement center by way of its milk testing program, which is nationally based. The pedigree information for this analysis was collected by the Korean Animal Improvement Association. The random regression models (RRMs) are single-trait animal models that consider each lactation record as an independent trait. Estimates of covariance were assumed to be different ones. In order to consider heterogeneity of residual variance in the analysis, test-days were classified into 29 classes. By considering heterogeneity of residual variance, variation for lactation performance in the early lactation classes was higher than during the middle classes and variance was lower in the late lactation classes than in the other two classes. This may be due to feeding management system and physiological properties of Holstein cows in Korea. Over classes e6 to e26 (covering 61 to 270 DIM), there was little change in residual variance, suggesting that a model with homogeneity of variance be used restricting the data to these days only. Estimates of heritability for milk yield ranged from 0.154 to 0.455, for which the estimates were variable depending on different lactation periods. Most of the heritabilities for milk yield using the RRM were higher than in the lactation model, and the estimate of genetic variance of milk yield was lower in the late lactation period than in the early or middle periods.",,10.1080/09538250903392101,

Offshore wind power, however, is not just technologically challenging but also a capital intensive and risky business that requires particular financial and organizational resources not all potential investors might have. We therefore address the question, what impact offshore wind power may have on ownership and organizational structures in the wind power sector. We compare on- and offshore wind park ownership in Denmark, the UK and Germany. The analysis shows that offshore wind power in all three countries is dominated by large firms, many of which are from the electricity sector. In Denmark and the UK, also investors from the gas and oil industry play an important role in the offshore wind business. This development represents a major shift for countries such as Germany and Denmark, in which the wind power sector has grown and matured on the basis of investments by individuals, farmers, cooperatives and independent project developers. The structural changes by which offshore wind power is accompanied have consequences for turbine manufacturers, project developers, investors, associations and policy makers in the field. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Others, however, have been able to maintain or even improve on previous levels of success. Individual farmers have also established new cooperatives and are working toward deepening cooperation. The paper discusses the importance of leadership of cooperatives during transition, a topic which is not well addressed in the literature. Production cooperatives are not only economic units, but also social networks. Two successful cooperatives in the same town, one old and one new, have been compared with respect to their social capital, development and leadership. The findings show that, in the traditional agricultural cooperative, a more social oriented leadership has helped to overcome economic, social, and psychological barriers arising during transition, while, in the case of the new co-op, improving cooperation has depended mainly on the increased level of social capital after the radical reforms.",,10.1080/15228910903187734,Credit unions; Financial performance; Ghana; Potential for future survival; Rural and community banks; Savings and loans companies

Cooperatives are a unique business structure that might not have profit maximization as a goal. Thus measures of performance other than return on equity are used to establish the link. Design/methodology/approach  The paper uses regression to explain the relationship between board characteristics and performance. Findings  The results of the models of return on assets and equity indicated that board size and compensation explain little of the variability in performance in these profitability measures. The results of the models of operating efficiencies explained a greater proportion of the variability in the operating efficiency and operating expenses-to-average assets ratios. In both models the relationship exhibited diminishing returns to board size and per member compensation. Research limitations/implications  The data are based on just one year of performance, limiting the generalizability of the results.

We nest a cross-sectional time-series panel model within the risk-adjusted earnings principles of Ohlson (1995), and apply the model to a dataset of NSW credit unions during a period of regulatory intervention that abruptly required management to meet minimum capital thresholds. Because they cannot issue equity, and other income increasing options conflicted with credit union philosophy, this provided a strong incentive to use MCE as an option to rapidly increase revenue (and capital). We find MCE was financially ineffective in small credit unions, had a positive marketing leverage impact in large credit unions, and required regular renewal. Our study makes several contributions by: (i) disaggregating and testing the financial impact of marketing; (ii) applying a risk-adjusted model generally applicable to non-listed firms; (iii) informing on the capitalisation/expensing debate; (iv) highlighting when and why MCE as a real option is financially (in)effective; and, (v) adding to the growing interface in the financial/marketing literature. © 2008, SAGE Publications.

We use individual credit union data on deposit categories and their associated interest rates to measure the effect of interest rate changes on the growth rates of total shares and five of its subcomponents. After controlling for credit union size, previous growth, and market interest rates, we find that while total share growth is related to individual credit union regular share and money market rates, it is most affected by share certificate rates. With the exception of share drafts, the growth in other deposit categories is significantly affected by the interest rate a credit union offers for those particular accounts. Finally, we provide evidence that, in general, the growth rate of a deposit category is negatively related to interest rates offered on other types of accounts. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,10.1057/jbr.2009.14,Credit crunch; Credit unions; Republic of Ireland and deposit protection schemes; United Kingdom; United States of America
,the incentive structure in public policies - the example of the law on producer groups in poland,Banaszak I.; Beckmann V.,Society and Economy,1588970X,30,1,79-92,2008,,,"Credit unions are financial co-operatives that conduct their business for their members. The principal purpose of a credit union is to receive deposits from and make loans to members. They do not serve the general public. Membership is restricted by a qualification that is referred to as a common bond or field of membership. The origins of credit unions are to be found at the heart of the Industrial Revolution, when Robert Owen established two famous co-operatives in Rochdale and New Lanark. The most prominent co-operative influenced by his ideas, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, opened their famous co-operative shop on Toad Lane in 1844. This was an important step in the social and political change that was taking place throughout Europe and of which the people of Rochdale can justifiably claim to be leaders. By 1848, the Co-operative had 140 members and the society's membership increased to 390, by 1880 the national membership of consumer societies had reached over 500 000, and by the turn of the century it had reached 1.5 million. The members of the two co-operatives subscribed to shares and paid small amounts to raise sufficient funds in order to purchase goods below the market value and then resell them to the members at a savings. These co-operatives were the result of the growing complexities of modern economic life for both farmers and workers. Importantly, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers developed a number of principles that have assisted the development of credit unions. These principles were open membership, the democratic control of the organisation, a limited interest on share capital and the return on member's interests being in proportion to the member's patronage. These principles illustrate why credit unions are a unique financial co-operative. Under the guidance of the World Council of Credit Unions, the growth of credit unions has been remarkable. In 2007, there were 49 000 credit unions and 177 000 000 members in 96 countries. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it aims to illustrate how credit unions are able to grow in times of economic hardship- a situation that is demonstrated by examining the impact of the Great Depression in the United States of America (USA) and the Credit Crunch in the United Kingdom (UK). Second, the article highlights the importance of deposit protection schemes when credit unions face financial difficulties in the USA, UK and the Republic of Ireland (Ireland). © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",,10.1556/SocEc.30.2008.1.4,Collective action; Poland; Producer groups; Public policy

Many groups, however, were disbanded within the first few years after the legislation came into effect. In many cases group members expected different forms of subsidies and less complicated application procedures. The provision of adequate information for farmers and the training of civil servants who would be able to assist them in interpreting the law could have increased the utilisation of support. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,10.1080/09593960701778119,coordination; dependence; empirical analysis; outcome- and behaviour control; performance; trust
,"the rural cooperative medical system in china: background, development, achievement and problems",Zhongyi J.; Xiurong H.,China Agricultural Economic Review,17561388,1,1,73-81,2009,,,"In dyadic channel partnerships, specific outcomes and behaviours are often emphasised to signal desirable objectives and actions that would lead to adequate levels of coordination. Much of the research regarding the outcome- and behaviour-based controls has adopted the perspective of the firm that manages the relationship (source). However, questions remain as to how, or even whether, the managed firm (target) benefits from these coordination efforts. Drawing on the most recent literature on channel governance, this research posits that both the target's trust in, and dependence on, the source moderate the effects of outcome- and behaviour-control on the target's performance. Formal hypotheses are tested on a sample of 157 agricultural cooperatives involved in channel partnership with larger, downstream second-order marketing cooperatives. The results indicate that the target's trust in the source enhances the positive effects of both types of controls. However, the target's dependence on the source decreases the positive effects of behaviour-based controls on the target's performance. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1108/17561370910915375,China; Co-operative organizations; Fundraising; Medical care; Medical insurance; Rural areas

The purpose of this paper is to outline the background, recent developments, achievements and problems of the RCMS and help people to understand the RCMS in China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a time approach, meaning the paper is organized by initiate background, system framework design, experiment and extension, achievement, problems and discussion about the RCMS development process. Findings - The Central Government intended to establish a new medical system in rural areas, so that farmers could protect themselves if they got sick. The paper finds that, with the help of the government, farmers have gradually accepted the medical cooperation system. The RCMS has rapidly been extended, and forms a basic medical security net for rural residents. The RCMS has achieved the initial goals of the policy reform: mitigating farmers' financial burden, increasing the number of visits to doctors, and reducing the cost of the RCMS. However, there are still some pending issues such as fund-raising, monitoring-efficiency, and medical targets that need to be solved.

Up to the nineteenth century they enjoyed a preeminent social position, but as industrialisation continued to grow their economic and social status declined, especially after the late nineteenth century crisis. Facing this situation, from the end of the nineteenth century they promoted important efforts for social mobilisation and tried to obtain control of the peasantry through agrarian cooperatives and other associations. Nevertheless, as a consequence of the increasing struggle with the peasantry, landowners changed their strategy, and in the 1930s concentrated their collective action on the defence of property.

Accordingly, the aim of this article is to illustrate an organisation mode that might ensure the efficient running of self-managed firms.

Community banks were created to: (1) promote rural development through provision of banking and financial services, (2) enhance rural productive activities, and (3) improve economic status of small-scale producers in rural and urban areas. According to Marx (2004), Nigeria has a dynamic informal financial sector. A key to growth strategy is to assist the development of this informal sector. The recent government policy to rid the economy of community banks defeats the original purpose underlying the creation of community banks. In view of the important role of community banks in Nigeria, the authors propose that community banks should continue to be rural financial institutions with specialized methods to serve broad segments of the rural population. The National Board for Community Banks should be vested with power to license, monitor and regulate community banks, and the regulatory power of the Central Bank of Nigeria over community banks should not go beyond that necessary for the performance of its monetary policy function. Furthermore, a partnership should be formed between the National Board for Community Banks, National Association of Community Banks and the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank for the purpose of funding rural ventures through loan syndication.

Carcass data of two hundred and eighty nine steers sired by 30 Korean proven sires were collected from two regions; the Hanwoo Improvement Center of National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in Seosan, Chungnam province and the commercial farms in Gyeongbuk province. The steers in Seosan were born between spring and fall of 2006 and those in Gyeonbuk between falls of 2004 and 2005. The former steers were slaughtered at approximately 24 months, while the latter steers were fed six months longer before slaughter. Among the 55,074 SNPs in the Illumina bovine 50K chip, a total of 32,756 available SNPs were selected for whole genome association study. After adjusting for the effects of sire, region and slaughter age, phenotypes were regressed on each SNP using a simple linear regression model. For the significance threshold, 0.1% point-wise p value from F distribution was used for each SNP test. Among the significant SNPs for a trait, the best set of SNP markers were selected using a stepwise regression procedure, and inclusion and exclusion of each SNP out of the model was determined at the p<0.001 level. A total of 118 SNPs were detected; 15, 20, 22, 28, 20, and 13 SNPs for final weight before slaughter, carcass weight, backfat thickness, weight index, longissimus dorsi muscle area, and marbling score, respectively. Among the significant SNPs, the best set of 44 SNPs was determined by stepwise regression procedures with 7, 9, 6, 9, 7, and 6 SNPs for the respective traits. Each set of SNPs per trait explained 20-40% of phenotypic variance. The number of detected SNPs per trait was not great in whole genome association tests, suggesting additional phenotype and genotype data are required to get more power to detect the trait-related SNPs with high accuracy for estimation of the SNP effect. These SNP markers could be applied to commercial Hanwoo populations via marker-assisted selection to verify the SNP effects and to improve genetic potentials in successive generations of the Hanwoo populations.",,10.1016/j.resconrec.2008.09.004,Capacity enhancement; Local government authorities; Performance indicators; Solid waste recycling; Statistical analysis

The effective way to reduce this tremendous issue is to integreate waste recycling systems into existing and future SWM. Understanding factors influencing recycling performance is the key to achieving sustainable waste management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the performance of SWM relating to solid waste recycling covering a total of 120 solid waste recycling programs located in different urban areas of Thailand. The indicators involving efficiency, effectiveness and service ratio were used for the assessment of recycling performance using statistical analysis methods. Influencing factors encompassing technical, economic and financial, and institutional aspects were identified for three types of recycling programs (school garbage bank, community garbage bank, and composting facility). The results suggest that common significant factors are perception of administrator awareness of SWM problems, and source separation. In terms of school garbage banks, the provision of monetary incentive including interest and compensatory goods for recycling members, transportation cost, and low investment costs significantly affect the performance. Provision of loans, managing the program as a cooperative organization, and provision of door-to-door service correlate with better performance by community garbage banks. For composting facilities, provision of free organic waste bins and cooperation with NGOs correlate with a higher rate of waste diversion. The findings also propose implications for enhancing the performance of recycling systems through a number of measures including provision of monetary incentive, tax incentives, subsidizations, information dissemination, awareness campaigns, training, technical assistance, staff exchanges, and networking with voluntary organizations-which should be formulated with respect to building capacity of development partners, responding to poor recycling performance, and focusing on significant influencing factors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In cooperative societies with high reproductive skew, selection on females is likely to operate principally through variation in the probability of acquiring dominant status and variation in reproductive success while dominant. Despite this, few studies of cooperative societies have investigated the factors that influence which females become dominant, and/or their reproductive output while in the dominant position. 2. Here we use long-term data from a wild meerkat population to describe variation in the breeding success of dominant female meerkats Suricata suricatta and investigate its causes. 3. Female meerkats compete intensely for breeding positions, and the probability of acquiring the breeding role depends upon a female's age in relation to competitors and her weight, both at the time of dominance acquisition and early in life. 4. Once dominant, individual differences in breeding success depend principally on the duration of dominance tenure. Females remain for longer in the dominant position if they are heavier than their competitors at the start of dominance, and if the number of adult female competitors at the start is low. 5. Female breeding success is also affected by variation in fecundity and pup survival, both of which increase with group size. After controlling for these effects, female body weight has a positive influence on breeding rate and litter size, while the number of adult female competitors reduces litter survival. 6. These findings suggest that selection for body weight and competitive ability will be high in female meerkats, which may moderate their investment in cooperative activities. We suggest that similar consequences of competition may occur among females in other cooperative societies where the benefits of attaining dominance status are high. © 2007 The Authors.",,10.1590/S1807-76922009000300003,Agricultural cooperatives; Diversification strategy; Internationalization strategy

Of the 28 cooperatives to be included in the study, 67.9% returned valid structured questionnaires. The collected data was submitted to non-parametric statistical analysis. Key findings suggest the following: external markets are served by indirect and direct exports; product diversification strategies are motivated by the creation of revenue alternatives to members and by the reduction of risks associated to agricultural business; diversification strategies are conceived to develop new business in accordance with market demand and to expand customized products from the existing portfolio; the formation of strategic alliances prioritizes access to distribution channels abroad; internationalization and diversification strategies produce positive results both from an economic and a social perspective. © 2009 Brazilian Administration Review.",,,

,"credit union regulation and the financial services authority: less is more, but better!",Baker A.,International Journal of Law and Management,1754243X,50,6,301-315,2008,,,"Approaches to manage for the sustainable use of natural and cultural resources in a landscape can have many different designs. One design is adaptive collaborative landscape management (ACLM) where research providers and users work closely together on projects to develop resources while adaptively managing to sustain or maintain landscapes in the long term. We propose that collaborative projects are more useful for achieving outcomes than integrative projects where participants merely join their separate contributions. To foster collaborative research projects to adaptively manage landscapes in northern Australia, a Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre (TSCRC) was established in 1995. The TSCRC is a joint venture of major organizations involved in research and land management. This paper is our perspective on the four most important 'lessons learned' after using a ACLM-type approach for over 10 y. We learnt that collaboration (working in combination) not necessarily integration (combining parts into a whole) achieved sustainable outcomes. We found that integration across culturally diverse perspectives seldom achieved sustainable solutions because it devalued the position of the less empowered participants. In addition, positive outcomes were achieved when participants developed trust and respect for each other by embracing and respecting their differences and by sharing unifying concepts such as savanna health. Another lesson learned was that a collaborative organization must act as an honest broker by resisting advocacy of one view point over another. Finally, we recognized the importance of strongly investing in communication and networking so that people could adaptively learn from one another's experiences, understand each other's challenges and respect each other's choices. Our experience confirms the usefulness of the ACLM approach and highlights its role in the process of sustaining healthy landscapes. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",,10.1108/17542430810919259,Credit unions; Regulation; United Kingdom

,reaching the rural poor through rural producer organizations? a study of agricultural marketing cooperatives in ethiopia,Bernard T.; Spielman D.J.,Food Policy,3069192,34,1,60-69,2009,,,"1. Subordinate helpers in cooperative societies may gain both immediate and future benefits, including paternity and territorial inheritance. However, if such opportunities correlate with rank in the queue, it is unclear why such queues should be stable. 2. In cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus, only males are generally philopatric, and form stable hierarchical queues for the dominant position. 3. Male opportunities for reproduction are influenced both by their dominance status within the group, and their relatedness to the breeding female. For young queuing subordinates, the breeding female is typically their mother. Because of incest avoidance, reproduction is possible only through extra-group mating, even if the dominant position is achieved while the mother is still on the territory. If the mother dies while the helper is still a subordinate, he can seek matings both outside the group, and with the unrelated replacement female within the group. Finally, males can achieve the dominant position and pair with an unrelated female by inheritance, dispersal to a neighbouring vacancy, or by forming a liaison with an immigrant subordinate female that causes fission of the natal territory. 4. On average males spent more time living with unrelated females than with their mother. Subordinate males gained no survival advantages when living with their mother rather than an unrelated female, contrary to the prediction that parents facilitate the survival of their offspring. 5. Dominants and subordinates also had similar survival. Mortality accelerated over time, probably because older males invest more in extra-group courtship display. 6. Fairy-wren queues are likely to be stable because older birds are superior, and because extra-pair mating provides direct benefits to subordinates. © 2007 The Author.",,10.1016/j.foodpol.2008.08.001,Agricultural cooperatives; Ethiopia; Farmer organizations; Smallholder commercialization

We tested experimentally whether dispersal options influence dispersal propensity in the cooperatively breeding Lake Tanganyika cichlids Neolamprologus pulcher and N. savoryi. Cooperative groups of these fishes breed in densely packed colonies, surrounded by unoccupied, but apparently suitable breeding habitat. Breeding inside colonies and living in groups seems to benefit individuals, for example by early detection and deterrence of predators. We show that despite a slight preference of both species for habitat with a higher stone cover, 40% of the preferred habitat remained unoccupied. On average, the colonies contained a higher number of (1) predators of adults, juveniles and eggs, (2) shelter competitors, and (3) other species including potential food competitors, compared to the outside colony habitat. Apparently, habitat differences cannot explain why these cichlids breed in colonies. Accordingly, dispersal may not be limited by a lack of suitable breeding shelters, but by the relatively higher risk of establishing an outside- compared to a within-colony breeding territory. To test whether cichlids prefer within- to outside-colony breeding territories, we provided breeding shelters inside the colony and at the colony edge and studied helper dispersal. As expected, significantly more shelters were occupied within the colony compared to the edge. New breeding pairs with several helpers occupied these shelters. We conclude that although breeding habitat is plentiful outside the colonies, helpers delay dispersal to obtain a higher quality breeding position within the group or colony eventually, or they disperse in groups. Our results suggest that (1) group augmentation and Allee effects are generally important for dispersal decisions in cooperatively breeding cichlids, consistent with the 'benefits of philopatry hypothesis', and (2) habitat saturation cannot fully explain delayed dispersal in these species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,Corporate governance; Credit union; Expertise; Financial literacy; Independence; Supervisory committee; Trinidad and Tobago

The author's conclusions are based upon an analysis of the amendments to the Credit Unions Act 1979 introduced by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). As a result, the 1979 Act now reciprocates the controversial, yet flexible United States (US) legislative framework. In particular, the article examines the interpretation of the common bond, the provision of financial services and the regulation of credit unions. The article concludes that these three statutory provisions have assisted the growth of credit unions in both countries and not limited their development. However, the growth of credit unions has come, at the expense of their unique status and philosophy. It has made US credit unions, in particular, indistinguishable from banks. This is a problem which may affect credit unions in the UK.

,controlling the risk for an agricultural harvest,Allen S.J.; Schuster E.W.,Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,15265498,6,3,225-236,2004,,,"Among all sectors in the Philippine agricultural economy, livestock exhibited the fastest and most consistent growth (4.6 percent on average per year) in the 1990s and well into the twenty-first century, steadily increasing its share of contribution to gross value added in agriculture from 18 percent in 1990 to 24 percent by 2003. The expansion of the industry has been propelled mainly by growth in domestic demand for meat in general, and for pork in particular, fueled by a still-rapid population growth, increased urbanization, and modest improvements in per capita income, particularly in the national capital and in major urban centers in the provinces around the Metropolitan Manila area. Pig production is the largest contributor to meat output in the Philippines. It is also an economic activity in which smallholders still dominate, accounting for close to 80 percent of total pig inventories. The strong growth in demand for pork presents a potential for increasing income opportunities, and therefore for poverty alleviation among rural and agricultural households in the Philippines, where rural poverty incidence for families remains high at 40.3 percent. In the two major hog-producing regions of Southern and Central Luzon adjacent to the national capital, however, the observed trends depict a more rapid decline in the share of smallholder pig producers in regional output, such that by 2003, smallholders held the minority share. In these two regions, although the number of registered commercial pig farms significantly increased, the number of farms raising pigs declined between the 1990s and 2000s. These numbers suggest a scaling up of larger farms and a displacement of smaller ones. The more rapid growth in larger commercial farms is not solely premised on the existence of economies of scale in production but is attributed, in large part, to the commercial sector being able to escape or at least overcome transaction costs that cannot be handled as easily by small producers. In addition, the cost advantage of large farms over small ones is also hypothesized to stem from their ability to access privileged prices of crucial inputs that are linked to policy subsidies. On the demand side of the meat industry, consuming households in the metropolis and in the major urbanizing centers in the two regions, with their higher incomes and purchasing power, are not only increasing their consumption of meat but also their demand for quality, convenience, and greater product differentiation. On the supply side, large meat products companies are vertically integrating pig-production operations; exercising control over their own breeding farms, feed formulation, and animal health services; and establishing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point-compatible slaughtering and processing plants. They are also producing differentiated meat cuts and meat products, packaging them in convenient forms, and establishing their own brands. In the regulatory scene, the government's National Meat Inspection Service is strengthening monitoring, inspection, and grading functions on the sanitary conditions of all slaughterhouses, public and private, for local, national, and international trade in meat. These changing market forces, compounded by structural factors and the policy environment, pose a serious challenge to the continued survival of smallholder pig producers. The poverty implications of the displacement of smallholders in the market raise important social questions. This report attempts to respond to these questions by investigating empirical evidence about the scale and access issues that affect smallholders. The study employs two methods to quantify the contributions of market forces and policies affecting the scale of livestock-production operations. Then it relates each contribution to measures that can be taken to overcome transaction cost barriers and policy distortions faced by smallholders that tend to ease them out of mainstream markets for their output and consign them to marginal ones. Chapter 1 provides the background of the study, states the objectives, and lays down the scale issues related to competitiveness in markets for livestock that are to be investigated. The chapter breaks down the objectives into three main questions on: (1) whether small pig-producing farms can compete with large farms; (2) the role of transaction cost barriers in smallholder participation and performance in hog production; and (3) redressing transaction cost barriers if these barriers affect small and large farms differentially. Chapter 2 lays out the two approaches that the study uses in investigating the role of transaction costs in economic activities. The first is a direct approach through a market participation model. The second is an indirect approach through the estimation of an efficiency model. A brief review of the literature on these approaches is provided. The market participation model assesses the roles of household characteristics and factors outside the household in determining participation in pig production and the level of market participation. The profit-efficiency model assesses farm-level differences in efficiency in generating profits from a given level of resources, input and output prices in terms of differences in transaction costs, and policy subsidies across the scale of operations studied (from small, backyard-level to medium-scale farms). Chapter 3 focuses on the determinants of participation by households in the economic activity of pig production. It begins by providing a brief description of the Southern Tagalog region and the subregion consisting of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon provinces (CALABARZON), where the study was undertaken. The investigation draws on field data collected in 2000-2001 from three cities in the two major pig-producing provinces in the region. Household-level data were obtained from a sample of 144 pig-producing households and 141 households not producing livestock, randomly picked from identified pig-producing villages. A probit market-participation model was estimated and results were analyzed to explain why some households engage in pig production whereas others do not. Among the significant factors that influenced the decision of households to participate in pig production were the availability of household resources, particularly family labor, and the opportunity costs of the household head and spouse in engaging in pig production, a labor-intensive economic activity. Households with more members of working age tended to participate, whereas those with household heads or spouses that were government or private sector employees tended not to be engaged in pig production. The decision to participate was also influenced by the capacity of the households to deal with fixed transaction costs related to access to financial resources for engaging in the activity and to negotiations involved in a market-oriented activity. The results of the Heckman two-step selection model reveal that the price of slaughter hogs and the access to market outlets that are not limited to the confines of the village are significant factors that influenced the household's level of participation in pig production. Chapter 4 focuses on the pig-producing households, further disaggregated into independent and contract producers. The chapter compares independent and contract farms in terms of the types of production activities engaged in and access to information and credit, feeds and growing or breeding stock, animal health services, and markets for inputs and outputs. Most contract growers tended to specialize in fattening pigs to slaughter hogs. In contrast, independent producers tended to combine the production of weaners (piglets) with slaughter hogs or specialized in weaner piglet production. Both independent and contract producers were highly market oriented, although in varying intensities, from purchasing mixed feeds and growing or breeding stock, to selling output to various outlets. Smallholders were grouped into size quintiles according to the level of their annualized outputs. The levels of activity covered a wide range. Those belonging to the lowest quintile produced very small volumes of output (averaging 315 kilograms per year). Mean output was equivalent to approximately five slaughter hogs per year, or about 20 piglets per year, in one or two batches. Producers in the third quintile produced about six times as much as the first, whereas those in the last quintile produced about 200 slaughter hogs per year, 40 times more than the average production per farm of the first quintile. In general, contract growers in the sample operated at significantly higher levels of activity than did independents, with the majority of them falling in the fourth and fifth size quintiles. Even so, they are still rightfully classified as smallholder producers engaged in a nonformal enterprise, having very similar household characteristics to the independent smallholder sample except for the number of animals kept. The two groups mainly use unpaid household labor (rarely employing hired labor) and have similar nonlivestock sector resources. Contract growers exhibited better access to quality feeds and stock, feed credit, veterinary health services, and credit for expansion purposes. Contract growers also had better access to markets for slaughter hogs, even if their location relative to that of independent producers was at a greater distance from Metropolitan Manila, the main market for live hogs. The advantage of contract growers in the market relative to independents can be traced to the former's integration into a formal institution - a feedmilling and multipurpose cooperative - for the production and marketing of their output.",,10.1287/msom.1040.0035,Agriculture; Harvest risk

Utilizing the logic of the property rights theory of the firm, the paper develops an alternative continuum for cooperative, hierarchical, and market organization. These governance mechanisms are shown to exhibit growing difference in the extensiveness of property rights assigned to the involved contractual parties. This continuum does not imply the hybridity of cooperatives; rather, it locates hierarchy between market and cooperative organization.

,why do agricultural credit cooperatives merge? the portuguese experience,Cabo P.; Rebelo J.,Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics,14678292,76,3,491-516,2005,,,"This paper builds upon recent advances in the corporate governance framework to extend and complement the economic literature on producer cooperatives. We argue that the problem of governance in a cooperative is twofold and consists in designing mechanisms and setting up institutions that (1) encourage workers to define a goal that maximizes workers welfare and (2) induce managers to pursue and internalize such a broad goal. When compared to capital-controlled firms, the agency problems become more complex and harder to solve in the cooperative framework. As empirical evidence of this problem and its corresponding solution, we illustrate the case of the Mondragón cooperatives, explaining in detail the incentive system and the control mechanisms now in place in this successful business group. The study of the governance architecture of Mondragón may help us to propose solutions to traditional problems of the cooperative firm and to reach a better understanding of both the governance of cooperatives and corporate governance in general. © 2006 M.E.

This paper describes the economic reasons that have led the ACCs to merge, and analyses the ex post merger impact on their economic performance. The results show that: (a) incorporating ACCs are larger, more profitable and hold a better credit management; (b) incorporated ACCs are smaller, face difficulties in reaching a minimum efficient scale and have weaker credit management as well as leverage problems; and (c) merged ACCs have a heavy administrative cost structure and also face profitability problems. Regarding the mergers' ex post impact on the ACCs performance, we find no positive influence on cost reduction, credit management and solvency ratio. © CIRIEC 2005.",,,

As agriculture in this region has become increasingly intensive and specialized, land managers have tended to ignore the role of the landscape in providing goods and services such as water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. However, many farmers and ranchers claim that they would welcome an opportunity to protect ecosystem health while general consumer behaviour has indicated that they are willing to pay a premium to encourage such efforts. This article has two main objectives. First, it provides an overview of the main institutional approaches that have been developed to encourage natural ecosystem conservation and environmental and economic sustainability in the prairie landscape. Second, the discussion then centres on the role and potential of an alternative institutional approach, namely, a strategic consumer-producer cooperative. In this discussion we highlight the appropriateness, advantages, and disadvantages of consumer-producer cooperatives in altering agricultural management to enhance the ecological, economic, and social sustainability of the prairie landscape.

The NGC structure, based on tradable shares that are linked to the right and obligation to deliver specific quantities of raw product to the processing facility, helps overcome the free rider, horizon, portfolio, and control problems that have plagued traditional cooperatives. Over the past several years, however, concerns have begun to emerge about the longrun viability of this cooperative form, as several large NGCs have been taken over by or converted to investor-owned firms (IOFs). This article describes how the NGC's choice of stock trading rules and procedures affects NGC formation and takeover. We consider a perfectly competitive market for NGC stock as well as discriminatory auction and competitive auction stock trading mechanisms. Drawing on results from a dynamic, heterogeneous agent model of the market for NGC stock developed by Holland, we analyze how each of these stock trading mechanisms affects the reversibility of an investment in an NGC and, consequently, the conditions under which the NGC will form or be sold to an IOF.

During the inter-war period wholesalers, 'middlemen' as they were commonly called, occupied the position of bogeyman in much Labour party thinking and literature. As a result the Labour governments of the 1920s took actions designed to achieve two ends: to improve the efficiency of food distribution, and to limit the power of middlemen to exploit both ends of the food production chain, farmers and consumers alike. This ideological positioning of the middleman by Labour, and the reforms introduced under the MacDonald governments, stressed the need to establish farmers' co-operatives and consumers' protection agencies, and also emphasized the importance of other measures designed to boost efficiency. However, by the time of the Attlee governments the cornerstone of the inter-war policy, the producer co-operative, had been abandoned and the focus of debate shifted to various forms of nationalization. This change of policy is examined in this article. Though post-war Labour manifestos pledged to nationalize sections of the wholesaling industry, and despite the fact that the party under Attlee discussed the nationalization of wholesaling at length, the industry remained in private hands. An attempt to understand how and why the nationalization of wholesaling was opposed within the party and shelved by the Attlee governments is central to this study. © 2007 Oxford University Press.

This comparative, feminist research reveals that women from cooperative group farms are generally as marginalized as their counterparts on conventional family farms. What women do, how they see themselves, and how others see them, reflect a dynamic and complex interplay among the social relations of production, reproduction, and consumption.

It is based on research into Dutch EC, which have about 10,000 members, of which a quarter are non-farmers. The paper details the benefits EC have delivered to their members, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, the environment and the rural economy using evidence drawn from interviews with farmer and non-farmer members, farmer non-members, policy makers and academics connected with seven EC. It pays particular attention to the benefits and disadvantages of allowing non-farmer membership. It is argued that EC would be a valuable additional instrument to help deliver landscape-scale environmental, regional and rural policy objectives. However, Dutch EC have received important political and, particularly in their start-up stage, financial support, and similar support would be needed in the UK-it is argued this may be more readily available if UK EC will offer non-farmer membership.

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews conducted with seven managers and 12 employees within an Australian credit union. Questions relate to the causes (work environment conditions) and content (salary, recognition and rewards, trust and fairness, open/honest communication) of the psychological contract. Comparative analysis techniques identify and contrast psychological contract categories of managers and employees. Findings - Although managers and employees shared similar responses as to the state of the psychological contract, they attributed different causes to these states. Managers tended to construct rational explanations and emphasise resource constraints and financial considerations, whilst employees constructed emotional explanations and attributed this situation to an unfair, uncaring or distant management. Employees regarded the Staff Consultative Committee and open-door policies as ""symbolic acts"" rather than genuine attempts to give employees a voice in the company. Practical implications - Aligning the psychological contract espoused by management more closely with that upheld by employees requires managers to adopt more personal, face-to-face communication strategies. The removal of status-related barriers to communication places managers in a better position to explain to employees how the organisation can meet (or not) specific contract expectations and obligations. Originality/value - Paper provides interesting insights into how contracts form within the context of work environment, HRM policy and practice, and cultural factors - work context factors largely ignored by psychological contract researchers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,10.1108/13581980710726769,Banks; Co-operative organizations; Governance; India; Regulation
,organizational dimensions of decentralized forest management: lessons from a farmers' cooperative in central mexico,Raufflet E.; Barragán P.M.,Unasylva,416436,57,1,22-27,2006,,,"Purpose-To argue a case for a paradigm shift in the way urban cooperative banks (UCBs) are managed, governed, and regulated in India to enable them to enhance their contributions to achieving greater degree of financial inclusion, and more broad-based growth. Design/methodology/approach-The paper first surveys the quantitative importance of the UCBs in India, and their key performance indicators. Various official reports by the countrys Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and other relevant organizations are used extensively. The paper then identifies key areas of reforms, centering primarily on the current business model, governance and regulation practices, and capital adequacy. It then argues for a change in a paradigm shift by the UCBs, and how better governance and regulatory structure can assist this shift. Findings-The paper finds that if the UCBs are to remain relevant and play a significant developmental role in India, they will require same quality of governance and regulation as well as professionalism and modernization as the mainstream commercial banks. The governance and regulatory structures need to be brought in conformity with Indias current and prospective economic structure; and relevant laws modernized. This requires a paradigm shift in the role of UCBs. Research limitations/implications-The research has been based primarily on secondary sources, particularly various reports by the RBI, the countrys Central Bank. Better understanding of the reasons for differences between well-governed and financially sound UCBs on one hand, and those that are not, requires focused interviews and more searching examination of the operating environment and financial statements of a sample of the UCBs. This could be the next stage of research. Originality/value-This paper represents a part of public debate on ways of integrating the UCBs into the mainstream banking sector. This is an important public policy issue as even though the UCBs represent relatively small proportion of the total banking assets, they still represent a systemic risk to Indias financial system, and without reforming them, broad-based economic growth would be difficult to achieve. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,

Data were collected from 120 poultry farmers through a structured interview schedule. The study concluded that poultry farmers prefer and use self-compounded feeds (SCF) instead of commercially compounded feeds (CCF) because (a) self-compounded feeds are of better quality than commercially compounded feeds, (b) there are no quality control measures in the poultry feed industry in the Oyo Area, (c) commercially compounded feeds cost more than self-compounded feeds, and (d) farmers choose feed based on the perceived quality of the feed, their technical ability to produce feed by themselves, the cost of CCF, the storability of feed, and the cost and availability of transportation. Based on these findings, it is recommended that interested public and private agencies should organize annual extension workshops and training for poultry farmers in the study area on (a) feed formulation; (b) feed ingredient mixing and compounding; (c) selection of ingredients, mixtures, and additives; and (d) the establishment, operation, and maintenance of feed mills.

Short training sessions were found to be equally effective at communicating HIG technology to farmers as longer on-farm trials. Both forms of extension were more effective than farmer-to-farmer communication at producing higher fish yields. Yields across all groups, however, were significantly lower than HIG-projected yields, suggesting that extension methodology did not exclusively affect production in this system. Farmer income, land holdings, attitudes, predisposition to risk, and fertilizer price all may have affected production. Improving production will involve a multifaceted approach, possibly including development of less capital-intense technologies, focus on short training sessions, encouragement of farmer cooperatives, and advocacy of economic policies that improve farmer access to credit and local markets.",,10.1016/j.socec.2004.04.010,Agency theory; Agricultural cooperatives; Incentives; Property rights

The paper argues that more local ownership and the co-operative organisational form may ensure a higher level of corporate responsibility The paper is mainly discursive, although three case-studies of companies are used to illustrate the argument: Shell, Vaux Brewery, and Tower Colliery. The central findings are that the nature of ownership, the scale of an enterprise, and the governance form are key considerations in terms of the corporate responsibility of firms. Further explorations of CSR in relation to the nature of governance and ownership of firms, and the scale of their operations, would develop and explore this paper's central argument further and thus provide more valuable insights. The paper suggests that the issue of scale and the role of co-operatives may be of more significance as corporate governance comes under greater scrutiny and sustainability plays a more central role in business practice.

This support was enhanced by the institutional mechanisms of the land reform process, particularly land reform committees (n?chi iinkai), in which the Socialists played a predominant role. However, as the land reform process came to an end, the Socialists were unable to capture an emerging site of institutional influence over farmers, agricultural cooperatives (n?ky?). This failure was due to Socialist fragmentation and competition for power in farmer unions with the Japan Communist Party and in the agricultural cooperatives with centrist conservative forces. The result was that the Socialists lost a key constituency that came to be dominated by the conservatives. Nonetheless, this conservatism of Japanese farmers was not due to inherent cultural orientations of the rural population nor was it simply a product of land reform. The transformation of farmers into a key pillar of conservative party support was the outcome of a political process. © The Author 2005.

The first, Néguac, is located in a rural environment with important economic challenges. The second, Moncton-Beauséjour, is located in a very prosperous economic environment. These two credit unions have the additional characteristic of having experienced a merger in the past few years. We find that the role of management greatly differs from that of community's expectations. In an urban setting, competition is fiercer, management can focus more on its credit union's operations and is less scrutinized for its contribution to community. In a rural setting, parochial considerations are important, as are the credit union's contributions to various community projects. In both cases, the personal ties between employees and clients are very important social assets for the credit unions. Our study shows that even with the economic pressures justifying mergers and the re-engineering of activities, governance practices solidly rooted in the community remain important and tend to be preserved. Several facts reflect the influence of social cohesion on governance in a context of rationalization (mergers and re-engineering). This being said, we see signs that these social roots of governance evolve according to a widening of the territory of the reference community, possibly leading to a weakening of the links between governance and the parochial community and a strengthening of the links between governance and the province's francophone community.",,,Bulgaria; Economics; Peanut production; Transition

They have both economic and social goals. Over this last decade they have achieved remarkable growth levels and currently there are 600 such organisations in Ireland, with approximately 50 per cent of the adult population of Ireland belonging to a credit union. Accounting for credit unions is a much-neglected area and relatively little is known about the sector's accountability. This paper presents the results of an initial empirical study of the financial accountability of Irish credit unions. A series of interviews and a basic content analysis of 178 recent financial statements were used to identify the views of key stakeholders with respect to the discharge of financial accountability by credit unions and the current quality of financial reporting. Overall, the research points to a sector where financial accountability through the medium of the annual report is weak and possible adverse consequences of this are explored. On the basis of the interviews it is suggested that if changes in financial accountability are to be achieved then some more proactive engagement of parties external to the management of individual credit unions is needed. © 2004, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The first result shows an average rate of decline in the number of UBPC of around 60 units per year. Parameters measuring production also show average annual negative rates of decline: 38,800 harvested hectares, and 860,000 tons of sugarcane. Agricultural yields remained stable during the study period. Other important indicators such as revenue, cost and profitability also show negative trends.

The study reveals that the constraints related to inputs like high price of weedicides, pesticides and fungicides and lack of irrigation facilities were very serious in nature. Failure of crop due to unfavourable weather conditions and using of seeds without treatments were very serious and lack of knowledge about time of application and recommended dose of fertilizers were serious constraints in production. In case of marketing of produce, the constraints like distress sale due to immediate need for money was very serious, whereas lack of warehousing facilities, lack of procurement of produce by government, low support price of produce and lack of co-operative organization for marketing of produce were found to be serious. Lack of demonstrations and trials of pearl millet production were considered to be very serious constraints by the respondents. The serious constraints identified by the farmers in case of technical guidance were lack of guidance for controlling insects-pests and application of pesticides and fungicides, lack of guidance for chemical weed control and chemical weedicides, lack of guidance for seed treatment, lack of knowledge of current advances for pearl millet production and lack of knowledge of recommended dose of chemical fertilizers.

,cooperative-shareholder relations in agricultural cooperatives in turkey,Özdemir G.,Journal of Asian Economics,10490078,16,2,315-325,2005,,,"This article reports the findings of a project entitled 'The participation of members in mutual businesses'. A previous project developed a theoretical model of what makes people participate, focusing on the participation of public service users in council housing and social care services. The current project builds on this work, applying the 'mutual incentives model' to a population sample of area committee members and a random sample of non-participant members of a very large UK consumer co-operative, the Co-operative Group. Two arguments are presented as to why such research is needed. First, member participation in co-operative and mutual businesses is becoming an important issue both for this sector and more generally for public policy. Second, a comparison between a public services setting and a co-operative setting enables us to extend and further test the theoretical model. Two main features of the model are outlined: a 'mutual incentives theory' that goes beyond other models to combine individualistic and collectivistic motivations, and the 'participation chain', a synthesis of existing knowledge that joins motivations to three 'links' that we call 'resources', 'mobilization' and 'dynamics'. The article then summarizes the project methodology, and reports the main findings. As in the public services project, on the 'demand' side, collectivistic incentives prove to be dominant over individualistic, but with some individual 'internal' benefits also being important. On the 'supply' side, skills derived from previous experience were important, as were a positive evaluation of opportunities to participate, and recruitment through existing networks. We then compare the findings to those from the public service users and from a regional co-operative society; Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Co-op. Collective motivations are dominant in all three datasets, but are shown to vary in interesting ways that have important implications for member participation strategies. © CIRIEC 2004.

Despite their apparent growth in number, agricultural cooperatives have made only a limited impact on economic, social, and industrial development of the country and democratization of the agricultural sector and the community. The reasons for these pertain to some basic problem areas such as finance, integration, training and research, administration, legislation, and auditing [Mülayim, Z. G. (2003). Kooperatifçilik, Yetkin Yayinlari. Ankara]. To further explore these problem areas, this paper focuses on cooperative-shareholder relations in three major types of cooperatives in Turkey. According to the survey results, ADCs have emerged as the most prominent type of cooperative in terms of their members' participation into cooperative activities. The research results suggest that all members of ADCs were actively engaged in trading with their cooperatives, whereas 90% of members in ASCs and 80% in ACCs were trading with their cooperatives. When the three types of cooperatives are compared to each other with respect to members' perception of democratic administration, relations with the state organs, awareness of cooperative principles, and frequency of visits to cooperatives, ADCs are in a favourable position compared to ACCs and ASCs. The same situation is also valid for economic relations and interest in financial matters. ACCs come first in supplying farm inputs and they are followed by ASCs. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Agriculture is the main occupation of the people. Several methods were used to collect information. These included group discussions and questionnaires. Results from the study show that women have played a major role in almost every aspect of agriculture. Farmers possess valuable knowledge of the natural resources in their environment. They have made use of changes in soils and topography, which have resulted in planting patterns in the scattered farms around the villages and distant farm plots. With the help of cooperatives, farmers are taught how to develop innovatory regenerative techniques to conserve the tree stock on the farm. These techniques focus around the preservation of forest species.

Case studies of the three cooperatives are conducted, focusing on the organizational structures in terms of collective versus individualized attributes. The dissolution of the New Zealand Dairy Board created new market opportunities for the cooperatives. Hence, the co-operatives had reason to develop new market strategies, and in order to pursue these well, they changed their organizational structures.

If cooperative formation is rational when market imperfections arise, we might wonder if dissolution is rational when the imperfections fade. In this article, we show that the answer is yes. More generally, we show that cooperatives would wish to choose from a continuum of cooperative, new-generation, and IOF models as market conditions and interest groups vary. For this purpose, we develop a general organizational framework of the agricultural processing firm, paying attention to the mechanisms distinguishing the cooperative from the IOF structure, the tension between active and retired members, and the influence of competition in raw and finished product markets. Optimality is considered first from the perspective of the cooperative member, in terms of maximizing the expected present value of net cash flows, then from the perspective of the policy maker, in terms of minimizing the probability of financial ruin. We find, as markets become increasingly competitive, that a traditional cooperative encourages lower investment and higher probability of bankruptcy than does the IOF. However, member's willingness to capitalize the cooperative improves abruptly as inactive members gain influence on the cooperative board or as the firm's financial structure merges toward the IOF model. Our findings are illustrated using data from the internal records of Tri Valley Growers, which until its bankruptcy in 2000 was on of the nation's leading agricultural processing cooperative.

This makes them a potential tool in the fight against financial exclusion. Yet, the UK credit union movement is not regarded as being successful, even though there is evidence of much financial exclusion. This study is cross sectional in form, and evaluates characteristics that may contribute to the success of the UK credit union movement at national and regional level, in 2000. The findings are used to consider the impact of recent regulatory changes on the movement. The key findings are that there is a significant relationship between the success of a credit union, its size and the deprivation of the ward from which it sources its members. More specifically, larger credit unions and those located in more affluent wards, are more successful. Affiliation to the Irish League of Credit Unions and having a common bond of occupation, are also found to be contributing factors to credit union success. These results are taken as providing support for the recent changes implemented by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which is likely to result in the emergence of larger credit unions (through mergers), run by appropriately qualified persons, serving a more mixed-income membership base.

E.,Biological Agriculture and Horticulture,1448765,24,4,379-396,2007,,,"Since Vietnam applied the ""Doi Moi-Renovation"" policy in 1986, and especially in 1988, the contract system between agricultural cooperatives and farmers was applied in agricultural production. Furthermore, the Land Law in 1993 indicates that farmers could use their land for the long-term (from 20 to 50 years). Therefore, land fragmentation in Vietnam has become a common phenomenon in all localities. This paper aims to provide an analysis of land reform and LC processes in Vietnam. In this regard, the study concentrates on the following issues: (1) to trace back former land reform in the period 1945-1953, in order to identify its results and errors; (2) to analyze contemporary LC in terms of an institutional analysis from the national to the commune level; (3) to study the procedure of LC in Dong Long Commune, Tien Hai District, Thai Binh Province. The main results of thi s research can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the land reform program carried out in the period 1953-1956 included 3 principal stages. The main objective of the program was to reduce the influence of colonists, feudalists and landlords by redistributing land to the landless peasants and laborers. As a result, over 810,000 hectares of land which belonged to them were confiscated, requisitioned, and purchased by the government. The land was then redistributed to 2,104,138 landless households, including 8,323,636 peasants and laborers. Secondly, a significant result of the LC process was to reduce by 50 % the total number of land parcels in Dong Long Commune. There were two general impacts of this process: (1) farmers were able to shorten the distance from their houses to the land parcels. Therefore, labor costs as well as long-term investment were reduced, resulting in increased benefits from agricultural production. (2) Land management activities at the commune level became much more effective because of the reduction in the number of parcels as a result of combining public land into a bigger area and building up the Land Use Planning Program for long-term developmment.",,10.1080/01448765.2007.9755034,

Ten farm pairs, each of which consists of one organic and one conventional farm with less than 10 ha of fig plantation, were selected from five Fig Sales Cooperative (Taris-Incirbirlik) regions of Aydin Province with varying agro-ecological conditions. Although six of the organic farms matched or exceeded the production of their conventional counterparts, the three-year mean yield of the organic farms as a group was 5% lower than that of the conventional farms. However, excluding organic certification costs, mean variable costs and net income were similar for both groups, mainly because organic price premiums received by the farmers compensated for lower yields. If current organic certification costs paid by firms are included to farm budgets, the price premiums paid to organic producers would have to increase to 22% in order to equal the net incomes from conventional dried fig. Conventional farmers identified low and unstable prices as the main constraints for sustained production and stated further intensification of production as their main goal. Organic farmers focused on farm diversification and agronomic practices that permit organic farm management. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1108/13527600610643493,Co-operative marketing; Human resource management; Intellectual capital; Learning organizations; Personnel administration

The purpose being to identify the benefits, limitations and lessons for the management of people in the co-operative and mutual sectors. Design/methodology/approach  The problem of inadequate Personnel or HRM systems in the majority of co-operatives has been established by the author over a period of seven years, field work with co-operative organizations including the international co-operative alliance (ICA), asian confederation of credit unions (ACCU), and the British society for co-operative studies. Direct interviews and a sample of HRM and Membership Relations audit forms developed as part of the ongoing field research and special project work have been applied to various co-operative contexts in all the regions of the ICA. Findings  The findings are that co-operatives generally are lagging behind the private sector in their application of all four approaches. Mostly smaller co-operatives lack effective basic personnel systems and few of the larger co-operatives go beyond HRM. This failure to develop clear programs for the utilization and development of their people is a missed opportunity. Practical implications  The membership base and its roots in a community of shared interests means that, whilst co-operatives have lessons to learn from all four approaches, they can and must go beyond them if they are to optimize their people-centered business advantage in the marketplace.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based initiatives at achieving sustainable consumption objectives. Design/methodology/approach  A new multi-criteria evaluation tool is developed, from New Economics theory, to assess the effectiveness of initiatives at achieving sustainable consumption. The key indicators are: localisation, reducing ecological footprints, community building, collective action and creating new socio-economic institutions. This evaluation framework is applied to an organic producer cooperative in Norfolk, UK, using a mixed-method approach comprising site visits, semi-structured interviews and a customer survey. Findings  The initiative was effective at achieving sustainable consumption in each of the dimensions of the appraisal tool, but nevertheless faced a number of barriers to achieving its potential. Research limitations/implications  Future research could examine the sustainability preferences of non-consumers of local or organic food, to compare responses and assess the scope for scaling up initiatives like this. Practical implications  Ways forward for community-based sustainable consumption are discussed, together with policy recommendations. Community-based initiatives such as the local organic food network examined here should be supported to offer a diversity of local action.

An analysis of the changes that have taken place in the moshav in the past few decades reveals a process of rural restructuring, similar to that which is occurring in many developed countries. New economic activities have replaced farming as sources of income, and newcomers, mostly of urban origin, have invaded rural communities in search of a better quality of life. These changes derive from a combination of structural changes in agriculture, changing government policies and cumulative decisions of rural households. The result is a more heterogeneous moshav-physically, economically and socially, and growing regional, inter-village and intra-village disparities. These developments have a direct impact on the organizational structure of the moshav, its environmental qualities and its exchange relations with the urban sector. As part of the ongoing process of change the moshav is gradually losing some of its unique features, which formed the basis for its identity as a special type of rural community. This leads to the question of whether the moshav will be able to develop a new identity as a distinct type of rural community, or turn into a suburban or urban community. The answer will depend largely on the direction taken by government policy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,
,fair-trade coffee in nicaragua and tanzania: a comparison,Pirotte G.; Pleyers G.; Poncelet M.,Development in Practice,13649213,16,5,441-451,2006,,,"We examine some characteristics of agricultural and rural cooperatives and their management challenges, in order to illustrate possible applications of Jim Collin's management concept, catalytic mechanisms, in the cooperative context. Agricultural cooperatives are experiencing complex governance issues, particularly in light of increased heterogeneity of member interests, and increased market and regulatory pressures. Member commitment is often recognized to be a necessary ingredient in the cooperative success, and while primary agricultural cooperatives are built on that commitment, new generation cooperatives need not be. In this article we argue that some of the governance issues may be alleviated by the application of creating catalytic mechanisms, a process that builds cohesion, preserves cooperative identity, and is based on cooperative principles and values. We illustrate this technique with examples of successful agricultural and rural cooperatives that already use such mechanisms in their management strategies.",,10.1080/09614520600792390,

Illustrating how fair trade evolves differently according to context, the article examines how the co-operative movement in Nicaragua has been strengthened by fair-trade production, in contrast to the situation in Tanzania.

Participation is however quite a challenge for a country with a long tradition of top-down management and a strong bottom-up dependence on public provisioning. In such a setting, it may not be surprising that the experiences with public participation in forestry in Turkey are mixed. There are some positive initiatives like the creation of farmer's cooperatives and NGOs, but their role is quite limited and small of scale.

A case study in southern Brazil examines a situation in which the lack of effective monitoring and enforcement contributed to the decline of a cooperative, and asks why these activities were ineffectively applied. The literature suggests that the lack of application would be because the provision of monitoring and enforcement is itself a second-order public goods problem in which the whole cooperative benefits from the maintenance of discipline, but the costs fall on individuals who work to maintain it. This case study reveals contextual factors related to motivations for cooperation which may be more important in explaining the reluctance to impose discipline and the subsequent decline of trust and commitment among cooperative members. The study suggests that the components of an effective disciplinary system include rule formulation, monitoring and enforcement activities, accompanied by norms regarding the role of discipline in relation to overall cooperative objectives, and regarding the roles and responsibilities of leadership and general membership.

Agroforestry may offer economically viable windows of opportunity for sustainable use of tropical forests whereas additional funds (e.g. through ""Clean Development Mechanism"") will be required to make re-forestation programs profitable. Alternative management practices in rice-based systems may offer win-win options to reduce emissions and - at the same time - to obtain another improvement in the production system, namely through optimized timing of nitrogen fertilizer, temporary drainage in irrigated rice fields and integrated residue management. Introducing pasture in degraded land can sequester substantial amounts of carbon (similar to re-forestation).

Our main focus is on cooperatives as an alliance between members, but we also discuss alliances between cooperatives.

As member-benefit nonprofit organizations, credit unions rely almost exclusively on voluntary board members in an oversight capacity. Results support the contention that board development practices lead to more capable board members, and the presence of these board members tends to explain board performance.

One is towards the creation of growth processes through formulas which aim to bring under the same roof asset holders who by their very nature are a difficult fit, all the while trying to maintain certain cooperative principles.

Coffee producers are often poor and marginalised, and their situation is aggravated by fluctuating market prices and collusive behaviour among intermediary coffee purchasers. Coffee co-operatives may potentially increase the incomes of these farmers by distributing a larger share of the final price to the co-operative members. Co-operatives can also have a pro-competitive effect on imperfect market situations, and thereby increase income levels also for non members. Moreover, they have the potential to educate and empower marginalised farmers. However, lack of finance and problems with free riding, costs of control and a too short time horizon are problems faced by co-operatives. Because of that, benevolent governments or NGOs have tried to support co-operatives with finance and expertise, but often with an unsuccessful outcome. The Fair Trade system distributes money to small-scale coffee producers via carefully selected co-operatives. The study of Fair Trade co-operatives in Chiapas shows that they are successfully functioning organisations, and that they do seem to have a pro-competitive effect on an imperfect market situation. But the co-operatives also have many disadvantages compared to their private competitors. This means that they could probably not have reached their level of success without the premium received from the alternative markets (Fair Trade and organic). Thus, the support from the Fair Trade system seems to strengthen agricultural co-operatives.",,10.1177/097300520800300206,

Production from the Gulf of Mexico coast makes up 93.4% of national production; during 2000-2002 it reached over 49,000 mT, with value of 9.2 to 15.5 million USD. Production is based on enhanced beds management. It is an activity of social importance, as many coastal communities find their income and work opportunities in it. In the state of Tabasco there are 1,371 oyster fishers in 14 cooperative societies, and 3,000 shuckers. There is an extensive bed management activity with seeding of collected spat and shell laying. Although a minimum legal size of 80 mm is required, it is not observed. We identified the growth equation parameters for size structure data for five beds from three lagoons. Maximum height varied between 118 and 140 mm with means between 58 and 63 mm. The von Bertalanffy growth equation parameters were L8 between 124 and 154 mm, with K between 0.71 and 1.21. In most cases a significant influence of seasonality was detected, mostly during winter, but at some localities it was during summer. Total mortality Z varies from 1.64 to 2.39. As no data on natural mortality M were available we applied 25, 50 and 75% of Z to M, which allowed us to model the behaviour of the populations under different rates of fishing mortality F and the impact of different M in yields. We conclude that the populations are over exploited in size and this is affecting yields. Besides, the populations are at risk of collapse if natural mortality increases awing to any environmental impact. It is recommended to increase mean size to 90 mm which means a minimum catch size of over 70 mm, as required by the official norm, this would increase yields in weight 100% and there would be a significant number of organisms to buffer any increase on natural mortality. © 2007 University of Salento - SIBA http://siba2.unile.it/ese.",,10.1111/1467-8292.00198,

Explicit consideration is given to credit union industries in four countries - Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States. It is argued that in terms of a developmental typology the credit union industry in Great Britain is at a nascent stage of development, the industries in Ireland and New Zealand are at a transition stage while the US credit union industry is mature in nature. In progression between stages the analysis considers the influence of factors such as situational leadership, the complexion of trade associations, professionalisation, regulatory and legislative initiatives and technology. The analysis concluded that while there was a substantial commonality of experience, there were also significant differences in the impact of these factors. This consequently encouraged the recognition of the existence of 'a variety of the species' in respect of credit union development. © 2002 CIRIEC.",,,Farmwomen; Greece; Women's agrotourist cooperatives; Women's cooperatives

Instead, exporters must look beyond the firm's boundary to tap into the distinctive competencies of external actors such as distributors if they want to realize the full potential of their products. Yet, there is little empirical evidence of the strategic impact of resources and capabilities that can be shared in marketing's cooperative relationships. This study raises two research questions: (1) does a firm's relational capability contribute to its export competitive advantages? and (2) does a firm's relational factors make an incremental contribution to its export advantage and performance beyond the contribution of firm factors. A significant conclusion of this study is that after controlling for internal firm factors, relational factors make a unique contribution to both the competitive advantages of the firm and its export performance. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,10.3828/idpr.26.3.3,

Second, it indicates that successful financing strategies are ikely to involve an overlap of both formal and informal practices. Third, in the documented case the tenants' group succeeded in leveraging the development potential of their land to cross-subsidise its housing costs.

The model was conceived as a 'multipurpose unit' aimed at serving its members by supplying credit, improved farm inputs, storage facilities, marketing assistance etc. In practice, however the major function has most often remained limited to the provision of credit and the improved farm inputs. As the bulk of resources have been supplied by the government, cooperatives are as much an agent of government administration, as a voluntary organisation. Even from the narrow perspective of their role as a vehicle for channelling government funds, cooperatives have been more active in distributing loans than in collecting these when due. The Punjab cooperatives are rural institutions which permit collective action by the more progressive farmers and which mediate between these farmers and the government. It enables the administration to target benefits and regulatory policy on that group of farmers, large or small, who contribute most to governments development goals-those who adopt improved technology. Nevertheless, cooperatives seem to have been less successful in accomplishing the governments' stated purposes, as the strategy has produced dissemination of benefits generally only to the most privileged sections of the rural society. The wider conclusion is that the experience in the Punjab hardly amounts to a test of the appropriateness of the institution of cooperatives as a development agent. The divided and hierarchical social structure of rural Punjab may point to the need for greater appropriateness of some alternative institutional device to encourage development.",,10.1086/303169,Animal societies; Cooperative breeding; Relatedness; Reproductive skew

Many recent models attempt to explain this variation on the basis that a dominant who benefits from the presence of subordinates may offer them incentives, in the form of reproductive opportunities, to remain in the group. While most societies contain multiple members, however, these models have considered only the relationship between a dominant and a single subordinate or have assumed that all subordinates are identical. We develop an incentive-based evolutionary stable strategy model of reproductive skew in three-member groups, in which subordinates may vary in their opportunities for independent reproduction, their contribution to group productivity, and in their relatedness both to the dominant and to one another. Our model demonstrates that the conclusions of two-member models cannot all be generalized to larger groups. For example, relatedness among group members can influence whether or not the dominant does best to offer staying incentives to subordinates in a three-member, but not a two-member, group. Both the degree of skew and group stability depend on the relatedness between subordinates as well as on the relatedness of each to the dominant, and the incentives that each individual subordinate receives are influenced by the traits of the other. Whether such effects increase or decrease skew and group stability depends crucially on whether a third group member increases group productivity to a greater or lesser extent than the first.",,10.1016/S1057-2317(03)00029-8,

The function of cooperatives was greatly reduced, and the household came to be considered as an autonomous unit of economy. In the process of change in the cooperatives' function, economic activities took on greater importance. A new law on cooperatives in 1996 also promoted the establishment of new types of cooperatives as autonomous economic organizations. Discussions on cooperatives' function, however, have tended to be too abstract and idealized and to lack specific detail. This paper, therefore, evaluates the economic activities of cooperatives based on an analysis of actual economic activities in one village. Coc Thanh Cooperative (CT) in Nam Dinh Province was chosen for a case study, and its cooperative's economic activities were evaluated from the accounts of revenue and expenditure of the Irish potato business, including the cultivation, and the storage and sale businesses. It was found that the executive staff of CT actively managed the potato business and produced a profit for the whole cooperative. They controlled the material cost and the cooperative's profit according to fluctuations in climatic conditions and market prices in order to generate profits both for the potato farmers and for CT. Besides their regular salary, they received a bonus as reward for managing the potato business. Why did the cooperative manage the potato business as CT's business, rather than leaving it to individual farmers? The advantages of having the potato business run by CT were that it could provide funding and information, function as an arbitrator, operate in line with government policy, and perform welfare works. The disadvantage was its economic inefficiency as a profit-making organization. To improve its economic efficiency as a profit-making organization, CT paid a bonus to the executive staff, thereby motivating them to efficient management. CT was an organization with two purposes: the pursuit of economic efficiency and the promotion of welfare works. Since villagers have to get funds by themselves and do public undertakings and welfare works in their own village, economic activities by farmers' associations such as cooperatives should be promoted.",,10.1002/jepp.80,Agroecology; Ecological farming; Olive production; Organic farming; Spain

This will be done in the search for an agroecological strategy in the olive tree organic agricultural sector. A comparative analysis of organic and conventional olive oil production is made: both in economic terms, and regarding employment creation, taking into account its environmental benefits. This will permit us to shed light on certain elements necessary in the design of rural policies linked to this economic sector, and in the family farming social stratum. After a brief analysis of the Andalucían inequality structure in rural areas - both historically and at present times - this work presents the following issues: (i) a systematic characterization of European olive cultivation, with special reference to the Spanish and Andalucían situations; (ii) an exploration of the socio-economic impact of the case study within the context of the major actors involved, and their relations in terms of its reproducibility, taking into account their relationships with institutional and policy arrangements. Organic agriculture in Spain has developed slowly since 1995 - the year in which aid towards this type of production began to be established - and, at present, begins to show an exponential increase. Many farmers began the transition to ecological handling of olive groves. Consequently, the organic management of the olive groves and the sale of organic olive oil can be a stimulus to farmers to increase their profits. Hence, it can be a fundamental pillar on which to establish rural development in areas with a high level of importance concerning this crop. In this work, data clearly show that, in spite of high costs, organic olive farming has advantages over conventional agriculture in terms of incomes and employment.

Experience has led to a sharp turn from supply led finance to developing sustainable financial intermediaries. Having encountered many, detrimental and costly failures with the supply led approach, there is excitement following emerging successes of the 'new approach'. There are several success stories documented from Asia, however these are not replicable in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper presents an emerging sound model of an RFI in the region, i.e. a model built by The Kilimanjaro Co-operative Bank of 1995 and Savings and Credit Co-operatives Societies (The KCB-SACCOS model) in Northern Tanzania. The KCB-SACCOS model has managed to overcome difficulties that have led to failures of former rural financial institutions. The successes of the KCB-SACCOS model are attributed to its foundational basis and key operational features. It is an organisation that originates from the grassroots. There is also a strong sense of ownership by the 'client-owner', democratic leadership at SACCOS and a sound SACCOS' representation at the KCB policy body. SACCOS act as strategic nodes of a web to reach a wide client base. The KCB-SACCO model has strategically tapped on the coffee economy and fits well within the socio-economic milieu of the local people and makes use of principles found in the local informal financial practices. The paper elaborates on these features and draws lessons for one approach to develop sustainable rural financial institutions in sub-Saharan Africa.",,10.1177/097215090200300205,

This spread of the Leviathan has been accompanied by a gradual but pervasive deterioration of governance. There is therefore the need for a new paradigm that recognizes that government failure is a much more important problem than market failure, based on a recognition of the strengths and the weakness of the state and the people. A democratic society has enormous potential for entrepreneurship, innovation and creative development. The people, their diverse forms of activity and association such as companies, cooperatives, societies, trusts and other NGOs must be allowed and encouraged to play their due role. The state must focus on what it alone can do best and shed all activities that the people can do as well or better. The heavy hand of the government in the form of incentives, distorting laws, rules, regulations, procedures and red tape, have also corrupted industry, business and other organized interest groups. These must be removed so as to release the energy of the people. The state should confine itself to managing the economy so as to accelerate employment and income growth in a self-sustaining manner, ensure that all citizens receive their entitlements of basic public goods and services, and empower the poor so that they have equal rights (and responsibilities) with other citizens. © 2002, Sage Publications.

The literature reports that firms are increasingly entering into long-term, high dependency exchanges as a result of: increased demand for quality goods, demand for variability of goods, demand for constant innovation, severe price competition and increasing technology costs. These changes are forcing firms to enter into complex relationships with other firms in order to remain competitive. Examples of such relationships are: relational contracting, network organisations, strategic alliances and horizontal co-operation. The increase in number and complexity of these exchanges in an environment characterised by uncertainty has led to the increased interest in the use of obligation contracting. Furthermore, this interest has been reinforced by the changing nature of products being exchanged. More knowledge-based products and information-based modes of production necessitate the sharing of strategically sensitive data. Hence the rise of importance of obligation contracting is not only due to the increased number of complex exchanges in uncertain environments, but also the very nature of the goods being exchanged.",,10.1525/ah.2004.78.3.317,

Although organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and Schulze-Delitzsch credit cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission of aiding the poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s, however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for promoting urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial institutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new cooperatives contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry into the Czech national life. © 2004 by Agricultural History Society.

The Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, concluded in 1994 as part of the Uruguay Rounds of GATT negotiations, as well as certain biotechnological innovations such as Terminator or Traitor technologies, threaten to further undermine local seed production and consumption by destroying the informal seed sector so central to agricultural production in the region.

Germany's track record in the latter respect is mixed. Intergovernmental rivalries, as well as basic design flaws in European policy are singled out as primary obstacles to more effective cooperation. The overall political context of transboundary regionalism is framed here in terms of Germany's pivotal economic and political role within the overall project of European integration.

Cooperative selling institutions are potential catalysts for mitigating these costs, stimulating entry into the market, and promoting growth in rural communities. Trends in cooperative organization in east-African dairy are evaluated. Empirical work focuses on alternative techniques for effecting participation among a representative sample of peri-urban milk producers in the Ethiopian highlands. The variables considered are a modern production practice (cross-bred cow use), a traditional production practice (indigenous-cow use), three intellectual-capital-forming variables (experience, education, and extension), and the provision of infrastructure (as measured by time to transport milk to market). A Tobit analysis of marketable surplus generates precise estimates of non-participants' 'distances' to market and their reservation levels of the covariates - measures of the inputs necessary to sustain and enhance the market. Policy implications focus on the availability of cross-bred stock and the level of market infrastructure, both of which have marked effects on participation, the velocity of transactions in the local community and, inevitably, the social returns to agroindustrialization.

The elusive nature of trust is also emphasised.

The paper also demonstrates how wider trends in UK retailing favour nationally-organized chains such as the current market leader - Tesco. This inherent inability of the Co-op to compete nationally eventually led to it having to retreat from the successful superstore format so favoured by its rivals.

Participatory appraisal of the fishing community revealed decreasing reliance on fishing income with many fishermen moving away to supplementary occupations because of declining fish catches. Illegal fishing and theft of fishing gear resulting from open access, difficulties encountered in enforcing fisheries regulations and the need for fishermen to find alternative sources of income during low water levels are the major management problems. The top-down centralized management approach previously practised was ineffective in addressing any of these issues. Therefore, the possibilities and limitations for introducing co-management as an alternative management strategy were discussed. Financial hardship coupled with perceived benefits through state sponsored welfare schemes caused a positive attitude change among fishermen, making them respond favourably to fishery management. Establishing a licensing system for controlled access, ensuring greater user-group participation through equitable distribution of state sponsored benefits among members, attempting to enforce penalties for illegal fishing linked with surprise checks to enforce management regulations, and obtaining stakeholder perceptions regarding management issues are some of the recent steps taken by the Fishermen's Co-operative Society which would positively contribute towards developing effective co-management in this reservoir.",,10.1080/02508060308691718,Equity and efficiency; Performance; Smallholder irrigation; Socioeconomic; Zimbabwe

Three smallholder irrigation management systems namely the government managed Agritex, the farmer managed community, and the informal bani (dambo) are compared. In the Agritex schemes, participating in labor groups is the only variable influencing financial performance. None of the variables studied are important on the community schemes, perhaps because unlike on Agritex schemes, where the government makes production decisions, community scheme farmers make their own decisions. In the bani schemes, marketing cooperatives, credit use, literacy, record keeping, and the gender of the plot holder are significant. The government should consider extending credit, developing sustainable production recommendations, and developing training programs directly applicable to the bani environment. The bani system achieves the most equitable income distribution and is more efficient than both the community and Agritex systems. The government policy of ignoring this system in development efforts directly contradicts the concepts of equity and efficiency. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1108/01409170110782739,Credit unions; Customer service; Financial institutions; Human resource management

Because of these constraints, small scale tanneries can not afford to have their own effluent treatment facilities and therefore, combined effluent from all tanneries are to be brought to a centralized place for treatment. This facility is called a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). For operation and maintenance of CETP, small scale tanners formed a co-operative society. The expenses for operation and maintenance of CETP are being shared by participating tanneries. Wastewater management for the cluster of small scale tanneries was studied in details and various measures were incorporated to improve performance of the CETP and also to improve treated effluent quality to confirm standard prescribed by regulatory agencies. Performance of existing CETP was evaluated. Based on the results, bench scale laboratory treatability studies were conducted for improvement in treated effluent quality and also to suggest appropriate modifications to the CETP.

,an exploratory study on the cues that signal value to members in retail co-operatives,Leblanc G.; Nguyen N.,International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management,9590552,29,1,49-59,2001,,,"This paper reviews the current regulatory framework for community development financial institutions (CDFIs), which aim to enable socially excluded people and enterprises to access finance. Its focus is primarily on the UK, though account is taken of developments in other EU member countries and at the EU level. In the UK the most developed regulations relate to industrial and provident societies, which are essentially financial cooperatives lending to small enterprises and not for profit organisations, and credit unions, which tend to concentrate on personal savings and finance. CDFIs lie on the boundary of what is currently understood to be charitable status, but the Charity Commission announced a new charitable purpose, community capacity building, in December 2000 and committed to developing clear guidelines on the charitability of CDFIs by the end of 2001. Current regulatory arrangements are assessed and it is found that, apart from credit unions, which have been brought under the supervisory wing of the Financial Services Authority, CDFIs tend to operate in a context of benign neglect. While recognising that heavy-handed regulation might stifle growth, it is argued that the downside of neglect could be uncertainty, which might also blight the development of the sector. An alternative, relatively liberal, regulatory framework is proposed, including self-regulation for the smaller institutions via associations. It is concluded that the type of regulation should vary with the size, status (mutual vs non mutual), and source of finance (deposits vs risk capital). © Henry Stewart Publications, 1358-1988.",,10.1108/09590550110366361,Canada; Co-operative organization; Organizational structure; Retailing; Value

In descending order of importance these factors are: the co-operative form of organisation, contact personnel, in-store specials, responsiveness, communication policy, and price comparisons. Price comparisons with the products/services offered by competing retail stores were found to have a negative impact on the members assessments of value. Moreover, when comparing value judgements on the basis of the variables, education and number of years the respondents had been with the co-op, the results showed that the more educated the members were, the more likely they were to give feedback to the organisation. In addition, members that had been with the co-op for one to three years were more apt to believe that management would respond to their suggestions than the respondents who had been with the co-op for more than nine years.

The policy was disallowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1998, but revalidated by the U.S. Congress later that year. Allowing credit unions to attach multiple membership groups has contributed significantly to rapid growth in the industry. As credit unions add unrelated groups and expand, the prospects for separation between ownership and control increases, creating potential agency control problems. This potential is compounded by the one member, one vote governance structure of credit unions. This research finds empirical evidence that agency problems grow as credit unions add membership groups and members. If a credit union takes on more than one membership group, and as membership increases, management is apparently able to channel residual earnings away from members (in the form of higher net interest margins) toward itself (higher salaries and operating expenses). © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Large multi-nationals have moved to take advantage of these developments with the construction of agri-food chains. These chains are being facilitated via various mergers, acquisitions, and alliances, with the power, and deepening power of such deep-pocket organizations as Cargill, ADM, and ConAgra. Cooperatives have been integrated into these chains for their core competencies, generally for their supply functions, and capacity to handle primary commodities. These direct links to the farmers serve as markets for biotechnology innovations, and as a source of raw material for later processing. Agricultural cooperatives in general are not well suited to compete with these giants, given they are highly specialized at the first handler level. However some cooperatives are able to enter the competition along the lines of multi-nationals competition, i.e. non-price competition in product differentiation, branding, advertising, research and capacity expansion. Farmland, Gold Kist, AGP, Land O'Lakes and Growmark are examples. The cost of these positionings is to shift these organizations toward positions that are characteristically less cooperative, and more bureaucratic, and more top down, though likely more efficient, and with greater market penetration.",,,

These results tend to suggest a more active role for this segment of the rural society so as to achieve rural development through combining women and livestock development. In the light of these results, the following policy suggestions are made to fully and productively exploit the women-livestock linkage. (i) Channels of information, credit, inputs and access to markets have to be aimed at women as they played a very important role in livestock keeping and decisions related to livestock productions. (ii) The existing extension set-up working to promote livestock production in the rural areas has a typical social obstacle not being able to contact the farm women to extend transfer of technology. This difficulty poses problems for the extension wing to approach those who actually undertake and decide livestock production activities. This warrants positioning appropriate female frontline extension officers to interact and offer first hand information to the farm women. (iii) There is also the need for bringing the services available to rear the animals physically closer to women. (iv) In spite of the fact that there is a close and more productive association between farm women and livestock, women participation in training programmes have not been satisfactory, primarily due to the socioeconomic impediments that exist. Hence, efforts are the need of the hour to make appropriate measures to train the farm women in scientific management practices. (v) Promoting intensive livestock rearing in the rural areas may encourage the females to participate more in livestock keeping as this practice did not require farm women to take animals for grazing far away from home.

Findings suggest that in both co-ops, trust among members and trust between members and co-op management are important predictors of group cohesion, which is a measure of the strength of members' desires to remain in a group (co-op) and their commitment to it.

They are questioned about their organizational and management framework, their relations with local communities and with the market. In Italy, there is an ongoing debate relating to how cooperatives at large should or are supposed to evolve in a context in which the market pressure seems to overcome the traditional characteristics of the cooperative movement (mutuality, solidarity, the ""one head one vote"" principle, and so on). How to adequately balance the innovation thrust and the cooperative principles? How can agricultural cooperatives develop in the face of the ever overwhelming market forces? Is the legal framework provided for cooperatives still competitive? By taking into account the long-rooted experience of agricultural cooperatives in the County of Trento, the authors intend to analyze the main economic, organizational and legal problems affecting these cooperatives. On examining these problems, the article also intends to bring about some proposals and recommendations for the future developments of agricultural cooperatives.",,10.1080/12265080108449835,

In addition, trust derived from a unique environment based on a village structure where a few families dwell not to mention ""everyone knows each other well"" has also become institutionalized. In this setting, a complex and multi-dimensional property rights could have developed. Moreover, the Confucian order, historically institutionalized in China, has differentiated the respective roles of the public from the private and the center from the local through a network intertwined by relationships (guanxi-based network), allowing them to be relatively autonomous from each other (embedded autonomy). This institutional tradition of the Chinese society has re-emerged with the coming of the reform age. The reform reintroduced the revival of the traditional family household, as a cooperative unit for the insiders and, at the same time, as a competitive unit against the outsiders; and its renewed close relationship with the local governments have given birth to the township village enterprises. Based on reforms of this nature, which have occurred from the bottom and approved by the center state ex post, China was able to experience the implementation a new form of transition to capitalism, i.e., rural industrialization. In this process, China's guana-based township-village enterprises were able to secure the fitness to react to market competition despite their collective ownership nature.",,,

Although the practice of growing trees by the Indian farmers is as old as the cultivation of crops, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 first articulated the need for government involvement in this activity on a significant scale. Consequently, social forestry projects were started by many of the State Governments in India in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Later, the National Forest Policy of 1988 also emphasised the role of social forestry as a source of raw materials for forest-based industries. This paper attempts to describe and evaluate three of the social forestry development models, namely, the State Forest Departments (SFD) model; the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) model; and the Tree Growers' Co-operative Societies (TGCS) model. Each model is presented briefly and illustrated through a case study. The evaluation is done using the criteria of efficiency, sustainability, equity, and people's participation.

The declining yield in the farmer's fields as a result of waterlogging and salinity is referred to highlight the need for drainage in the area. Evidence is presented to show that implementation of drainage will strengthen the financial position of the society since it is linked with the financial position of its members. The society is keen to takeover the small drainage infrastructure created and if appropriate funds and institutional support is available, to expand this activity. If the society takes over the project upon withdrawal of government support, this society would be the only one that would truly show the concept of irrigation and drainage go together being handled by a single society.",,,Ludhiana Surveys; Rodent Baits

However, in general they expressed dissatisfaction about the effectiveness of zinc phosphide baiting for which the major causes were found to be the lack of pre-baiting, use of incorrect methods of bait preparation, multiple baitings of zinc phosphide at short intervals and non-removal of left over rodenticide bait and dead rodents after the treatments leading to poison-bait shyness and individual rather than campaign approach to rodent control. Village level training and field demonstrations organized with the help of three organizations of the village, namely, the Pendu Vikas Ate Mulazam Bhalai Sanstha Sangh, the Siar Pandher Co-operative Society and the Gram Panchayat, to an assembly of about fifty farmers resulted in partial success as determined on the basis of post-training survey of these parameters from a sample of 20 farmers in adoption of regular rodent control at recommended timings (45%) and pre-baiting before the use of zinc phosphide (25%) with correct method of bait preparation (60%). However, only three farmers (15%) treated rodents in the uncultivated and wasteland areas adjoining their crop fields and only one (5%) organized rodent control on large areas along with his neighbours. No farmer could be convinced for removing left over rodenticide bait and dead rodents from the fields after the treatments. Farmer's field demonstration trials were carried out at four fields each of 7.5 hectare size in different blocks of the village. Rodenticide treatments under experts' supervision in the fields designated as maintenance (M) fields resulted in 94.94% rodent control with 0.005% bromadiolone followed by 2% zinc phosphide baiting in rice fields and 85.42% with 2% zinc phosphide followed by 0.0375% Racumin baiting in wheat fields. With the absence of the expert during the treatment in N1 fields with free supply of rodenticide and education and training, rodent control success decreased non-significantly which further decreased significantly without the free supply of rodenticides as in N2 fields both during the kharif and rabi seasons. The reference fields (R) had more rodent damage than in the treated fields.

Based on a survey of 500 Irish credit unions, this study explores the role of women in credit unions. Judged against participation rates for women in the labor market and in specific organizations such as trade unions, the study suggests that gender balance in credit unions is superior to that elsewhere in Irish society. There is, however, some evidence of gender imbalance in the composition of credit union boards with this being most visible for key decision-making positions such as Chair and Vice-Chair. It also emerges that gender imbalance becomes more pronounced for larger credit unions supporting the contention that women are found in greater numbers on small and less well-connected not-for-profit boards.",,,Agrotourism; Bottom-up approach; Greece; Rural tourism; Women in rural areas; Women's agrotourist cooperatives; Zagora

Despite these changes, agricultural raw material markets are increasingly characterised by the vertical co-ordination of farmers and processors. The organisational form of a marketing co-operative is a common means adopted by farmers to achieve this end. In a world increasingly concerned with the importance of the separation of ownership and user, the survival and growth of agricultural co-operatives (in which the primary users of the services are also the main owners) is linked to their economic role, to how members exercise their property rights, and how inputs are used by the co-operative. This paper provides a function that summarises the economic role of agricultural co-operatives and goes on to analyse the contribution to the economic performance of Portuguese wine co-operatives (PWCs) made by the use of property rights, and the skills of the human resources and technology employed. The results of a multinomial logit model show that PWCs would indeed be able to improve their economic performance through the application of integrated management strategies to solve common property and horizon problems, as well as increasing their recruitment of skilled professionals in the areas of management, wine production and marketing, and by the adoption of new technologies of production and packaging. © 2002 CIRIEC.",,10.1080/714003575,

The modern nation-state has undergone significant changes both in terms of its purpose and sovereignty. States have traditionally been based on territorial factors. Increasingly, however, state participation in the global economy has led to the former's integration with the latter and, consequently, an increased degree of interdependence among states. The result has been the rise of trading states which measure themselves by their relative shares of the global economy and not by territorial size or military power. The pervasiveness of economic interdependence has constrained both internal and external aspects of state sovereignty. States must harmonize internal policies to conform to the requirements of international institutions and regimes. In addition, the growing power of domestic actors has forced decision makers to take greater cognizance of the domestic audience, and has led to the phenomenon of two-level game, in which domestic considerations impact on international relations and vice-versa. At the same time, participation in IOs and regimes constrain a state's external sovereignty by limiting policy choices and enforcing compliance with international obligations. This erosion of the traditional conceptions of state sovereignty has been accelerated by a combination of the increased power of international regimes and domestic forces, and the increased mobility of capital and labour. These factors have led to the development of what Richard Rosecrance has termed the virtual state. But as this combination of factors has constrained state sovereignty in several areas, it has also augmented the power of the state in other spheres. The member-state has evolved as an enhanced nation-state that has access to greater resources than any political unit had in the past, with the exception of the empire. Significantly, unlike the empire, the member-state has the means to retain the loyalty of its citizenry. Further, in exchange for the constraints placed upon individual states by international regimes and the global economy, states have greater access to private goods, capital and labour, and public goods such as the free market. Cooperative efforts between states also produce enhanced capabilities and greater relative gains. The process of harmonization between states' domestic norms and rules and international norms and rules has provided domestic actors with justification to pursue what might otherwise be unpopular domestic programmes.",,,

Moreover, issues of vaguely defined property rights characteristic of traditional cooperative structures (Cook) also affect the viable contractual forms, suggesting that certain producer owned and controlled organizations may have additional advantages in certain types of contracting arrangements that will be more attractive to member/producers. In this article, we focus on potential contractual design differences between IOFs, traditional marketing cooperatives, and new forms of cooperation including closed membership cooperatives. Beginning with a brief overview of the fundamental dimensions of the economics of transactions, we go on to discuss how differences in organizational structure (property rights allocations, incentives, and performance measures) affect the incentives of the contracting parties and the likely contractural design response.

The privatization process of the former state and collective farms, thousands of hectares in size, has been implemented predominantly by way of decollectivization, restitution and compensation as well as by direct privatization following decomposition into smaller entities. This procedure, though leading to a fragmentation of ownership, has not resulted in fragmented operation here, due to the dominance of new market-conforming smaller cooperatives and other types of corporations. In addition, most new small owners leased their land to the new agricultural cooperatives, though currently the share of small-scale farming especially in Hungary is growing. These new entities, extending over hundreds of hectares, have been mostly owned by managers holding important positions already in the previous political regime and thus experienced in large-scale operation. Consequently the old-new management is able to cope with the new circumstances in the transformed farms, which are still large enough to utilize economies of scale in production. Altogether, over 90% of the agricultural land in the CEFTA is now in private hands. Other crucial reform steps related to farming were massive cuts in agrarian subsidies and the liberalization of agro-food markets and of prices as well. Although the bulk of the institutional transformation of CEFTA agriculture has been completed, problems still to be solved are constituted mainly by the lack of market institutions such as a credit system related to the land market. The urgently needed existence of the land market would generate land prices that can serve as a guideline for borrowers and lenders regarding feasible mortgage values.",,10.1108/00070709710196481,

The important feature of this project is the balance it manages to achieve between a number of potentially competing needs. These include the needs of local people to have a degree of control over, and be practically involved in, the improvement of their immediate environment; to have feedback in terms of aesthetic improvements; and to conserve/enhance the ecological value of the area. Failure to maintain this balance can undermine the viability of such projects.

,professional perspectives of members of agricultural cooperatives: an attitudinal study from the former german democratic republic,Krambach K.,Journal of Rural Cooperation,3777480,20,1,47-66,1992,,,"A stated objective of the Ethiopian Government since it came to power in 1975 has been to increase the production of crops for both domestic consumption and export. Consequently, a number of plans and programs have been proposed and implemented to bring about such development in Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro review of the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land reform of 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the population growth as evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production (1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further deteriorated. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable for agriculture, but only about 19% is cultivated. This suggest an underutilisation of land. Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and education which are essential to development have not been given due attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural technologies used by farmers have changed little in this century. Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most potent economic force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from the central government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total agricultural credit, fertiliser and improved seeds respectively go directly to socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5% of the total cultivated land and 4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises with credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting smallholders, has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in Ethiopia. Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no significant development of agriculture in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform. © 1991.",,,

In order to assess the attitudes of fish farmers towards data management, and discover the major sources of influence upon planning production, a postal survey among 293 salmon and trout farmers was conducted in the summer of 1987. The degree of microcomputer use and the uptake of automation were examined in this perspective. Salmon and trout fanners collected production records which, in most cases, were unsuitable for planning. Microcomputers were used mainly for accounting and word processing. Software was commonly purchasedoff?the?shelf. Computerization when rejected was primarily on grounds of excessive costs and time requirements. Other automation comprised feeding systems and to a lesser extent water parameter monitoring. For decision making, directors and owners relied heavily on their site managers and foremen to provide feedback. When farms were members of marketing cooperatives or owned by larger firms the latter directed their production and outlets. Accountants were employed part?time to draw the financial accounts, and the proportion of fish farms hiring experts and computer consultants was small. The findings showed that information technology is not a priority among fish farm managers. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,10.1080/09669589808667299,
,bank reform: create larger playing field,Barth J.R.; Jahera J.S.,Forum for Applied Research & Public Policy,,7,2,53-57,1992,,,"Many rural communities interested in cultivating tourism while maintaining local control are considering the cooperative form of development. Because this form requires little initial capital investment (which enables local control and self-development) and can be developed in a way that allows for non-economic goals, it can be an important element of sustainable tourism. This article uses qualitative case study analysis and in-depth interviews to examine if the various rationalities within three tourism craft marketing cooperatives in central Appalachia are manifest in their contributions made to the communities in which they are located.The study is theoretically framed by the Weberian concept of formal and substantive rationality. Formal rationality is based on economic goals only, while substantive rationality allows for non-economic goals like improved quality of life and cultural preservation. Results indicate the Weberian framework is a useful device for interpreting whether a tourism-related marketing cooperative organisation's internal goals and priorities are manifest in its external contributions to community. This study is especially useful to rural tourism practitioners interested in maximising often scarce resources in a sustainable manner that maintains local control and ideologies. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This article attempts to consider some of the theoretical and practical implications of this growing role by treating them as value?driven organizations, and asking how this differentiates them, in terms of efficiency and accountability, from public or private agencies. It notes the lack of developed theoretical models capable of dealing with this question, and examines the relevance of existing theories (neo?classical economics, public administration and especially varieties of organization theory including the New Institutional Economics) in dealing with agencies which claim to be dominated by motivations based on democracy and altruism rather than self?interest. The author looks at problems associated with the measurement of efficiency and enforcement of accountability in organizational life and at the need for effective incentives and sanctions which provide a stable basis for maintaining commitment. He then considers the issues involved in the enforcement of accountability to ensure the efficient use of resources in producer co?operatives on the one hand and service delivery NGOs on the other. In the former, the focus is on the strengths and weaknesses of market competition and the costs of collective management; in the latter on the varied relationships between principals and agents' involved in the production and management of services. © 1993 Institute of Social Studies",,10.2307/144264,Agriculture; Cooperatives; Family farms; New Zealand; Producer marketing boards

Critics of producer marketing boards - the New Zealand Department of Treasury, nonfarm capitals, and one corporate agriculturalist - argue on the basis of theoretical efficiency, but offer little empirical evidence. Using insights from the family farm and cooperation literatures, we argue that cooperatives and producer marketing boards help shield family farms from the full costs of market relations, assist shareholders in capturing downstream profits, enable farmers to develop and maintain ownership of new technology, reduce competition among farmers, and allow farmers more control of their industries than would otherwise be the case.",,10.1016/0147-5967(92)90101-C,

The new policies emphasize financial autonomy for state enterprises, and a shift in the responsibilities of the agricultural cooperatives away from collective production activities. Specific policies and institutional arrangements vary considerably among the provinces. In Quang Nam-Da Nang province in central Vietnam, the agricultural cooperatives generally still play an important role in irrigation O&M at the tertiary and quaternary level, serving as intermediaries between individual households and the state enterprise that operates the headworks and the primary and secondary canal network of government irrigation schemes. The cooperatives also have full responsibility for many small pump irrigation schemes. The state irrigation enterprises have partial financial autonomy, financing their activities primarily from irrigation fees collected from the farmers. The power to set the fees, however, resides with the provincial government and not with the irrigation enterprises. The fee, which is an area-based fee differentiated by crop and season, is set in terms of paddy to facilitate maintaining its real value in the face of inflation. Both cost and equity factors are taken into consideration in setting the schedule of fees. The fees in government gravity irrigation schemes are fairly high by comparison with other Asian countries; however they are lower than typically paid by farmers in the small pump irrigation schemes operated by the agricultural cooperatives. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,10.1002/mde.4090140511,

This article explores their price and welfare effects and relates to antitrust legislation in the United States, the European Union some of the EU member states-in particular, Sweden. Welfare is higher with a monopoly cooperative than with a profit-maximizing monopoly, if the scope for price discrimination is small and if the world-market price is low relative to the domestic price. As the world-market price rises (or as price discrimination becomes more important), the welfare effect is reversed. The price-discrimination effect suggests that, as a marketing cooperative integrates vertically, welfare may fall. These results carry over to a duopoly with a cooperative firm and a profit-maximizing firm. In such a duopoly, the cooperative behaves more aggressively and obtains a larger market share. Empirical evidence supports these conclusions. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,

The defects arise from the use of unitary boards which introduce conflicts of interest for directors and reduces both their ability and incentive to improve operational performance. The use of supervisory boards and stakeholder councils to decentralise control, provides a basis for improving the operational performance of directors and their organisation. Also, stakeholder participation provides a way to convert open hierarchies into several decentralised closed loop information and control systems to improve operating performance. Practical examples are found in Japanese keiretsu firms, the employee/consumer co-operatives found around the town of Mondragón in Spain and in the governance of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

This has contributed greatly to the control of water resources, but has also resulted in many involuntary or forced migrations of people from inundated areas. In many studies of the villages lost to dam construction, whether undertaken by geographers, cultural anthropologists, or folklorists, the central concern has been on the ethnology of the former settlement and on the pattern of removal. Other important aspects such as the process of re-settlement, adaption and acculturation of the migrants to their new homes have so far tended to be overlooked. This paper explores the re-settlement process, adaptive strategies, and acculturation of a migrant clan in South Korea. Steward's (1955) cultural core model is applied with respect to the adaptation of migrants to their new communities. The study area is the village of Ilsun-ri in Heapyung-myun, Sunsan County, Kyungpook Province. This village was occupied by migrants from the Chonju Ryu clan in 1987, with most of them coming from several clan villages which were lost in the course of construction of the Imha Dam. Particular attention was paid in this study to villagers from Musil, a native place of the Chonju Ryu clan. Fieldwork took the form of participant observation during January and February, 1991. At that time there were 66 households in Ilsun-ri, and the population was 192. In Section II the cognative structure of the villagers is outlined, followed in Sections III-IV by an examination of villagers occupations, customs, and their adaptive mechanism to their new environment. The main features of this adaptation process can be summarized as follows: These migrants made a collective decision to move in the hope that cultural shock would be lessened and the homogeneity of the clan would be maintained. Since the family heads were mostly middle-aged, and ranked in economic terms in the 'middle-class', the group adapted well to their new milieux. Before migration the Chonju Ryu villagers depended on subsistence agriculture, using manual labour and farm animals, for their livelihood. After migration, the villagers had to cope with many changes in agricultural environment, including climate and quality of arable land. They were also introduced to farm mechanization and improved methods of transportation. It was therefore necessary to switch to production of commercial crops in order for them to remain economically self-reliant. Accordingly, the traditional pattern of labour exchange transformed into one of functional cooperation. Also, some villagers became free to seek employment at the nearby Kumi industrial complex. As a result, the life style of the villagers has become more varied after the migration. Despite these changes, the villagers were able to maintain their traditional ancestral worship practices and Confucian value system. For example, the villagers brought with them symbolic buildings and structures, such as Chongga, Sadang, and Chongja, to set up in the new village. These structures were re-erected in the same spatial arrangement as in the old village, giving full regard to the geomantic traditions of Pung-su and their positions relative to the surrounding mountains and rivers. All this can be viewed as a kind of defensive reaction to new external influences and surrounds, but it is also clear that a necessary part of the villagers adaptive strategy was affirmation of their common ancestral heritage. Finally, it is clear that while the migrants accommodated rapidly the new agricultural technologies and methods of cooperative organization, they maintained many cultural factors related to clan identity. Although the former spirit of cooperation and internal cohesion outwardly appears to have weakened in the village, the migrants have displayed an adaptive mechanism of selective acceptance of new things, while preserving much that reflects the clans identity. These conclusions suggest the Steward cultural core model, which presumes complete acculturation takes place over time, does not fit precisely with the situation described here. © 1997, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

Their development has been shaped by their close ties with local governments and communities. However, as marketization processes dissolve these links, the increasing competitive pressures of the 1990s make the search for new forms of enterprise organization a priority. The shareholding cooperative system (SCS) has been proposed as a method of strengthening enterprise autonomy whilst preserving the predominance of public ownership, and of improving enterprise efficiency by tying performance to profitabilty whilst maintaining some principles of equity. In practice, the new opportunities opened up by reform are often monopolized by those already in positions of wealth and power: local governments and individual entrepreneurs. But workers and local farmers may also become more directly involved in enterprise ownership, gaining a greater say in decision-making. In these cases, the SCS resembles a multi-stakeholder cooperative in which workers, managers, local governments and local farmers negotiate around their stakes in the future of the enterprise.",,10.2307/2118471,

,collective agricultural production: a solution for transition economies?,Deininger K.,World Development,0305750X,23,8,1317-1334,1995,,,"A large share of the agricultural cooperatives currently operating in both the European Union and North America have attributes that coincide with the characteristics of the traditional cooperative model - open membership societies, collective ownership, equal voting power, principles of equality and solidarity, ideological motivation, etc. This cooperative model is, however, constructed for making cooperative business efficient under specific economic conditions, viz., when the average cost curve is continually declining with size (economies of scale) and when the sales price is unaffected by the individual firm's sales volume, either due to agricultural policy or as the firm's supplies are small compared to the size of the market. As these conditions become less and less prevalent in today's business world, a growing number of agricultural cooperatives are abandoning the traditional cooperative model. Instead, a new cooperative model is evolving: The primary and secondary processing operations are organizationally separated, increasing the cooperatives' chances for forward integration in the processing chain. The primary processing is conducted within increasingly larger cooperative societies - some of them even internationally operating. The trade between the cooperative and its members becomes more and more business-like - for example, the cooperative gets more control with the farmers' production, and the farmers get more direct, individualized ownership to the cooperative. The secondary processing is done in private limited companies, owned jointly by the agricultural cooperatives, the farmer members and external investors, and these firms' business conduct resemble that of investor-owned firms.",,10.1016/0305-750X(95)00044-D,

Service cooperatives can utilize economies of scale, enhance competitiveness, and provide technical information, advantages that often outweighed problems of free-riding, low investment, and excessive political intervention. Agricultural collectives, while not adding substantial advantages, are in addition associated with problems of supervision and effort supply, tendencies to substitute casual workers or mechanization for regular members, and low investment incentives. While collective forms of organization in transition economies respond to high risk and market imperfections, they do so inefficiently.

Critical determinants are the proportion of landowners who attempt to create family farms, the pace of creation of new private producer cooperatives or farming companies, the relationship between farm size and productivity and the variables which strengthen or weaken this relationship. The discussion suggests that even after land reform the major share of land and output will remain on a relatively small number of larger farms, and, provided appropriate market incentives exist, the expected gains in technical efficiency from a less polarized farm structure will be reinforced by other factors including labour market, credit and technical change. Productivity in Bulgarian agriculture has the capacity to increase as a result of the land reform.

However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies in 198990, Cuba's inputs of fertilizer, pesticides, and petroleum dropped by more than half Cuba responded with a dramatic shift in its agricultural development model that featured appropriate technology, alternative organization of labor, alternative planning, and environmental preservation. Cuban pest control efforts now focus on biological control and on enhanced monitoring and diagnostic techniques. Soil management emphasizes biofertilizers and vermiculture. Minimum tillage and crop rotation are frequent practices among Cuba's independent farmers, agricultural cooperatives, and state farms. The transition to low-input agriculture has decreased the exodus of people from rural areas to cities, and has lead to establishment of lab or camps with volunteer labor and long-term programs for rebuilding rural communities. To address the loss of important food imports while ensuring environmental conservation, agricultural planning now gives priority to crop rotations, city gardens, and introduction of food crops in sugar cane areas. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

It can support an annual yield of 81?5?1081 and a catch rate of 11.4kg/ha/h. Out of the 28 species present in the river, the most abundant were Clarias gariepinus (Butchell), Schilbe mystus (L.), Synodontis afrofischeri (Hilgend), Oreochromis variabilis (Boulenger), O. leucostictus (Trewavas), and Lates niloticus (L.), Micropterus salmoides (Lacepède) and L. niloticus are a new development in the river fishery introduced respectively from the highland areas and Lake Victoria. The yield in the river has been reduced from 668t in 1959 to the current 108t and species available replaced the once abundant Barbus altianalis (Boulenger) and Labeo victorianus (Boulenger). This drastic reduction in yield can be attributed to overfishing, habitat degradation and poor management. The upstream migration of the river fishes extends as far as 10km from the Lake Victoria river?mouth. The period of peak reproductive activity (March?June and October?November) coincides with the established rainy seasons in the region. The top ranking food items of the fishes are terrestrial and aquatic insects, vegetable matter, detritus, crustaceans, molluscs, fish, plankton and grit. The endemic fish stock appears to be in a depressed state, showing signs of overexploitation, and therefore careful stocking programmes to restore the fish balance would be appropriate. Fishing effort in the river should be regulated by licensing of nets and the minimum size of fish landed should be regulated through cooperative societies, clans, party elders and other social organizations.

,marketing strategy lessons from the mondragon agricultural cooperatives in spain,Hanna N.; Ridnour R.E.; Meadow H.L.,Journal of International Food and Agribusiness Marketing,8974438,4,3,11-23,1993,,,"The objective of this article is to examine the effects of the institutional setup on the time allocation of farmers. I investigate Israeli cooperative villages (Moshavim) that implement cooperative ideology differentially. Not working off the farm used to be part of that ideology. However, by 1981 most farm households had at least one adult member working off the farm. The fraction of off-farm workers varied considerably across cooperatives. Institutional structure can affect time-allocation decisions in several ways. First, there might be an explicit constraint or an implicit penalty on off-farm work. Second, stronger cooperatives (in the sense of having a more effective central management) may enhance the profitability of farming and, hence, indirectly induce members to work more on the farm and less off the farm. Both cooperative strength and ideological commitment are hypothesized to affect time allocation in the same way, namely, to reduce off-farm work and increase farm work. I test this hypothesis by examining the effects of cooperative attributes that proxy for these features on farmers' on-farm and off-farm labor-supply functions. This article emphasizes the effects of the institutional setup. Although it uses data on farm households in a relatively developed agricultural sector (Moshavim in Israel), the findings are perhaps more relevant to developing countries in which institutional constraints on the choices of farmers are more abundant. J. M. Guttman and N. Haruvi studied off-farm work participation rates in Moshavim and related them to the level of cooperation, using village-level variables. In contrast, in this study I explicitly model individual behavior and control for personal, family, and farm attributes. In addition, this article adds another dimension to the existing literature by estimating the off-farm labor-supply function jointly with the on-farm labor-supply function. This has been done before, mostly with respect to participation decisions. Since on-farm and off-farm labor supply are strongly negatively correlated, a joint estimation yields more efficient estimates. The institutional structure of Moshavim and its effect on time allocation are discussed in the following section. Next, I briefly review the theory of time allocation in farm households and discuss the comparative statics of the institutional structure. After that, I describe the data set, develop the empirical model, and report the estimation results. I find that in stronger and more ideologically committed cooperatives, farmers work less off the farm and more on the farm.

,the political economy in microcosm: the korean national livestock cooperatives federation,Steinberg D.I.,Korean Studies,0145840X,18,,158-170,1994,,,"This paper discusses the debate around structural adjustment and African agriculture, the history of the Tanzanian cotton sector and farming systems in the main cotton growing area of the country before reporting the results of a small survey of cultivators carried out at the end of the 1997/8 seed cotton marketing season. This survey, carried out in the fourth year of market liberalisation, covered crop sales, farming methods, marketing behaviour and perceptions of the marketing system. The survey's main findings were as follows: Firstly, while there was almost certainly a substantial production response in 1995/6 over 1994/5 (for both official production statistics and survey data reported here on shares of cultivated area under cotton in 1995/6 show a big increase on comparable material for 1994), there is no evidence that this response has been subsequently amplified as liberalisation has continued and as monetisation of cotton sales has been institutionalised. Neither official production statistics nor average shares of cultivated area under cotton or average cotton sales as reported here show an increase over the period 1995/6 to 1997/8. In fact they show a decline of production and sales in 1997/8. Secondly, while the decline in 1997/8 was mainly the result of adverse weather conditions, the underlying failure for production to grow is based on a failure to shift toward more optimal farming methods, and a significant decline in non-labour input use. The latter follows a monetisation of inputs supply. It remains to be seen if input use will also flatten out as this monetisation process becomes institutionalised. In any event, a recovery in input use seems unlikely. Thirdly, primary cooperative societies are currently retaining very sizeable seed cotton market shares, despite offering inferior prices to private traders' ones and despite having curtailed the supply of inputs on favourable terms. This is partly based on their retention of effective monopolies in certain geographical areas. But they are also surviving in areas of high competition on the basis of the loyalty of a segment of the peasantry. Their ability to retain market share seems likely to weaken as the years pass, since with credit-based input supply no longer being undertaken, loyalty will lose most of its rationale. In addition, cooperatives may experience falling purchases as a result of failures of liquidity and a further decline in price competitiveness. Fourthly, possession of land and cattle, areas under cotton cultivation, cotton sales volumes, membership of primary cooperative societies and marketing behaviour are all socially stratified along lines of oxen ownership/non-ownership. Social stratification is partly attenuated however, most notably as a result of the heterogeneous character of oxen owners as a group. The relationship between socio-economic stratification and some of the attributes discussed above is an interesting one. The group which is best off with regard to land and cattle, has the largest areas under cotton cultivation and the highest cotton sales volumes also has the highest membership of cooperatives and ostensibly the least commercially-oriented marketing behaviour. This pattern dates to the period when cooperatives were important providers of external resources and were thus subject to efforts by better-off groups to control them. Fifthly, little or no differentiation of farming methods according to the described pattern of social stratification could be detected. Apart from differences arising from the possession/non-possession of oxen themselves (i.e., concerning methods of land preparation) the rural upper strata farmed in more or less exactly the same way as the lower one. Liberalisation of marketing in Tanzanian agriculture has (re-) accelerated commodification but has not disturbed the essentially extensive forms it reverted to during the 1980s. This tendency in turn reflects not only the 'embeddedness' of certain farming systems, but - as will be explored in subsequent papers - deregulation of markets in forms which exclusively reward quantity of output and which systematically mitigate deficiencies in output quality.",,10.1353/ks.1994.0005,

In the two earlier periods, the plans followed the ideals and tastes of the ruling elites and the cities were built to meet their needs. But the cities were well adapted to the technologies of the times and patterns of social interactions among the residents. Consequently, they provided to most of their residents a living environment which was efficient, healthy and satisfying. One reason for this was that Delhi was a relatively small city and increase in population was slow. The half century since 1941 has witnessed an unprecedented increase in population which has gone up from less than 700,000 in 1941 to 8.4 million in 1991. The increase has been due partly in response to expansion of employment in public administration, trade, finance and manufacturing industries, and partly to large in-migration of displaced persons from Pakistan during 1947-48, and from other states of India throughout the period. The efforts of the public agencies - the Central Government and the Delhi Development Authority - to expand housing have been matched by those of individuals and cooperative societies. But the efforts have been focussed on providing housing to people of medium and high income groups; the housing needs of the poor have been met by rapid growth of slums and unauthorised colonies. Expansion of physical and social infrastructure has also proved inadequate to meet the demands on it. The reliance in the absence of a mass transit facility, on a miscellany of motor vehicles for movement within the city, has resulted in very high levels of air and noise pollution. The hopeful beginning with long-term planning, made with successful implementation of the first master plan 1961-81, has suffered a set back as a result of the failure of the Central Government to approve the second master plan 1981-2001.

This paper analyzes how differences in incentive structure constrain the attractiveness of interest-rate speculation and other risk-taking opportunities to managers and regulators of credit unions. Despite these better incentives, robust present-value calculations establish that NCUSIF fell into economic insolvency during the mid-1980s. Besides calculating the extent of this insolvency, the paper also seeks to explain why, after NCUSIF became insolvent, it could rebuild its reserves without an explicit or implicit taxpayer bailout. Our explanation turns on cross-industry coinsurance responsibilities and the shallowness of the fund's observed insolvency relative to industry net worth. We identify forces in the decisionmaking environment tending to limit the depth and duration of unresolved insolvencies at individual credit unions. Managerial opportunities to benefit personally from taking risks that would flow through to NCUSIF are constrained by difficulties in converting a credit union to stockholder form and by the intensity of proactive monitoring of troubled credit unions by sister institutions and other private coinsurers.

It could have assisted private cooperatives by providing antitrust exemptions, market information, and enforcement of cooperative rules or intervened directly with mandatory output reductions and targeted prices. The policies adopted were influenced by crop-specific characteristics and broader market conditions affecting the success of private cooperatives. © 1991, The Economic History Association.

Lele's analysis of cooperative ""failure' is discussed in relation to its public choice theory framework - one which is flawed when trying to understand local forms of public action. The SANASA Thrift and Credit Cooperative Societies in Sri Lanka provide empirical evidence to support the counter-argument. Since the late 1970s, SANASA's geographical spread and membership has increased dramatically. The cooperative network is one of the largest sources of rural financial services in the country. Based on fieldwork and a survey of members, data is presented to show how the Thrift and Credit Cooperatives have brought real benefits to poorer members. Significant numbers of borrowers have achieved increased incomes linked to their use of credit, and there is evidence of some graduation above the poverty line. SANASA cooperatives are notable because they have not, generally, been ""captured' by local elites wishing to use them for their own interests. SANASA illustrates how purely self-interested behaviour is not axiomatic, and that there are conditions in which local forms of collective action emerge and can be sustained. The study shows the weakness in public choice theory becuse of its failure to incorporate the role of leaders as a factor in its analytical framework. In conclusion, the argument suggests that cooperatives merit renewed consideration as an organisational form which can, in some contexts, play a poverty-alleviation role. -from Authors",,10.1007/BF02911340,
,potential for cooperative involvement in vertical coordination and value-added activities,Royer J.S.,Agribusiness,7424477,11,5,473-481,1995,,,"The premise of this paper is that the strong trends toward ever increasing centralization in the agricultural producing sector of the United States in the 1980s will exacerbate in the middle-to-late 1990s. This, in turn, will lead to both radical changes in the consumer movement by the year 2000, and also to a completely redefined mission for the corporate marketing function as well. Specifically, the deliberate federal policies of the 1980s which led to a ""shake-out"" of the small family farm units in favor of large agri-business concerns in order to reduce federal subsidies will lead, in the 1990s, to the most noted of deleterious consequences of monopolization, namely ever increasing prices and lowered quality. The authors believe that by the late 1990s the American public will perceive this state of affairs as being intolerable and it will lead them to organize ""Big Consumerism"", a cohesive, much strengthened version of the consumer movement of the 1980s. This movement will, among other major activities, establish consumer cooperatives as a way to control costs through the elimination of unnecessary middlemen. In addition, this new consumerism will demand a change in the ethical standards of business behavior which, in turn, will result in a reformation in the role of the ""New Marketer"". This ""New Marketer"" function will be envisioned and practiced by incumbents as informational and educational, adhering to the highest standards of truthfulness concerning the products they are attempting to market. In this regard, the role of governmental agencies will be greatly strengthened and expanded to insure that the marketing profession lives up to these highest ethical standards and practices. © 1993 Iona College.",,10.1002/1520-6297(199509/10)11:5<473::AID-AGR2720110510>3.0.CO;2-W,

,the cooperative movement in nicaragua: empowerment and accompaniment of severely disadvantaged peasants,Kroeker C.J.,Journal of Social Issues,224537,52,1,123-138,1996,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,,"Horace Plunkett?s Irish cooperative association introduced credit cooperatives into Ireland in 1894. The Irish cooperatives were modeled on the very successful Raiffeisen credit cooperatives of rural Germany. Credit cooperatives were never successful in Ireland, in contrast to other branches of Irish cooperation. Irish bankers argued that credit cooperatives failed simply because there was no need for such an institution. Several observers, including parliamentary bodies, came to the opposite conclusion: credit was expensive for smallholders, and credit cooperatives were a potential solution to the problem. This essay argues that several features of the Irish economic and social environment undermined the cooperative?s operation. The Irish credit cooperatives never attracted as members the more prosperous locals who provided crucial monitoring and expertise in Germany. The Irish cooperative movement was also never able to develop the strong central auditing federations that supervised and certified German cooperatives. Finally, rural Irish people seemed reluctant to force their neighbors to repay loans or face adverse consequences, which undermined the monitoring and enforcement advantages that cooperatives potentially have over commercial banks. This episode illustrates both the importance of timing in institutional development and the difficulty of transplanting institutions from one social and economic context to another. © 1994 Academic Press.

The coops and the broader national coop movement are shown to be empowering of the participants. However, while some factors enhanced the possibility of empowerment, other complex interrelated factors impeded its development. Autocratic leadership was prevalent, intermingled with apprehension about leadership and fears of failure.

Much of the knowledge gained from that evolution should be applicable to the developing world. Yet, one must be careful not to try to apply the Finnish model directly to developing countries that have different cultural backgrounds, government constitutions, and economic and social obligations. The Finnish experience shows that development is based on consumers' initiative. Each party should assume the duties that exist. Consumers should pay or otherwise cover the main part of the costs. The government should concentrate on policy issues, promotion, and guidance, Associations should have management responsibility, where the role of the key person, the champion/prime-mover is decisive, The private sector could supply many of the external services. External support agencies and developing countries should analyse the experiences and potential of water associations in their areas.

Flood prevention cooperatives organized by inhabitants in frequently-inundated areas have played an important role in bearing the expenses allotted to localities. But some of the cooperatives could not bear their share of the expenses and flood control work failed consequently. The author analyzed the causes of failure of a flood prevention cooperative in sharing expenses and clarified the problems of local share in expenses taking the case of the Kokufu River Flood Prevention Cooperative on Sado Island. The results are as follows: The most decisive reason that the Kokufu River Flood Prevention Cooperative could not bear its allotment is the impossibility of payment by the inhabitants of the upper basin, because extremely high rates of allotment in the upper basin were decided without adjusting the conflict between upper basin residents and lower basin residents. Hence prefectural river improvement work of the Kokufu River was halfed. Futhermore the following situation contributed to default in payment. In the Kokufu River basin advanced mining techniques were applied to flood control works in the Edo Period, and these works were carried out several times in connection with the prosperity and decline of the Sado Gold Mine. Some rational features in the works, imposition and repayment system, and so on can be seen. But after the Meiji Restoration small land-ownership in the island society prescribed repayment of much of the expenses of river improvement, and work was stopped. Therefore consideration must be given to relative flood damage between the upper basin and lower basin so as not to produce outstanding inequality between the two districts when making allotment rates. Generally, in frequently-inundated areas, we can see conflict between the uper basin and lower basin. But in that case flood control work cannot be realized without adjustment of advantages and disadvantages between the two districts. Also realization of flood control work requires the intervention of the prefectural goverment with large funds. © 1992, The Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan, Inc.

As for study areas, four areas were selected: the Tajima area in Hyogo and Fuji area in Shizuoka were chosen as the production areas located in the environs of metropolitan regions. While the Koyu area in Miyazaki and the northern area of Iwate were selected as case studies in the periphery. General conditions found in the study for the formation of production area in the broiler chicken industry are as follows. The first is the participation of business firms and agricultural cooperatives groups as an integrator in the industry, setting up processing factories through which they developed competition to secure broiler chicken raising farms. Consequently, expanding the production area spatially, the farms gradually enlarged their sizes to carry out specialized management. The second is the predominance of marginal farms on the less favored areas where the integrators moved. These marginal farms which did not have much alternative were willing to raise broiler chickens, expecting larger incomes and stable farm management. The third is the special attributes of the broiler chicken industry such as a relatively small initial investment, and the simplicity of chicken raising which enables easy participation for even an unexperienced farm household, and an assurance of relatively high income. © 1991, The Association of Japanese Geographers.

Prior to colonial rule, amongst various institutional models being tried in India and elsewhere for sustainable management of natural resources, the tree growers' cooperatives promoted by the National tree Growers' Cooperative Federation Limited are one which are founded on democratic norms and are progressing towards self reliance and sustainability. The Tree Growers' Cooperatives Project is currently under implementation in six states of the country with the assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA). the Federation is trying to re-establish peoples' institutions in the form of cooperatives for natural resource management in a decentralised manner. The Tree growers' Cooperatives organised under the project acquire 30-40 ha of highly degraded compact patches of revenue wastelands on long lease in closer proximity of small/medium size villages in eco-fragile regions and trans-form it into a biodiversity rich resource over a period of 8-10 yr. The results so far have proved the capacity of the rural people in establishing and managing the Tree Growers' Cooperatives, developing norms for regeneration, protection and sustainable utilisation of biomass from the village commons. the members of the cooperatives have also demonstrated their cost effective managerial capacity, innovative ideas in dispute resolution, benefit sharing and techniques of soil and water conservation and plant protection.

With past eight years of experience, emphasis is now being laid on holistic resource management, participatory planning, monitoring and evaluation and awareness for matching resources with human and livestock population.

On the other hand it is seen in the same district that the oldmen and women specialize in growing the vegetables without the help of younger men. This cannot be adequately expanded from the available statistical data. The author attended to analyse horticulture districts which have various vegetable growers, and so selected Kitano-cho, Fukuoka Prefecture as a research field. The findings about the vegetable growing groups are as follows: There are 3 types of vegetable growing farms formed from mainly farming-labor family members: (1) The vegetable growers who manage the plastic green houses under fixed structures. They employ usually women, and sell the vegetables to chiefly the agricultural cooperative. (2) The full-time farm households (except above (1) type farms) consisting of young or middle-aged men, lacking fixed green houses. (3) The powerless labor group which consists of oldmen and women. This group's farmhouses sell the vegetables to merchants instead of the agricultural cooperative. In spite of being a small district, Kitano-cho has a large vegetable output which we can measure in the statistical data. Kitano-cho stands in the fertile alluvial plain on the Chikugo River. The common explanation for the large vegetable output comes on the good soil conditions of Kitano-cho. The author points out that Kitano-cho owes the recent development of vegetable production to many employed women. They work to make up the reaped vegetables to finished products by sorting out, putting in order, packing into boxes. Most of them are 40?60 year-old housewives whose husbands work the offices or factories. As a result, we can interpret of the employed women promoting to increase the agricultural earnings in whole Kitano-cho town. But, the author emphasizes: there may be a hidden distinction between the two sexes in the lower wages for the employed women. Though the Japanese law prohibits to make the sexual distinction any working condition, not all the women can easily find work on favorable terms. © 1995, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

The findings are supplemented by information from preliminary research by the author on a number of other cooperatives in which women were involved and from secondary sources. The research indicates that producer cooperatives for women can be successful if there are even a few women with the necessary skills and time required. Many cooperatives studied failed in part because of lack of enthusiasm of the women involved, indicating the problems the promotion of producer cooperatives involves. The paper argues that a far more wide?ranging debate is needed about the ways in which the ideals of cooperation and empowerment can be preserved, while at the same time responding to the context in which cooperatives have to operate. There is no ideal cooperative but a range of possible options. The varying needs of women require a participatory transformation of both state and NGO cooperative development agencies.

Cooperatives would seem vulnerable to liquidity problems caused by correlated shocks to their member's fortunes. They would also seem vulnerable to fraud and mis-management and to have problems convincing the public they were safe places to invest money. The historical record shows, however, that the cooperatives overcame these problems, growing steadily in numbers and assets. The minimal government regulation to which the cooperatives were subject did little to overcome their potential weaknesses. Rather, the cooperatives devised a series of regional banks and auditing associations to which most cooperatives eventually belonged. Regional cooperative banks provided liquidity and emergency loans to member cooperatives, obviating some disadvantages of their small size. Auditing associations monitored member cooperatives and provided confidence to the public by ensuring adherence to basic standards. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.",,10.1080/00219266.1992.9655269,Integrated; Management; Pest

Attention is drawn to a middle way between highly efficient practices using pesticides and less efficient, smaller scale organic farming systems. One such intermediate scheme is Integrated Pest Management (IPM); its origin, development and application are outlined and key components of any IPM scheme summarized.

,"profitability of credit unions, commercial banks and savings banks: a comparative analysis",Kaushik S.K.; Lopez R.H.,American Economist,5694345,40,1,66-78,1996,SAGE Publications Inc.,,"Cooperative organizational forms such as franchising and joint venturing have long been popularamong hospitality chains. However, not all chains use cooperative organizational forms and those that do varygreatlyin theirproclivityto use them. One possible explanation for this variation is that when a chain confronts critical resource scarcities, its managers will use cooperative organization in order to build upon the resources of their partners. However a second approach, agency theory, suggests that chain managers use cooperative organization to minimize the costs of monitor ing outlet managers. Using data on 94 restaurant chains, hypotheses are tested that investigate the independent and joint efficacy of these explanations. Results show that capital and brand name are important resources affecting the choice of organizational form whereas geographic dispersion, task programmability, and asset specificity are key agency variables. Overall, perhaps the key finding is that the ability of agency theory to explain organizational form is diminished among resource scarce chains. The results, therefore, suggest that both perspectives are needed to fully explain the choice of organizational form. © 1997 THE COUNCIL ON HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND INSTITUTIONAL EDUCATION.",,10.1177/056943459604000109,

Credit unions, although only one-twelfth their size, are at least as profitable as commercial banks and savings banks. The savings banking industry has maintained its competitive profitability as the industry has shrunk in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Credit union loan portfolios have grown more rapidly than either commercial banks' or savings institutions. Their net interest margins have been above the banks' in recent years. Growth in the equity capital accounts of credit unions has been consistently more than double that of commercial banks since 1985, giving them a substantial advantage with regard to overall safety and soundness compared with commercial and savings banks. © 1996 Omicron Delta Epsilon.",,,

The CAMPCO's headquarter is situated in Mangalore and it has the mandate to reduce fluctuations in arecanut prices and create a market condition which ensures remunerative price for the growers. Its main activities include procurement, sale and processing of arecanut and cocoa, advancement of loan and essential inputs to the members, regulation of arecanut trade and promotion of research in production, processing and marketing of arecanut. The presence and performance of a marketing co-operative like CAMPCO could exercise 'intervention effects' of various forms on the structure, conduct and performance of the marketing system. The paper makes an attempt to analyse the impacts of the CAMPCO Ltd. on the structure of arecanut market and on the growth and stability in the prices of arecanut in Karnataka. Market structure is interpreted to mean all those characteristics of the organisation of the market that seem to influence the composition, competitiveness and nature of pricing within the market. The structure of the market was studied indirectly through the behaviour of arrivals, prices, concentration and so on.",,,

Given the present credit market, in which certain categories of borrowers either cannot purchase credit or can only do so on disadvantageous terms, then the importance of such an alternative only increases. The credit union is such a device. It has an established and proven record of success in many countries but, outside of Northern Ireland, credit unions are in their infancy in the United Kingdom. This article examines the possibilities credit unions afford, against the background of the increasing problem of debt in the United Kingdom. We contend that credit unions can afford a partial solution to the debt problem, but that attention should also be placed on their limitations. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,10.1002/pad.4230110504,
,communal forest management: the honduran resin tappers,Stanley D.L.,Development and Change,0012155X,22,4,757-779,1991,,,"This paper examines the functioning and performance of a large cooperative federation in Nicaragua, concerned mainly with retailing. Set up in late 1985, in response to undersupply to smallholders, especially those in the mountainous interior, it has followed a strategy of rapid expansion. By using a federal structure which has allowed middle and junior management freedom to take the initiative, and by adopting mostly simple, appropriate, and non?bureaucratic procedures, the federation has succeeded in mounting an impressively large operation, with over 190 shops selling a wide variety of goods. On the other hand, at the centre, sales have grown sluggishly since 1988, costs have risen, and liquidity has become a problem. Moreover, the organization has lost capital, largely through its pricing policy. These can be blamed partly on the federated structure, the lack of a medium?term strategy, and dependency upon external donors; and partly on the trading environment of recession and uncertainty. The case study illustrates the difficulties in establishing large?scale cooperative enterprise, and the need in the long run to realise comparative advantage.

While many analyses have blamed the tragedy of the commons and government mismanagement for environmental destruction, this paper provides a case study of resin tapping in Honduras which formulates the hypotheses that common property regimes can be successful and that economic liberalization policies may be detrimental to community?level resource schemes. Over half of the 6000 farmer?resin tappers in Honduras are organized into forty?six co?operatives that market the tree sap, wood and other forest products. These activities combine the twin goals of community?based forest preservation and income generation. Established legally in 1974, the tapping groups have expanded to include a variety of organizational and technical arrangements. The two co?operatives of Villa Santa and San Juan de Ojojona demonstrate contrasting histories, ecological endowments and economic outcomes. Currently the Honduran resin tappers are facing problems over their access to forest resources, the fluctuating profitability of extractive activities and the stability of the co?operative organization. These three issues are relevant to a variety of community?based environmental activities, and the lessons of the Honduran experience can be applied to analyse the processes of environmental degradation and community response elsewhere in the Third World. © 1991 Institute of Social Studies",,10.1016/0024-6301(90)90205-I,

It provides an overview of credit unions within the U.S. financial services industry, and the result of a recent study of 283 such institutions. Results indicate that the propensity to plan is related to key organizational processes, structural configurations, administrative procedures, managerial perceptions of environmental predictability, and multiple performance measures. It was found that formal planning has different roles among various types of organizations and that managers should bear this in mind as they engage in planning processes within non-profit institutions. The results also suggest that formal planning facilitates communication between management and the board, directs the organization to focus on critical success factors, and results in superior performance along important criteria. © 1990.",,,

The growing agribusiness competition is stimulating debate about the compatibility between the historical principles of cooperative principles and the economic efficiency requested for their survival. The need to achieve high quality economic performance brings about cooperative organizational patterns characterized by staff control over members, who progressively lose their autonomy of decision. The acceptance of this model is determined by two reasons: the interest in members for cooperative organizations capable of assuring them consistent returns with the development of agri-business activities; and the need to eliminate the inefficiencies created by the competition between Catholic and Communist cooperatives. The present economic crisis of many right and left cooperatives is the result of the ideological division that has influenced the cooperatives in the past and gradually drove them to be heavily dependent on political parties. -from Author",,10.1111/j.1465-7295.1991.tb00856.x,

Unrestricted voting, however, can lead to unstable decision making. We find that firms make tradeoffs among collective decision making, production scale, firm structure, and voter characteristics that are consistent with efforts to economize on the costs of voting. Firm responses include agenda control, restrictions to obtain a homogeneous voting population, and limits on firm size. We consider three long?surviving producer cooperatives, representing extreme cases of collective decision making, and find that their organization is sensitive to the costs of voting and to the employment of mechanisms to constrain those costs.

,diagnosis and implementation: how a large cooperative employed a series of proposals for restructuring based upon the viable systems model,Walker J.,Systems Practice,15739295,3,5,441-451,1990,Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers,,"The failure of forestry to contribute to poverty reduction in Central America is due to public policies which inhibit its profitability. Absence of public regulation of harvesting and competing subsidies to agriculture keep forestry stumpage prices artificially low. This encourages destruction of the forest resource, which damages both the environment and the potential to reduce poverty. A comparison of Costa Rica and Honduras reveals two dissimilar approaches toward forest policy. While Costa Rica attempts to raise producer and grower stumpage prices by tax credits, soft loans and differential species fees, Honduras enforces price ceilings and uses centralized authority to control forest production and export. Both countries exhibit weaknesses in the management control cycle of programming, budgeting, implementing and evaluating their forest policies. Yet the Costa Rican approach has increased stumpage prices already, which bodes well for their forest sector. By contrast, the major beneficiary of Honduran forest policy has been COHDEFOR, the state enterprise responsible for forestry management, controlling production, and running its national system of agroforestry cooperatives. Despite greater public authority and resources than the Costa Rican forest service (DGF), the Honduran forest policy is not likely to increase producer profitability or reduce poverty in the near future.

A logistic pattern of cooperative growth is tested and found to dominate a view that the number of coops grows because of support organizations. Drawing upon an ecological model it is suggested that the factor which limits growth is the availability of management and, further, that the growth of the competing 'small-scale sector' is at the expense of the cooperative sector. Management nurtured in the cooperative sector moves into the small-scale sector. Case-study analysis using a Boolean analysis suggests that legitimate and capable management are essential to success of cooperatives particularly with technologies which generate production interdependencies. Finally, supporting evidence for the significance of management competence and interdependence in explaining performance is outlined using an augmented CobbDouglas production function framework. © 1990, Sage Publications.

These include: lack of membership's identity with co-operatives; lack of understanding on the part of members of the co-operative way of doing things; failure of co-operatives to compete with other businesses; inability of members to dismiss inefficient management; failure of co-operatives to provide transportation; inability of co-operatives to keep adequate stocks of requisites; insufficient credit; and the subsistence nature of agriculture.

As a political good its significance is unrivalled: rice policy has critical consequences for farm incomes, government largesse to the agricultural cooperatives and fanners support for the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

In 1986, rice joined the list of agricultural commodities targeted by the United States for market access; it is now one of the key items subject to agricultural trade negotiations in the GATT Uruguay Round. One of the most serious and urgent policy questions facing the Japanese administration is whether to maintain the ban on rice imports or introduce some form of partial or total liberalization of the rice market. This paper examines the forces arrayed on each side of the rice liberalization debate in Japan and ventures a prediction about the final outcome.

,,,,,,,,,,,"Lending groups and credit cooperatives have the potential to provide affordable credit to small-scale farmers because they can reduce transaction costs and lower the risk of default. In developing countries these two kinds of lending arrangements have a mixed record, although their difficulties reflect shortcomings in implementation rather than in the lending arrangements themselves.The article indicates that successful group lending schemes work well with groups that are homogeneous and jointly liable for defaults. The practice of denying credit to all group members in case of default is the most effective and least costly way of enforcing joint liability. Another way to encourage members to repay is to require mandatory deposits that are reimbursed only when all borrowers repay their loans.The article points out that credit cooperatives that mobilize savings deposits are less dependent on external sources and increase the borrowers' incentive to repay. The success of credit cooperatives requires training of members as well as management. Experience suggests that credit cooperatives should not expand their activities beyond financial intermediation until they develop strong institutional and managerial capabilities. © 1990 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.",,,
