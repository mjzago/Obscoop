Specifically, we seek to determine if farmers see cooperative-like organizations as a means of reducing risk or as a way of accessing riskier opportunities. Using data from a risk experiment involving 348 apple farmers, we estimate risk attitudes and correlate those indicators with participation in Farm Bases and other controls. In the case of Chinese apple producers, we find that considerations of risk are an important feature of organizational forms that involve collective decision-making, although the correlation between risk and cooperative organizational participation is nuanced.","[Jin, Shaoze] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Hannover, Germany; [Jia, Xiangping] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [James, Harvey S.] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Leibniz University Hannover; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agriculture Information Institute, CAAS; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia","James, HS (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",hjames@missouri.edu,"James, Harvey/V-4021-2019","James, Harvey/0000-0003-0189-271X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573209, 71661147001]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0201303]; National Social Science Foundation [16ZDA021]; United States Department of Agriculture Hatch [MO-AC011AC047]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Social Science Foundation; United States Department of Agriculture Hatch(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 71573209, 71661147001; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFD0201303; National Social Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 16ZDA021; United States Department of Agriculture Hatch, Grant/Award Number: MO-AC011AC047",,65,3,3,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Many co-operatives have been converted into the so-called hybrid co-operatives, owned together with external financiers. This article applies governance cost theory to explain this development. The results show that members are not able to govern a collectively owned firm that is large and complex; members are thus reluctant to invest in co-operatives; and members do not perceive that co-operatives benefit them economically. Thus, strong leaders take control and non-member investors gain ownership and influence.","[Nilsson, Jerker] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Nilsson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, POB 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",jerker.nilsson@slu.se,,,,,,,41,12,13,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,JUN,2018,47,2,,,,,87,92,,10.1177/0030727018761175,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0030727018761175,,,6,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,GM9VN,,Green Accepted,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000438603200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper contributes to this task by focusing on the governance of agricultural cooperatives whose members often have heterogeneous preferences. The key novel idea is to conceptualize cooperative governance in the light of the proposed distinction between the core and peripheral activities of cooperatives. While core activities are based on members' truly common interests, peripheral activities include all else. This approach allows tracing governance challenges of agricultural co-operatives back to the inflation of peripheral activities. Based on this approach, cooperative managers and members are advised to minimize these activities and to draw clear boundaries between core and periphery.","[Iliopoulos, Constantine; Valentinov, Vladislav] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Economies IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Iliopoulos, Constantine] Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Athens, Greece",,"Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Economies IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.;Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Athens, Greece.",iliopoulosC@agreri.gr; Valentinov@iamo.de,"Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Iliopoulos, Constantine/F-9617-2014","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; , IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Iliopoulos, Constantine/0000-0002-1770-8270",,,,,107,6,6,5,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0956-5221,1873-3387,,SCAND J MANAG,Scand.

In witnessing these structural changes, scholars have proffered analyses of nontraditional ownership models focusing on residual claim rights. However, crucial information on the allocation of control rights in cooperatives is missing. This study sheds light on alternative ownership-control models adopted by agricultural cooperatives in different regions across the world. In each of these models, we describe the allocation of formal control rights with a focus on decision management and decision control rights. We thus provide empirical evidence on the separation of ownership and control in agricultural cooperatives. We also analyze each of the governance models in terms of the associated ownership costs, including risk-bearing costs, the costs of controlling managers, and collective decision-making costs. In doing so, we are able to better understand the forces influencing the organizational efficiency of each cooperative model. [EconLit classification: Q130].

First, 25 factors that influence the process of generational succession, called decision-making factors, were identified through a literature review and dialogue with the cooperatives. Then, using the methodology adapted from Slack, Chambers and Johnston (2007), a sample of 308 young people between 18 and 30 years old eval-uated the level of importance and performance of the decision-making factors indicated. In the respondents' opinion, none of the 25 factors performed better than their importance, as all factors present the possibility of improvement. However, according to the evaluation methodology used in this paper, 20 factors (property size; access to technologies; access to media and information; labor availability; diversification of agricultural ac-tivities; income provided by agricultural activities; access to education; social interaction and number of people in the community; professional expectations; remuneration received by the youth; education; type of work performed; marriage; autonomy; family dialogue; encouragement and recognition; technical assistance; presence of the cooperative, union, and associations; and access to marketing) performed adequately and did not require improvements in any of the three cooperatives. On the other hand, five factors need improvement: leisure infrastructure; road infrastructure; social valorization; rural credit and public policies; and price, according to the grain cooperative; leisure infrastructure, road infrastructure, social valorization; and price, according to the dairy cooperative; and social valorization and price, according to meat cooperative. We concluded that a significant part of the factors (80 %) performed in an adequate way directly or indirectly in the three cooperatives. The youth of the three cooperatives indicated social valorization and price among the factors that need improvement. Thus, we highlight that agricultural cooperatives should seek to understand their role in the face of decision -making factors that need improvement and seek to improve them.","[Lago, Adriano] Fed Univ Santa UFSM, Dept Adm, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Lago, Adriano] Fed Univ Santa UFSM, Grad Program Agribusiness, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Amorim, Gabrieli dos Santos] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Agribusiness, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Boscardin, Mariele] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Postgrad Program Rural Extens UFSM, Rural Dev, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Zucatto, Luis Carlos] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Adm, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Zucatto, Luis Carlos; Spanevello, Rosani Marisa] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Postgrad Program Agribusiness, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Spanevello, Rosani Marisa] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Zootech & Biol Sci, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Lago, A (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa UFSM, Dept Adm, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;Lago, A (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa UFSM, Grad Program Agribusiness, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",adrianolago@yahoo.com.br; gabrieliamorim@hotmail.com; marieleboscardin@hotmail.com; luiszucatto@gmail.com; rspanevello@yahoo.com.br,,,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ); National Cooperative Learning Service (SES-COOP),National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); National Cooperative Learning Service (SES-COOP),"To the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ) and to the National Cooperative Learning Service (SES-COOP) , sponsors of the research.",,54,0,0,6,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

However, whether all farmers benefit from a PO is still a question. Limited evidence is available on whether POs are inclusive of poor farmers. Even if the poor join, do they participate in decision-making? We conducted interviews with 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya. We distinguish three groups; members of a bargaining PO, members of a processing PO and non-members. We show that membership is related to the structural characteristics of the organization: processing POs favor membership of farmers that are wealthier, more educated and more innovative. As to participation in the decision-making process: older, male and specialized farmers have a higher chance of being involved than poor farmers.

We find that a bargaining PO is more inclusive of all groups of farmers, while women and poor farmers are excluded from decision-making in a processing PO.

Probability distributions of milk price and yield are derived to expose business and financial risk faced by dairy farmers. After designing appropriate dairy risk management strategies, existing risk management strategies were compared by using second-degree stochastic dominance (SSD). The results show that the total risk of dairy farmers is 57 % and the possible loss is approximately 2000$. Business risk is 50 % while the other half is attributed to financial rigidities. Research results also suggest that the most appropriate risk management strategy is transferring risk in order to ensure sufficient returns to meet debt services and to operate expense commitments in the research area. Based on the SSD results, income diversification through obtaining off farm income is the best way to transfer risk and marketing milk through sales cooperatives is the following alternative for dairy farmers.","Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-55139 Kurupelit, Turkey",Ondokuz Mayis University,"Ceyhan, V (corresponding author), Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-55139 Kurupelit, Turkey.",vceyhan@omu.edu.tr,"Ceyhan, Vedat/GSD-4295-2022",,,,,,16,3,3,0,2,W U V-UNIVERSITATSVERLAG- VIENNA UNIV PRESS,VIENNA,"BERGGASSE 5, A-1090 VIENNA, AUSTRIA",0006-5471,,,BODENKULTUR,Bodenkultur,MAY,2004,54,4,,,,,215,220,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,829QU,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000222065500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has three specific objectives. First, it seeks to identify how members participate in these agricultural cooperatives' decisions. Second, with the goal of helping cooperatives to develop solutions, it verifies the types of difficulties encountered in the current configuration of markets that cooperatives are placed in. Third, it identifies actions to minimize the managerial problems of agricultural cooperatives. This work is based on a multicase study on 10 agricultural cooperatives in the state, whose managers were interviewed in a semi-structured way in 2016. The results showed that the main problems encountered in the management of these organizations are as follows. a) Cooperatives compete with other companies in the sector, and they must be competitive while being faithful to the cooperative principles. b) The team responsible for the cooperatives' management finds it difficult to compete in oligopolized markets. c) Cooperative members' participation in management is low. d) Cooperatives' associates and members exhibit opportunistic behaviors.

The empirical investigation is motivated by the dearth of empirical literature on agricultural cooperatives' performance measurement and its correlates. Design/methodology/approach The study employed DEA and applied the input minimisation constraint. The authors used the data from 19 agricultural cooperatives which had complied with reporting on their annual financial statements (AFS) in the financial year 2014/2015. The input variables were total assets and total expenses, and the output variables were revenue and profit. Findings The average technical efficiency was found to be 72 per cent efficient indicating the presence of 28 per cent resource wastages. Of the 19 decision-making units, only 5 (26 per cent) were 100 per cent efficient. It should be noted that the 26 per cent that were technically efficient were also operating at constant returns to scale (optimal resource allocation). Originality/value The study was necessitated by the continued focus on government based on the cooperatives, as there is a dearth of empirical literature separating managers' reports and empirically proven studies/results.","[Xaba, Sharon Thembi; Mathur-Helm, Babita] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ & Management Sci, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Marwa, Nyankomo] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Business Management, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"Xaba, ST (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ & Management Sci, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",thembix@gmail.com; nyankomo@sun.ac.za; babita@sun.ac.za,,"Xaba, Sharon Thembi/0000-0001-8361-5315",,,,,69,3,3,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2040-0705,2040-0713,,AFR J ECON MANAG STU,Afr.

However, there is limited focus on enhancing the voluntary use of organic fertilisers by small farmers who have joined an agricultural cooperative. This paper describes an agent-based model for simulating small farmers' decision-making with regard to fertiliser selection. Ninety six farmers (members) of one of the largest strawberry production cooperatives in China were assessed to understand their willingness to use different fertilisers and their socioeconomic characteristics. Simulation results showed that for farmers belonging to the agricultural cooperative who earn higher marginal profits, variations in the prices of the agricultural produce had no significant effect on their behaviour in terms of the use of organic fertilisers. The number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year has a positive relationship with the increase in the rate at which farmers use organic fertilisers. However, the count does not alter the final number of farmers who use organic fertilisers after several years. Moreover, farmers' willingness to use organic fertilisers enhances the increasing speed and final number of farmers using organic fertilisers simultaneously. The design of strategies (increasing the number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year and enhancing farmers' willingness to use organic fertilisers) has a significant effect on the promotion of organic fertiliser application by agricultural cooperatives in China.","[Li, Jing; Wan, Shan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Sch Informat Management, Pox 8, Nanjing 210031, Peoples R China; [He, Ruiyin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Sch Engn, Nanjing 210031, Peoples R China; [deVoil, Peter] Univ Queensland, Ctr Crop Sci, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat QAAFI, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Queensland,"Li, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Sch Informat Management, Pox 8, Nanjing 210031, Peoples R China.",phdlijing@njau.edu.cn; ryhe@njau.edu.cn; p.devoil@uq.edu.au; shanwan@njau.edu.cn,,"LI, Jing/0000-0003-2002-4512",Humanities and Social Science Fund of MOE (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China) [18YJC630070],Humanities and Social Science Fund of MOE (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China),Elsevier Language Editing Services provided language help for this paper.

Following El Salvador's turn to the left, Salvadoran agrarian reform cooperatives and civil society allies began to allocate organizational resources toward writing public policy measures to incorporate agroecology under the FMLN government's agricultural social program, the Family Agriculture Plan (PAF). While the cooperative sector took part in active negotiations with the FMLN party for the institutionalization of favorable policies, the former guerrilla party formulized strategies for gaining a multiclass electorate in order to remain in power. With the intention to better understand the attitude and distinct Salvadoran actors, we utilize an anthropology of public policy framework to indicate how expectations of political party legitimacy failed to shape the institutionalization of agroecology in El Salvador. We suggest that the pursuit of agroecological policies is a balancing act of making use of the State to strengthen on the ground efforts without forging organizational disarticulation following changes in government administrations.","Colegio Frontera Sur, San Cristobal de las Casa, Chiapas, Mexico; Ctr Invest Multidisciplinaria Chiapas & Frontera, San Cristobal de las Casa, Mexico",El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR),"Giraldo, OF (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur Ecosur, San Cristobal de las Casa, Mexico.",ogiraldo@ecosur.mx,"Giraldo, Omar Felipe/HZK-1346-2023; Mier y Terán Giménez Cacho, Mateo/GQI-3459-2022","Giraldo, Omar Felipe/0000-0002-3485-5694; Murguia Gonzalez, Adriana/0000-0003-1149-3544",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),This work was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia.,,46,1,1,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2168-3565,2168-3573,,AGROECOL SUST FOOD,Agroecol.

Many cooperatives try to adapt to novel consumer demands by engaging more in product development, with the aim of manufacturing and selling more differentiated products. The article discusses which governance problems that are likely to unfold as cooperatives engage more in the development, production and sales of differentiated end-products. The idea to be advanced is that the nature of the governance problems is contingent on where in the cooperative's production chain the main sources of uniqueness and product differentiation have their origin. When the uniqueness of the end-product is created at the raw-commodity level (on-farm), haggling over appropriable quasi-rent between members and the cooperative is likely to emerge, leading to a hold-up situation. When the uniqueness of the differentiated end-product is created at the cooperative level, the cooperative community is likely to be exposed to consequential incentive problems related to motivation and control.

Horizontal communication (HC) is characterized as the exchange of information between farmers in the society of members. It is associated with process innovation. Vertical communication (VC) is the exchange of information between a member and the CEO of the cooperative enterprise. It is associated with product innovation. The CEO decides regarding the deliveries of the member and the level of vertical communication in the centralized cooperative, while these decisions are taken by the members in the decentralized cooperative.

The decision-making process nevertheless remains the same: they use statistical voting system to accept (or refuse) individual items. In standard situation of limited financial resources they have to create preference lists of individual items. This paper deals with mathematical properties of such preference lists and their comparison to statistical voting. If a board is to decide between two alternatives a and b, usually the majority rule procedure is applied and the alternative with the most votes is declared a winner. From mathematical point of view the majority rule properties were formulated by May (1952), who showed that if the number of board members is odd and each election procedure produces a unique winning item then the majority rule is the only so called social choice procedure for two alternatives that satisfies the following three conditions: it treats all the board members the same, it treats both alternatives the same and it is monotone. Nevertheless, if there are more than two possible choices, the situation is completely different. The inner structure of the problem is very rich and needs more detailed research. The situation is demonstrated on voting for investment items of the agricultural marketing cooperative Mrakov in South Bohemia.","[Nesetrilova, Helena; Rimovska, Pavla] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Nesetrilová, H (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",nesetrilova@pef.czu.cz; rimovska@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,397,402,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000338036100042,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cooperative advertising plays a significant role in marketing programs of channel members. Nevertheless, most studies to date on cooperative advertising have assumed that the market demand is only influenced by advertising expenditures but not by retail price. This paper addresses channel coordination by seeking optimal cooperative advertising strategies and equilibrium pricing in a two-member distribution channel. We establish and compare two models: a non-cooperative, leader-follower game and a cooperative game. We develop propositions and insights from the comparison of these models. The cooperative model achieves better coordination by generating higher channel-wide profits than the non-cooperative model with these features: (a) the retailer price is lower to consumers; and (b) the advertising efforts are higher for all channel members. We identify the feasible solutions to a bargaining problem where the channel members can determine how to divide the extra profits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, smart agriculture is transforming the agricultural sector in terms of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In some countries, cooperatives, as the most common legal form of the incumbent companies, in this rather traditional low-intensive technology sector, are going to develop a relevant role in the process of adoption of these technologies. In this context, this paper provides, first, a review of the evolution of the main digital technologies, such as Internet of Things, robots, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Blockchain, among others. Second, a description of the digital innovation process in agri-cooperatives in order to help them in the decision-making process, and third, a digital diagnosis tool for measuring cooperatives' digital innovation.

Previous researches suggest that the performance of the cooperatives is determined by their organizational design. Thus, this fact imposes the need to examine if the organizational models applied by the agricultural cooperatives affect their profitability outcome. This is the first Greek survey on performance contrasting traditional agricultural cooperatives and cooperatives with capital-seeking entities. Financial data of 34 cooperative organizations were used in a profitability equation, estimated with generalized error-structure model for a 5-years period. The findings show that there are differences in the economic results and the factors affecting profitability between these two types of cooperatives, providing evidence that the organizational type affects performance. The results also indicate that there exists management inefficiency especially for the traditional cooperatives. Based on the particular findings, cooperative practitioners and policymakers could advance their knowledge in order to boost performance level in cooperatives.","[Kontogeorgos, Achilleas] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion, Greece; [Sergaki, Panagiota; Kosma, Anastasia; Semou, Vassiliki] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Forestry & Nat Environm, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Patras; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Sergaki, P (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Forestry & Nat Environm, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece.",akontoge@upatras.gr; gsergaki@auth.gr; kosma@agro.auth.gr; vassoula@auth.gr,"Sergaki, Panagiota/AAN-8706-2021","SERGAKI, PANAGIOTA/0000-0003-1717-7091",State Scholarships Foundation (IKY),State Scholarships Foundation (IKY),The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their comments.

This paper presents a robust crop production model applied to an agricultural cooperative. The objective of the model is to maximize the total revenue of the cooperative. The social aspect is addressed through a similarity in farmer revenues. Moreover, crop yield uncertainty, which results from the difference in skills of the farmers, is integrated in the robust model. The crop production plan must satisfy the market demand for each crop. Consequently, crop production that exceeds the demand is penalized. The models are solved by an optimization software, and the results indicate that when the model robustness increases, the value of the objective function decreases. However, the decision maker can make a decision tradeoff between the probability of constraint satisfaction and the value of the objective function. Finally, the managerial recommendations are discussed.","[Pakawanich, Peerapong; Udomsakdigool, Apinanthana; Khompatraporn, Charoenchai] KMUTT, Dept Prod Engn, Fac Engn, 126 Pracha Uthit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi,"Udomsakdigool, A (corresponding author), KMUTT, Dept Prod Engn, Fac Engn, 126 Pracha Uthit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",peerapong.pak@mail.kmutt.ac.th; apinanthana.udo@kmutt.ac.th; charoenchai.kho@kmutt.ac.th,"Khompatraporn, Charoenchai/AFX-9402-2022","Khompatraporn, Charoenchai/0000-0002-0828-5798",KMUTT Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship [3/2558]; KMUTT 55th Anniversary Commemorative Fund,KMUTT Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship; KMUTT 55th Anniversary Commemorative Fund,"This research has been supported by the KMUTT Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship (3/2558) and the KMUTT 55th Anniversary Commemorative Fund.

Since cooperatives depend on members' contributions to achieve efficiency in processing and marketing, side-selling by members poses a threat to the economic viability of cooperatives in the long run. We develop a model for the farmers' marketing decision that relates farm size to the share of produce delivered to the cooperative. Based on survey data from cooperatively organised coffee farmers in Costa Rica, we find that the share delivered to cooperatives decreases with farm size, albeit at a decreasing rate. The empirical results thus confirm the theoretical model prediction of a u-shaped relationship between farm size and member deliveries.","[Wollni, Meike; Fischer, Elisabeth] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Wollni, M (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",mwollni1@uni-goettingen.de,,"Wollni, Meike/0000-0002-8460-7840",,,,,53,33,33,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Arguably, such success is caused by their superb ability to constantly adapt to the changing needs of their members and consumers. They do this by slightly modifying (tinkering) or completely altering (reinventing) their organizational design. This issue has not been studied in the context of agricultural cooperatives in former Soviet countries. Given the rising importance of agricultural cooperatives in such countries, however, understanding how cooperative adapt to the evolving preferences of their members and customers becomes of utter importance for both cooperative practitioners and policy makers. The current paper addresses the abovementioned knowledge gap. In particular, it identifies the ownership and governance models adopted by Estonian agricultural cooperatives, and provide key insights into how these organizations adapt to the changing needs of their members, consumers, and their external environment. Estonian agricultural cooperatives exhibit little experimentation with non-traditional ownership and governance models. This is due to the lack of technical expertise in the country, the relatively small size of the country's agricultural cooperatives, and their predominantly defensive strategies. Similarly to other European countries, tinkering is of outmost importance for Estonian agricultural cooperatives.","[Iliopoulos, Constantine] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dodekanissou 39, GR-15235 Athens, Greece; [Iliopoulos, Constantine] AGRERI, Agr Econ Res Inst, Dodekanissou 39, GR-15235 Athens, Greece; [Varnik, Rando; Volli, Liis] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwaldi 1, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Filippi, Maryline] UMR SAD APT, 16 Rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France; [Laanevali-Vinokurov, Kaie] Minist Rural Affairs Republ Estonia, Agr Policy Dept, Lai Tn 39 Lai Tn 41, EE-15056 Tallinn, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech,"Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dodekanissou 39, GR-15235 Athens, Greece.;Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), AGRERI, Agr Econ Res Inst, Dodekanissou 39, GR-15235 Athens, Greece.",iliopoulosC@agreri.gr; rando.varnik@emu.ee; maryline.filippi@agroparistech.fr; liis.volli@emu.ee; kaie.laanevali@agri.ee,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Filippi, Maryline/AAP-9718-2020; Iliopoulos, Constantine/F-9617-2014","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; , IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Filippi, Maryline/0000-0002-9323-1347; Iliopoulos, Constantine/0000-0002-1770-8270; Varnik, Rando/0000-0003-2268-7694",,,,,26,12,12,2,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

Domestic, labor-intensive and traditional food value chains and the smallholders they serve appear to be particularly affected. During a systemic shock where idiosyncratic risk coping strategies fail, collective or organizational resilience becomes of the essence to protect the livelihoods of smallholders. In this study, we have used pre- and during-shock data on agricultural cooperatives from Southeast Africa to understand how resilient these smallholder-owned organizations are. We find that many organizations could not countervail market-disruptions and fell into a state of dormancy during the pandemic. One reason for this is that collective decision-making was heavily affected by the banning of gatherings. Only a few organizations devised innovative solutions to maintain the market linkages of rural smallholders. The lack of resilience demonstrated by most cooperatives appears to be associated with organizational immaturity, large membership size, elite capture and limited business-orientation, which underscore a general lack of managerial capital.","[Francesconi, Nicola] Royal Trop Inst KIT, NL-1092 Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wouterse, Fleur] Global Ctr Adaptat GCA, NL-3072 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Birungi Namuyiga, Dorothy] Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Birungi Namuyiga, Dorothy] Natl Agr Res Org NARO, Entebbe 295, Uganda",University of Bonn,"Francesconi, N (corresponding author), Royal Trop Inst KIT, NL-1092 Amsterdam, Netherlands.",francesconi@edc.coop; fleur.wouterse@gca.org; dbirungi8@gmail.com,,"Birungi Namuyiga, Dorothy/0000-0002-8523-6930",OCDC; USAID's Cooperative Development Program; CTA; DEVCO-EU; CIAT; CGIAR,OCDC; USAID's Cooperative Development Program; CTA; DEVCO-EU; CIAT; CGIAR(CGIAR),"This research was funded by OCDC (using multiple grants received by USAID's Cooperative Development Program), as well as by CTA (using multiple grants received from DEVCO-EU) and CIAT (using multiple numbers received by the CGIAR and its donors).",,41,9,9,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,3,,,,,,,1046,10.3390/su13031046,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031046,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6BZ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000615602400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study suggests that the social capital paradigm may add explanatory power when analyzing this development. It is claimed that the problems are due to the members having increasingly little trust in the cooperatives and in each other. The cooperatives decision makers have no instruments for estimating how much social capital is lost when they pursue strategies of vertical and horizontal integration. Therefore, they do not consider this loss in their calculations. Thus, the problems caused by the cooperatives vaguely defined property rights are becoming increasingly serious.

However, there have been no efforts to investigate the role of collective entrepreneurship in the creation and management of new businesses in Morocco. Furthermore, we build on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate and explain entrepreneurial intention among the rural youth members of agricultural cooperatives, and identify the vulnerabilities and factors that influence the choice or decision-making between permanent membership at the cooperative and an entrepreneurial career. In this case, we apply the cognitive approach to survey rural youth in the Draa-Tafilalet region of Morocco in 2020. The binary logistic regression analysis technique has been used and applied to build the best model to explain why some rural youth members of the cooperative, but not others, choose to become entrepreneurs. We model how agricultural cooperatives may favor or inhibit the translation of entrepreneurial intention into new venture creation. A random sample size of 130 young people has been selected, from which 54 are intending to start a business and 76 have a negative intention of self-employment. The results of the analysis showed that socio-demographic variables, individual perceptions, previous experience, and the activities of the cooperative were statistically significant and reliable in building the binary logistic regression model. Findings also suggest that the risks of agribusiness and financing constraints have a negative influence on entrepreneurial intentions of the youth and women in agricultural cooperatives.","[Bouichou, El Houssain; Allali, Khalil] Agron & Vet Inst Hassan II, Dept Econ & Social Sci Appl Agr, BP 6202, Rabat 10101, Morocco; [Bouichou, El Houssain; Fadlaoui, Aziz] Econ & Sociol & Qual Reg Agr Res Ctr Km 10, Res Unit Management Nat Resources, Haj Kaddour Rd,POB 578 VN, Meknes 50000, Morocco; [Abdoulaye, Tahirou] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, Social Sci & Agribusiness, BP 320, Bamako 91094, Mali; [Bouayad, Abdelghani] Moulay Ismail Univ, Fac Econ & Social Legal Sci, Lab Social Sci & Econ, BP 3201 Toulal, Meknes 50000, Morocco",Moulay Ismail University of Meknes,"Bouichou, E (corresponding author), Agron & Vet Inst Hassan II, Dept Econ & Social Sci Appl Agr, BP 6202, Rabat 10101, Morocco.;Bouichou, E (corresponding author), Econ & Sociol & Qual Reg Agr Res Ctr Km 10, Res Unit Management Nat Resources, Haj Kaddour Rd,POB 578 VN, Meknes 50000, Morocco.",lhoussain.bouichou@inra.ma; T.Abdoulaye@cgiar.org; kallali@enameknes.ac.ma; bouayad_abdelghani@hotmail.com; aziz.fadlaoui@inra.ma,,"EL HOUSSAIN, BOUICHOU/0000-0002-3383-3039",International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) under the Research Fellowship Enhancing Capacity to Apply Research Evidence (CARE) in Policy for Youth Engagement in Agribusiness and Rural Economic Activities in Africa,International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) under the Research Fellowship Enhancing Capacity to Apply Research Evidence (CARE) in Policy for Youth Engagement in Agribusiness and Rural Economic Activities in Africa,This research is funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) under the Research Fellowship Enhancing Capacity to Apply Research Evidence (CARE) in Policy for Youth Engagement in Agribusiness and Rural Economic Activities in Africa.

However, few have examined the role of smartphone use in empowering women in decision-making and its mechanism. Therefore, this study analyzes how smartphone use affects women's decision-making power and explores whether this influence is due to women's off-farm employment mechanisms. For this purpose, the study uses the survey data of 1110 households in rural China and the endogenous treatment regression model for analysis. The control function approach addresses the selection bias of off-farm employment. The results show that smartphone use significantly increases women's decision-making power, partially channeled through increasing women's off-farm employment. The mechanism effect is robust to using both binary and intensive measurements of off-farm employment. Therefore, a policy to improve access to internet facilities and smartphone use could improve women's decision-making power through employment in the off-farm sector.","[Zheng, Hongyun] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuwen] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Rahut, Dil Bahadur] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan",Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, YW (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",yuwen_zhou@hust.edu.cn,"Zheng, Hongyun/AAV-6952-2020; Rahut, Dil Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022","Zheng, Hongyun/0000-0002-8205-6563; Rahut, Dil Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; [2662022JGQD006],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities);,"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Hongyun Zheng acknowledges the financial support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2662022JGQD006).

In this study, the relationship between the financial and social efficiency of South African agricultural cooperatives was examined. Data, comprising 1788 agricultural cooperatives, were obtained from the Cooperative Data Analysis System database. Only 387 observations without missing values were predicted in the empirical model. Data envelopment analysis scores for the financial and social efficiency indicators were computed. A two-stage residual inclusion method estimated the social efficiency model. The results show that social efficiency is positively influenced by financial efficiency and other factors. These include the number of employees, the enterprise type, and compliance with internal control practices. The social efficiency of agricultural cooperatives decreases for institutions that have recently been trained and that comply with the annual financial audits and profit tax. Social efficiency also decreases with age, but it increases with the square of the agricultural cooperative's age. This suggests that financially-efficient agricultural cooperatives may achieve social efficiency, that young agricultural cooperatives are not the ideal candidates for addressing the social efficiency challenges of agricultural cooperatives, and that the current training received by agricultural cooperatives does not empower them with social efficiency.","[Yobe, Collin L.; Ferrer, Stuart R.

Excessive consumption of available resources polluted the environment and altered climate patterns. Depleting fossil fuels in the near future and climate change will force world countries to tend to renewable energy sources. The present research was conducted to investigate the renewable energy awareness and adaptation of managers of agricultural development cooperatives composed of farmers, the most vulnerable segment of society to climate change. With the questionnaires, data were gathered about the general status of agricultural cooperatives, the socio-economic status of cooperative managers, managers' level of knowledge, and awareness of renewable energy resources. Survey data were subjected to fuzzy pairwise comparison and chi-square tests. Present findings revealed that cooperative managers had a medium level of knowledge on renewable energy.

Several studies have tried to assess the importance of diversification on the financial outcomes in agricultural co-operatives with limited success. Design/methodology/approach The three main concepts were combined in a working model. A survey was developed to gather data on financial, diversification and expansion strategies from 67 co-operatives (44 per cent return rate). Data were processed using a partial least squares structural equation model. Findings The findings suggest that expansion is directly responsible for both the financial output and diversification strategy; however, no hard evidence supports the view that the diversification of production in some agro-industrial co-operatives leads to positive financial results. Research limitations/implications Only larger Brazilian co-operatives (>$50m in annual revenues) were considered. Co-operatives facing other scenarios or smaller co-operatives could have different outcomes. Practical implications Besides diversifying their co-operatives for financial reasons, managers should also consider risk aversion and adapting to new farmers' portfolios as probable reasons. Originality/value Extant literature asserts that diversification leads to financial growth; as the co-operatives studied show no such causal relationship, it follows that they diversify their portfolios for other purposes.","[Martins, Fellipe Silva; Lucato, Wagner Cezar] Univ Nove Julho, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Da Silva, Dirceu] Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Nove de Julho; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Martins, FS (corresponding author), Univ Nove Julho, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",silvamartinsfellipe@gmail.com,"Martins, Fellipe Silva/AAA-6128-2019; Martins, Fellipe Silva/AAA-6061-2019","Martins, Fellipe Silva/0000-0003-3918-7231; Martins, Fellipe Silva/0000-0003-3918-7231",,,,,78,5,6,2,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A comprehensive assessment of co-operatives therefore requires an examination of non-conventional factors, in addition to the conventional factors. Three such non-conventional factors identified in the literature are 1) commitment, 2) heterogeneity and 3) social capital. Commitment is important for agricultural co-operatives because one pre-requisite for successful agricultural co-operatives is that farmer-members are willing to supply the co-operative with raw products, capital and managerial inputs. In this research affective, continuance, normative and other aspects of member commitment are examined. Heterogeneity is an important source of concern for co-operatives due to its impact on cohesiveness and collective decision making. This study used characteristics associated with the farmer-member and the farm-business to examine heterogeneity. It has been suggested that the social capital paradigm is the common denominator for all explanations and theories on co-operative formation and development. A modified version of the six dimensions' framework used by the World Bank to assess social capital was used in this study. Based on this theoretical underpinning, a Three Dimensional Conceptual Framework, that encapsulates commitment, heterogeneity and social capital is developed and described.","[Apparao, Dhananjay; Garnevska, Elena; Shadbolt, Nicola] Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Apparao, D (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",M.D.Apparao@massey.ac.nz; E.V.Garnevska@massey.ac.nz; N.M.Shadbolt@massey.ac.nz,", Elena/ABF-4038-2020",", Elena/0000-0002-2453-4539",,,,,89,18,19,2,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

The lack of an appropriate methodological basis for creating agricultural cooperative system prevents the process of organizing formation of new agricultural cooperatives, which leads to an objective need to develop the organizational and economic basis for the formation and operation of agricultural cooperatives. In this regard, the research and study of theoretical aspects, analysis of objective conditions for the formation and operation of agricultural cooperatives, development of methodological provisions and practical recommendations to substantiate their organizational and economic mechanism, including matters of management, profit, price, credit, formation and distribution are topical to the issue and most of the components listed above are of great practical importance. Aim and tasks. The aim of the research is to develop scientific, organizational and economic basis for the establishment and operation of agricultural cooperatives in a multistructural economy. The objectives of the research are: identifying the essence of the cooperative, adding several principles to the formation and classification of agricultural cooperatives, determining the conditions and factors necessary for their creation. Results. Theoretical and regulatory aspects of formation and development of agricultural cooperatives were specified taking into account the introduction of new principles for their operation: mandatory creation of indivisible funds for innovative activities, agricultural producers' interest and expediency for their participation in the associations; and classification of cooperatives in the production and service industries. Conclusions. Based on consideration of the integrated approach to the formation of cooperatives and farmers' organizations, necessary documentation and calculation of economic efficiency, the methodological provisions developed in the process of the research on the establishment and operation of agricultural cooperatives will allow agricultural producers to approach the formation of necessary cooperatives skillfully, easily determine the absolute and specific tax burden of agricultural cooperatives.","[Sanikidze, Hamlet] Batumi Shota Rustaveli State Univ, Batumi, Georgia",Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University,"Sanikidze, H (corresponding author), Batumi Shota Rustaveli State Univ, Batumi, Georgia.",hamleti2015@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,Dr. Viktor Koval,Odessa,"Inglezi, 6, Odessa, UKRAINE",2616-7107,,,ECON ECOL SOC,Econ.

Although there has been some theoretical discussion about this issue, no empirical research has been done on these costs; the present study aims to bridge this gap. Following the literature, the main source of democratic costs in agricultural cooperatives is the level of member participation in cooperative governance. We have developed more specific theoretical insights about this special kind of decision-making cost by showing the effect of differences in the level of member participation on democratic costs, differences in terms of democratic and influence costs and in terms of agency costs, and differences between both direct and opportunity democratic costs. Members should take both the relative direct and opportunity costs within total democratic costs into account when determining the optimal size and composition of their board.

Industrial organization and new institutional economics theories explain the existence of agricultural cooperatives and farmers' participation in them through their ability to develop 'countervailing power' within markets and internalizing transaction costs, respectively. Using a unique dataset that includes community, cooperative, and household level survey data, this study empirically investigates the drivers of agricultural cooperatives formation and farmers' membership and patronage decisions in Ethiopia. The results indicate that agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia tend to exist in locations that are connected to major roads with relatively well-developed market structures, supporting the industrial organization argument linked to market power for their formation more than the new institutionalists argument linked to overcoming potential contractual failures. A farm household's decision to join and use agricultural cooperatives, on the other hand, is strongly related to their location, scale of operation, specialization, and human and relational capital. A household's membership and patronage decisions are also affected by the size, specialization, and integration of the agricultural cooperative itself.","[Abate, Gashaw Tadesse] IFPRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Abate, GT (corresponding author), IFPRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",g.abate@cgiar.org,,,,,,,68,30,32,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

However, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in the cooperative legal form. This research has followed this rebirth in a region in the western United States where rural producers and urban consumers, gentrifying communities of color, and environmentally minded communities strive to improve other communities and food futures. As part of these efforts, it can be easy to assume cooperation within a legal status. Yet, as this research examines, cooperatives can be quite uncooperative in practice. Through extensive field work, we found that food and agriculture cooperatives struggle to make decision-making inclusive, may reproduce inequities through leadership performance, and may unevenly distribute the emotional work necessary to cooperation. These patterns also relate to how cooperatives access resources and point to tensions in expanding networks. While homogeneity can make interactions smoother-thereby making trust and day-to-day activities easier-it also limits a cooperative's (co-op) resource access. Resource access can be improved through partnerships, such as with nonprofits. However, these connections can lead to certain leadership performances that delegitimize cooperative efforts from the perspective of structurally disadvantaged community members. Further, the anonymity that consumers have become accustomed to creates challenges for recruiting shoppers because co-ops take more emotional work. A disproportionate amount of emotional work falls on staff members, contributing to resentment and insincere performance. We make a number of suggestions about how cooperatives can work to improve both organizational and interactional forms of cooperation.","[Hale, James] Univ Otago, Ctr Sustainabil, 563 Castle St N, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Carolan, Michael] Colorado State Univ, Res & Grad Affairs, B241 Clark, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Carolan, Michael] Colorado State Univ, Dept Sociol, B241 Clark, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Otago; Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Hale, J (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Ctr Sustainabil, 563 Castle St N, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.",James.Hale@otago.ac.nz; Michael.Carolan@colostate.edu,,"Hale, James/0000-0002-4144-9117",U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NIFA-COL00725]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2924243],U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA-COL00725) and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A3A2924243).,,37,5,5,1,10,LYSON CENTER CIVIC AGRICULTURE & FOOD SYSTEMS,ITHACA,"295 HOOK PL, ITHACA, NY 14850 USA",2152-0798,2152-0801,,J AGRIC FOOD SYST CO,J.

Based on the survey data of 7200 farmers in four provinces of China, this paper uses the multi-dimensional poverty measurement method and the instrumental variable method to reveal the transmission mechanism and multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect of farmers' cooperatives in deep poverty-stricken areas in China to realize joint agricultural empowerment through the supply chain. The results show that farmers' cooperatives play an important role in enhancing small farmers' financing, technology application, market sales, and rights decision-making. Every increase in the degree of interest connection between the two will help farmers reduce the multi-dimensional poverty level by 12.3%, and the mitigation effects on material poverty, ability poverty, and rights poverty are between 10% and 13%. Compared with agricultural cooperatives with weak organizational service capacity, cooperatives with high organizational service capacity have a more significant multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect on farmers, which leads to farmers obtaining financing and improving their ability and income. In addition, the difference in benefit coupling between agricultural cooperatives and farmers of different leading bodies also results in the heterogeneity of multi-dimensional poverty alleviation effects of farmers. To a certain extent, the supply chain is affected by the risk endowment of members, the supply chain's poverty alleviation performance is affected by members' supply chain's poverty alleviation performance, and there is a certain risk transfer and distribution failure. Therefore, optimizing the benefit coupling structure and risk sharing mechanism between farmers' cooperatives and farmers has become an important way to break the pattern of the strong are always strong and distribution failure for supply chain members and farmers.","[Shen, Yun; Wang, Rui; Chandio, Abbas Ali] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinmin; Wu, Bin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham, England; [Wang, Luyao] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Ye, Xuelan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Han, Yang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, China Western Econ Res Inst, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; University of Nottingham; Xiamen University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Chandio, AA (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",alichandio@sicau.edu.cn,"Yang, Han/AAW-4493-2021","Yang, Han/0000-0001-9251-3863; Wu, Bin/0000-0002-7568-1993; CHANDIO, Abbas Ali/0000-0001-8706-9681; Wang, Jinmin/0000-0002-7160-7999","Chengdu Soft Science Project: Research on Enabling Chengdu Urban Agriculture and Food Industry Ecosphere by Scientific and Technological Innovation [2021RK0000246ZF]; Foreign Youth Talents Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology: Research on the Impact of ICT, Technology Development and Climate Change on Grain Production in Asian Countries [QN2022036001]; Tianfu New Area Rural Revitalization Research Institute Project: Research on Tianfu New Area Rural Industry Revitalization and Development System [XZY1-18]; University of Nottingham Global Challenges Research Fund (UoN-GCRF) sponsored project: Cooperative ecosystem to empower small farmers in the poor areas of China [RIS.: 2427898/2180292]","Chengdu Soft Science Project: Research on Enabling Chengdu Urban Agriculture and Food Industry Ecosphere by Scientific and Technological Innovation; Foreign Youth Talents Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology: Research on the Impact of ICT, Technology Development and Climate Change on Grain Production in Asian Countries; Tianfu New Area Rural Revitalization Research Institute Project: Research on Tianfu New Area Rural Industry Revitalization and Development System; University of Nottingham Global Challenges Research Fund (UoN-GCRF) sponsored project: Cooperative ecosystem to empower small farmers in the poor areas of China","This research was funded by Chengdu Soft Science Project: Research on Enabling Chengdu Urban Agriculture and Food Industry Ecosphere by Scientific and Technological Innovation (No.: 2021RK0000246ZF), Foreign Youth Talents Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology: Research on the Impact of ICT, Technology Development and Climate Change on Grain Production in Asian Countries (No.: QN2022036001), Tianfu New Area Rural Revitalization Research Institute Project: Research on Tianfu New Area Rural Industry Revitalization and Development System (No.: XZY1-18), and University of Nottingham Global Challenges Research Fund (UoN-GCRF) sponsored project: Cooperative ecosystem to empower small farmers in the poor areas of China (RIS.: 2427898/2180292).",,64,2,2,14,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2022,11,10,,,,,,,1836,10.3390/land11101836,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101836,,,23,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5P3PP,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000873066800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The uncertainty of the subjective and imprecise assessments derived from estimated data that represent the analyzed criteria characterizes the decision-making process. To reduce the uncertainties related to IT project priority setting, we proposed a model based on a hybrid multicriteria method composed by the best-worst method to establish the weights of the criteria and fuzzy-TOPSIS to define the project ranking. The model allows us (1) to define strategic subcriteria, (2) adjust the weights according to the company's reality, (3) to deal with the uncertainties of the evaluations of the decision makers, and (4) provide the project ranking that translates reality into the distribution of resources in the IT sector. Finally, we applied the model to a case study in the IT sector of a Brazilian agroindustrial cooperative. For the managers, the method provides a precise decision aiding tool.

In Ethiopia, cooperatives are considered as important vehicles for linking smallholder farmers to markets and for rural development more generally. However, member commitment in cooperatives is not self-evident. Different scholars confirm that there is a decline in commitment of members to their cooperative. Consequently, it is important to identify what factors drive this decline to enhance member commitment and promote the performance of cooperatives. Thus, this paper seeks to explore the determinants of member commitment. Our empirical analysis is based on a 2014 survey among 240 members of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia. This paper makes two contributions to the academic body of knowledge on member commitment in agricultural cooperatives. First, it distinguishes between three elements of commitment: loyalty, identification and participation. By exploring the determinants of each element of commitment, we obtain a much richer picture of what drives members. Second, we make a distinction between multipurpose cooperatives and specialized marketing cooperatives. The study has important implications for policy makers, government and stakeholders of cooperatives for devising appropriate interventions that could enhance the commitment of members in agricultural cooperatives.","[Awoke, Habtamu Mekonnen] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Econ & Consumer Studies, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Awoke, HM (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Econ & Consumer Studies, Wageningen, Netherlands.",habtamubau@yahoo.com,,,,,,,51,5,5,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1975,,,COGENT BUS MANAG,Cogent Bus.

Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the ideas of Habermas and Luhmann, this paper interprets preference heterogeneity of cooperative members in terms of the precarious relationship between the categories of system and lifeworld. The argument is buttressed with a case study of an agricultural cooperative recently founded in Central Greece. Findings - The sensitivity of cooperatives to the lifeworld contexts of their members exacts the price in the form of the member preference heterogeneity problem. If this sensitivity is taken to be the constitutive characteristic of cooperatives, then the proposed argument hammers home their fundamental ambivalence, as they are necessarily fraught with the potential for internal conflict. Research limitations/implications - The paper urges for a radical rethinking of Georg Draheim's thesis of the double nature of cooperatives. Double nature is shown to aggravate the member preference heterogeneity problem. Practical implications - The results of this study inform the cooperative leaders' quest to strike a balance between the interests of their members and the demands of the external socio-economic environment. Originality/value - This research contributes significantly to the literature on collective decision-making costs incurred by cooperatives. The failure of cooperatives to balance the sensitivity to members' interests and to the external environment is exposed as the root cause of the divergence and heterogeneity of member preferences. This heterogeneity is shown to boost collective decision-making costs.","[Iliopoulos, Constantine] Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Athens, Greece; [Iliopoulos, Constantine] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Athens, Greece; [Valentinov, Vladislav] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Economies, Halle, Germany",Agricultural University of Athens,"Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Athens, Greece.;Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Athens, Greece.",iliopoulosC@agreri.gr,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Iliopoulos, Constantine/F-9617-2014; Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; , IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Iliopoulos, Constantine/0000-0002-1770-8270;",Wissenschaftscampus Halle,Wissenschaftscampus Halle,The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments.

Agricultural cooperatives are business organizations that fully examine all the economic, democratic and social dimensions of poverty reduction in rural areas simultaneously. This research is an exploratory research that was conducted in two parts: qualitative and quantitative. In the qualitative section, by holding several meetings with experts and through the method of brainstorming, the opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses for the adapting of the agricultural cooperative organization to learning organization were identified. Then, using the SWOT model, strategies and action plan were identified for adapting the cooperative organization to the learning organization. Also, in the quantitative part of the research that was conducted among the members of the cooperatives, through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the role of the identified strategies was evaluated and the designed model was approved. Based on the results, the predictive positive effect of identified strategies include: SO1 (beta= 0.73, t-Value = 4.23, P< 0.001), SO2 (beta = 0.79, t-Value = 4.71, P<0.001), SO3 (beta= 0.81, t-Value = 5.08, P< 0.001) and SO4 (beta = 0.82, t-Value = 4.97, P<0.001) on Adapting Cooperatives to the Learning Organization (ACLO).

Using this classification and integrating concepts from the business literature (i.e., market and brand orientation), we hypothesize three types of relationships: (a) the influence of organizational attributes, i.e., ownership, control and cost/benefit allocation, on organizational performance; (b) the influence of strategic, i.e., market and brand orientation, attributes on organizational performance, and (c) the influence of organizational attributes on market orientation. We examine these relationships empirically in two studies. In study 1, using data from 114 agribusiness cooperatives, we demonstrate that strategic attributes have a greater influence on organizational performance than organizational attributes. In study 2, we replicate the design from study 1, i.e., tracking attribute scores over time, with a subsample of 25 cooperatives 4 years later. This second study generally confirms the findings of study 1. Taken together, the results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on strategic attributes both in the literature and in practice.

The nature of this process is analyzed, and the corresponding demand and supply functions with single- and multi-stage discount strategies are constructed, respectively, to create a working model. The optimal discount ratios for supermarkets and agricultural cooperatives in decentralized and centralized decision-making modes coupled with single- and multi-stage discounts are calculated, respectively. Finally, a universal optimal strategy is designed, which can be applied to various quantity decay scenarios and makes the discount strategy more generalized. The results show that discounts can coordinate supply chains more effectively; not only would fresh agricultural produce be sold out before it starts to rot, but also the benefit conflicts arising from both supermarkets vs. cooperatives and traditional vs. E-commerce channels could be equilibrated. Further, multi-stage discounts are more difficult to coordinate than single-stage ones, the corresponding optimal discount ratios rely on the initial quantity of fresh agricultural produce in the supply chain, its market share in the traditional distribution channel, the potential market size, retail price, the price sensitivity coefficient of the channel, the cross-elasticity coefficient of prices between different channels, and the properties of the quantity loss. It is concluded that, regardless of what kind of quantity and quality loss occurs, whether decentralized or centralized decision making is selected, or whether the supermarket's or agricultural cooperative's discount ratio is considered, a universal price discount consisting of a fixed term and a drift term could both maximize supply chain profit and coordinate this dual-channel supply chain.","[Zheng, Xiaojing] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Weifang, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaojing] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Agr Sage Culture Studies, Weifang, Peoples R China",,"Zheng, XJ (corresponding author), Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Weifang, Peoples R China.;Zheng, XJ (corresponding author), Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Agr Sage Culture Studies, Weifang, Peoples R China.",zhengxj@wfust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671054]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2020MG004],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province),This research was funded by [National Natural Science Foundation of China] grant number [71671054] and [Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province] grant number [ZR2020MG004].

Design/methodology/approach A combination of propensity score matching technique and sample selection stochastic frontier framework that addresses potential selection bias due to observable and unobservable attributes is used to estimate the effect of participation between cooperative members and non-members. Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated and compared. Findings The empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates that cooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantly associated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, total farmland, distance to market and geographic location). Practical implications The findings of this study demonstrate that cooperative organisations can be an important tool to enhance the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers. Successful cooperative models together with training programs designed to enlighten farmers on the importance and tangible benefits of collective action should be used to enlarge participation in cooperative organisations. In addition, governments and development agencies should implement targeted investment and capacity building programs related to irrigation management, gender-sensitive awareness and development of the internal institutional mechanisms in cooperatives for the transfer of knowledge and mutual learning so that all members benefit from cooperatives. Originality/value Despite the pervasive evidence of the impact of cooperatives on productivity and technical efficiency in the Asian region, this study is probably the first attempt in the crop sector in Mongolia. It provides a rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency through a counterfactual design.","[Ahado, Samuel; Hejkrlik, Jiri; Enkhtur, Anudari; Ratinger, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Tseren, Tserendavaa] Mongolian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Mongolian University of Life Sciences,"Ratinger, T (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic.",ahado@ftz.czu.cz; Hejkrlik@ftz.czu.cz; e.anudari@yahoo.com; tserendavaa.ts@muls.edu.mn; ratinger@tc.cz,"Ahado, Samuel/IAP-9517-2023; Hejkrlik, Jiri/L-9689-2013; Tseren, Tserendavaa/AAB-3892-2021","Hejkrlik, Jiri/0000-0002-1337-5261; Tseren, Tserendavaa/0000-0001-5328-2521; Ahado, Samuel/0000-0001-6735-0927","Internal Grant Agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, (CIGA) [20185001]; Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20205008]","Internal Grant Agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, (CIGA); Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Internal Grant Agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, (CIGA) project No. (20185001) and the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, project No. (20205008).

We argue that both people and processes are behind the decision-making of project implementation. Member and professional CEOs of cooperatives differ regarding their managerial vision towards upstream and downstream projects. Cooperatives with member CEOs are upstream focused and it is reflected by the cascading effect of negative vision bias towards downstream projects. When downstream activities become more important, cooperatives need to replace the member CEOs with professional CEOs. However, a cooperative with a professional CEO may still be in a disadvantageous position if the member-dominated Board of Directors' negative bias towards downstream projects is too strong, which may result in an investor owned firm being the efficient governance structure.","[Deng, Wendong; Hendrikse, George W.

By using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database, we created a sample of 37 U.S. agro cooperatives. For analysis, we used panel regression analysis as it is suitable to deal with fixed effect or random effect error component presented in the model. Finding states that the U.S. agro cooperatives are found highly sensitive to economic policy uncertainty. The results provide evidence of a negative relationship between size and profitability. Moreover, the impact of growth and capital intensity is also reflected in the return on asset (ROA). In this study, we considered ROA as a proxy for firm performance.

The objective of this study was to analyze the key characteristics of engagements established between agricultural cooperatives and other actors and determine their success level. An analytical framework was developed to highlight nine areas, namely partnership configuration, stakeholders, objectives of the partnerships, partnership types, partnership stages, communication methods, achieved outcomes, partnership evaluation, and partnership sustainability. The targets were all agricultural cooperatives building associations with other actors between 2016 and 2020 in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the study covered 69 partnerships founded by 32 agricultural cooperatives. The results revealed that the cooperatives involved in partnerships essentially provide farming inputs and equipment for their stakeholders and capacity building and training purposes. The public sector was the leading actor that collaborated with agricultural cooperatives in inter-sector partnerships. The findings also showed that 55.1% of the partnerships were strategic partnerships in cases of both independent value formation and integrative partnerships. By focusing on mapping the partnerships, this study presents beneficial information for policy-makers working on how agricultural cooperatives dealt with the other actors and the lessons gathered to build future sustainability collaborations.","[Alotaibi, Bader Alhafi; Kassem, Hazem S.] King Saud Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",King Saud University,"Kassem, HS (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",hskassem@ksu.edu.sa,"Kassem, Hazem/AAG-9089-2020","Kassem, Hazem/0000-0001-9327-3283; Alhafi-Alotaibi, Bader/0000-0002-9633-4341","King Saud University, Saudi Arabia [RSP/2022-443]","King Saud University, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This research was funded by the Researchers Supporting Program, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia (RSP/2022-443).

Although these cooperatives have been promoted as ideal bottom-to-top organizations to integrate women into economy as entrepreneurs, there has been significant decline in their numbers. This paper tackles with this contradictory situation and intends to offer an alternative research framework on the viability of the women's agricultural cooperatives in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach The paper is built on a critical assessment of the existing literature. It argues that a framework that brings together macro-, meso- and micro-factors will provide a springboard to unfold the gendered processes integral to rural female entrepreneurship in Turkey. Drawing on intersectional theory, the multilayered factors which operate to rural women's (dis)advantages through the cooperatives are unfolded as policymaking, policy implementation and everyday experiences. Findings For policymakers and implementers, it points out the need for a holistic and integrated understanding of rural female entrepreneurship and for re-formulation of policies at the state level. For rural women, it draws attention to the measures required to be taken at the cooperative level to overcome inequalities. Originality/value This paper is original in making explicit social, political and economic embeddedness of female entrepreneurship in rural Turkey.","[Kurtege Sefer, Bengu] Koc Univ, Ctr Gender Studies, KOC KAM, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kurtege Sefer, Bengu] Koc Univ, Gender Equal & Sustainable Dev, Istanbul, Turkey",Koc University; Koc University,"Sefer, BK (corresponding author), Koc Univ, Ctr Gender Studies, KOC KAM, Istanbul, Turkey.",bsefer@ku.edu.tr,"Kurtege Sefer, Bengu/HJI-1915-2023","Kurtege Sefer, Bengu/0000-0002-0539-8375",,,,,73,9,9,4,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-6266,1756-6274,,INT J GEND ENTREP,Int.

Being the lowest echelon of a co-operative's internal governance hierarchy, district councils constitute a link between the membership and the board of directors. Previous research indicates that district council members are often driven by a co-operative conviction and social concerns. The present study challenges this view. On the basis of a survey of all 191 district council members and council chairpersons of a large Swedish agricultural co-operative, it is found that the elected representatives rank low in terms of co-operative conviction and social concerns. They involve themselves mainly in order to get personal benefits; they want to gain access to information, mature personally and obtain inputs to develop their farm enterprises.

Design/methodology/approach - This research used the geometric mean of the real rate of return on equity to identify financially stressed agricultural cooperatives. The real rate of return on equity allows the allocation of total financial stress among the return on assets, leverage and interest rate issues. Findings - This study found that financially non-stressed agricultural cooperatives had a higher rate of return on equity and rate of return on assets, but lower leverage ratios and interest rates than stressed agricultural cooperatives. Further, non-stressed cooperatives had higher total assets and sales compared to stressed cooperatives. This suggests that smaller cooperatives are more likely to face financial stress than larger cooperatives. The decomposition of the financial problem showed that a substantial percentage of financial stress was correlated with a low return on assets or profitability. A smaller percentage of financial stress was due to financing decisions. Originality/value - This study provides value by measuring the impact of profitability, leverage and interest rate on the financial performance of agricultural cooperatives. Results showed that a substantial proportion of financial stress was associated with a low return on assets. This indicates that profitability is a problem for agricultural cooperatives.

Method / approach: A quantitative and descriptive research was carried out with 262 employees of an agricultural cooperative. As a data collection instrument, the Scale of Perception of Organizational Support, short version (EPSO-R), developed by Queiroga, Brandao and Borges-Andrade (2015) was used. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used in order to list the most important criteria and sub-criteria under the perception of the investigated collaborators. Main findings: As main results, it is observed that employees prioritized Promotion and reward practices, especially with regard to symbolic and material rewards, the cooperative is also concerned with ensuring equipment and materials necessary for the effective performance of their tasks and granting bonuses to its employees as profit sharing (PLR). Employees also prioritized Material support for performance, this action demonstrates that the investigated cooperative provides individuals with an adequate and comfortable environment to carry out routine activities.

Originality / relevance: It is noteworthy that this research opens the way to highlight the importance of the theme of organizational support for the area of people management and organizational behavior in the context of cooperatives.","[Ramadam, Amanda Oliveira; Barros Estivalete, Vania de Fatima; Wegner, Roger Da Silva; Parcianello, Jose Adroaldo] Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM, Av Roraima 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Ramadam, AO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria UFSM, Av Roraima 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",amandaramadam@gmail.com; vaniaestivalete@ufsm.br; rswegnerr@gmail.com; parcianello@ufsm.br,,,,,,,47,0,0,3,7,UNIV COMUNITARIA REGIONAL CHAPECO-UNOCHAPECO,SANTA CATARINA,"AVE SENADOR ATTILIO FONTANA, 591-E, BAIRRO EFAPI, CAIXA POSTAL 1141 CHAPECO, SANTA CATARINA, 89809-000, BRAZIL",1983-6635,,,REV GEST ORGAN,Rev.

We address this substantial knowledge gap by focusing on Estonian agricultural cooperatives. Using survey results from a sample of 23 Estonian agricultural cooperatives, we identify board structures and processes, measure organizational health, and compare our findings to similar studies in other countries. We find both similarities and differences between sample cooperatives and their counterparts in other countries. Estonian agricultural cooperatives tend to perform better than those without a board. However, more research at the member level is needed in order to draw definite conclusions. Member preference heterogeneity emerges as a potential future threat to organizational health and, thus, demands the attention of cooperative leaders in Estonia. We conclude that there exists considerable room for improvement through the introduction of a more flexible legal framework and the adoption of professional board governance processes, which includes director orientation training, inclusion of additional financial expertise and board evaluation routines.","[Iliopoulos, Constantine] Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Kourtidou 56-58, Athens 11145, Greece; [Varnik, Rando; Kiisk, Taavi; Sinnott, Liis] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Econ Rural Econ, FR Kreutzwaldi 1a, EE-51006 Tartu, Estonia; [Varthalamis, George] CoopAbil Inst, Thrakis 2, Thrakis 16777, Greece",Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Kourtidou 56-58, Athens 11145, Greece.",iliopoulosc@agreri.gr,"Iliopoulos, Constantine/F-9617-2014","Iliopoulos, Constantine/0000-0002-1770-8270; Varnik, Rando/0000-0003-2268-7694",Estonian Research Council from the European Regional Development Fund; [RITA2/060],Estonian Research Council from the European Regional Development Fund;,"This research was funded by the Estonian Research Council from the European Regional Development Fund, grant number RITA2/060.",,109,0,0,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2022,14,23,,,,,,,16031,10.3390/su142316031,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142316031,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6X0EJ,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000896096800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although market orientation has been considered one of those critical resources, there is little understanding regarding how it is created and nurtured in business relationships. In the context of asymmetrical channel partnerships dominated by a downstream leader, in this paper we present a model where the upstream follower's market orientation is promoted as a consequence of the leader's use of authoritative mechanisms of coordination. Some hypotheses are presented and empirically tested in a sample of agricultural cooperatives that maintain channel partnerships with second-order marketing cooperatives. The results indicate that formalization, participation, input control, and behaviour control are coordination mechanisms that lead to improvements in market orientation.

This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural sector, specifically farming intensification and the government's focus on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda's economic development has been impressive, many academics have argued that Rwanda's growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions as well as sustainable economic development.","[Meador, John Elliot] Scotlands Rural Coll, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [O'Brien, David] Univ Missouri, Rural Sociol, 109 Gentry Hall, Columbia, MO USA",Scotland's Rural College; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Meador, JE (corresponding author), Scotlands Rural Coll, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",Elliot.meador@sruc.ac.uk; obriendj@missouri.edu,,"Meador, John Elliot/0000-0002-2997-6969",United States Agency for International Development (US) [AID-OAA-A-10-00016],United States Agency for International Development (US),This project is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (US) (AID-OAA-A-10-00016).,,26,10,10,6,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,AUG,2019,11,4,,,,,869,880,,10.1007/s12571-019-00944-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00944-9,,,12,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,IT5KE,,hybrid,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000482900700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The comparative analysis shows the relevance of the social and cultural contexts in shaping the mechanisms of governance, as well contributing to the policy debate in the European Union regarding new food quality schemes.","[Moragues-Faus, Ana M.; Ortiz-Miranda, Dionisio] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Moragues-Faus, AM (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",anmofau@doctor.upv.es,"Moragues-Faus, Ana/AAB-6812-2021; Ortiz-Miranda, Dionisio/D-3839-2011","Moragues-Faus, Ana/0000-0001-7926-6394; Ortiz-Miranda, Dionisio/0000-0002-6884-8927",,,,,24,3,4,0,12,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,MAR,2012,41,1,,,,,27,33,,10.5367/oa.2012.0072,http://dx.doi.org/10.5367/oa.2012.0072,,,7,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,925LZ,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000302764000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

While fruitful, this focus misses the motivations that prompt firms to take economic action in the first place. Understanding cultural embeddedness provides insight into why individuals and firms behave as they do and how their behavior can influence network structure. Contrary to the belief that firms act solely for profit and growth, we note that cultural contents such as values, social issues and political ideologies explain firms' motives and guide their economic activities. We explore the role of cultural embeddedness through a grounded study of Country Natural Beef, a sustainability-oriented agricultural cooperative in the western United States. This supply network demonstrates strongly competing cultural claims among its members as well as a unique institutionalized culture. Cultural interactions at the node and network levels explain the functioning of and changes to the network. Through interviews, analysis of archival information and direct observation of pivotal events over a period of 5 years, we unpack cultural embeddedness and take an incremental step toward a theory of cultural embeddedness in cooperative supply networks.

Seemingly unrelated regression analysis was used to identify the impact of members' perceptions of agency problems on the attitude measures obtained from the exploratory factor analysis. The results suggest that perceived agency problems significantly explain members' attitudes to their cooperatives. Therefore, working with these problems can be a way for directors of cooperatives to influence members' attitudes and, in continuation, behaviors to these.

The purpose of this paper is to provide information about the prospects of the cooperative sector as a means to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants in the rural environment, to ensure the increase in the producers' revenues, to consolidate the economic role of the producers' occupational entities, to improve and develop the activity in the agricultural sector and implicitly in the national economy. The current economic crisis has led to the development of cooperatives in Romania as well. Thus, we may say that at national level, according to the year they were established, there has been an increase in the number of cooperatives beginning with 2009, when 56 were registered. In 2010 the number increased to 81, and in 2011 the number of registered cooperatives decreased, reaching 54.

However, due largely to data limitations, we know very little about the monetary value of ownership held by members and how value changes across members of differing characteristics. Through a discrete choice experiment with more than 200 dairy farmers in the United States, we examine these issues explicitly for dairy marketing cooperatives that purchase their members' milk and process it into finished dairy products. Results suggest that dairy farmers, on aggregate, are willing to accept lower per hundredweight compensation, 2.3% of the average milk price, to be cooperative members relative to selling to independent handlers. Results also suggest dairy farmers actively consider the industry wide impacts within pricing offers on preferences for other milk pricing attributes. The inclusion of demographic covariates highlights preferences important to understanding heterogeneous member interests and, thus, informing improved cooperative governance strategies and board decision making to address them.","[Munch, Daniel M.; Schmit, Todd M.; Severson, Roberta M.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 350A Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Schmit, TM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 350A Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tms1@cornell.edu,,"Schmit, Todd/0000-0002-7297-554X",Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station (Hatch/Multistate funds) [1013677]; National Institutes of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station (Hatch/Multistate funds); National Institutes of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),"This work was supported by a joint research under 1013677 and extension program funded by the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station (Hatch/Multistate funds) and Cornell Cooperative Extension (Smith Lever funds) received from the National Institutes of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) .

They support collective activities where individual incentives are insufficient to produce public goods. The government of Nepal has been investing economic resources in this sector, prioritizing cooperatives as part of a strategy for poverty reduction. This study examines poor farmers' access to agricultural cooperatives and the impact of membership on farm and total household income, based on a household survey of 572 households and key informant interviews of 37 cooperative managers. The ethnicity of the family and the neighborhood, smallholder land size, distance to an agricultural cooperative, distance to the nearest local market, and distance to a motorable road are key determinants that influence cooperative membership. The analysis of the effects of cooperative membership is based on propensity score matching, controlling for a large array of household and community characteristics. The estimates imply that cooperative membership may significantly affect family net crop income, but the overall effects on total family income are modest. Agricultural cooperatives appear to be focused on financial services such as savings and credit activities but are less concerned with agricultural production, and cooperatives engage in almost no marketing activities.","[Dhakal, Dinesh] Univ Missouri, Truman Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [O'Brien, David] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Mueser, Peter] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Dhakal, D (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Truman Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",dd3cf@umsystem.edu; ObrienDJ@missouri.edu; mueserp@missouri.edu,,,,,,,86,1,1,9,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,12282,10.3390/su132112282,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112282,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1W6VC,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000806909500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Eradicating poverty is among the priorities of the national government that aims at EU candidacy and accession. Being the most dynamic among agricultural sectors, berry farming is a key agricultural activity at the national level and had been the subject of rural development interventions, including the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. This article provides evidence from the largest agricultural cooperative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to inform decision making and policy planning. The article aims at describing and analyzing the status and dynamics of poverty at the farm household level while highlighting their contributing factors, as well as at proposing possible development strategies based on the voice of local actors. Given the complexity and multifaceted features of the investigated issues, the methodological approach of this study relies on a mixed-methods research design, where the quantitative findings from the analysis of poverty status and dynamics and their contributing factors are complemented by qualitative findings from participatory activities. The results of the study pinpoint the successful contribution of the cooperative to the improvement of farmers? working conditions and market access and suggest that supporting collective action among berry farmers can be an effective rural development intervention to alleviate rural poverty and prevent poverty fallouts. To date, structural characteristics of farm holdings and households and climate and market-related conditions have significantly contributed to the farmers? poverty as well as to farmers? exposure to poverty. Furthermore, bridging the gender gap is still a challenge in Bosnia and Herzegovina which should be addressed urgently to mitigate the problem of social exclusion and to promote bottom-up innovation.","[Gava, Oriana] Council Agr Res & Agr Econ Anal, 14 Via Po, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Ardakani, Zahra] Islamic Azad Univ, Qaemshahr Branch, Dept Agr Econ, Qaemshahr, Iran; [Delalic, Adela] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Trg Oslobodenja Alija Izetbegovic 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Azzi, Nour] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Bartolini, Fabio] Univ Ferrara, Dept Chem Pharmaceut & Agr Sci, 46 Via Luigi Borsari, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Islamic Azad University; University of Sarajevo; Ghent University; University of Ferrara,"Gava, O (corresponding author), Council Agr Res & Agr Econ Anal, 14 Via Po, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",oriana.gava@crea.gov.it; ardakani.z@qaemiau.ac.ir; adela.delalic@efsa.unsa.ba; azzinour@gmail.com; fabio.bartolini@unife.it,,,,,,,116,33,35,3,39,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

This study is justified by the importance that information represents in the decision-making process of agribusiness managers. Moreover, drastic reductions in the cost of obtaining, processing and transmitting information are changing the way of doing business. In highly competitive times, increasing efficiency in the use of information and communication technology is essential to business sustainability. The methodology of the study is qualitative, because it analyzed the management reports from the last 20 years of the cooperatives operation (secondary data), which were crossed with the information obtained in the interviews (primary data) with the ICT managers of these organizations, and quantitative, because statistical analyzes and correlation tests were applied in the data. The results showed that the efficiency used in the entire production chain can yield better profitability and that the cooperatives with the highest percentage of ICT investments also have higher results in net assets.

Results: Through the modeling of structural equations, the perceptions of corporate governance agents of the researched agricultural cooperatives were analyzed, and it was found that: (i) corporate governance positively influences sustainability; (ii) the principles and values of cooperativism positively influence sustainability; (iii) the positive association between corporate governance and sustainability becomes more accentuated by the practice of the principles and values of cooperativism.Theoretical/Methodological contributions: Respect for the principles and values of cooperativism must be a priority in cooperatives that aim to maintain sustainability in the economic, environmental, and social pillars. In addition, corporate governance reduces agency conflicts between agent and cooperative (main), keeping all stakeholders satisfied with sustainability.","[Tres, Naline; Mazzioni, Sady; Magro, Cristian Bau Dal] UNOCHAPECO, Chapeco, SC, Brazil",Universidade Comunitaria Regional de Chapeco,"Tres, N; Mazzioni, S; Magro, CBD (corresponding author), UNOCHAPECO, Chapeco, SC, Brazil.",nalinetres@unochapeco.edu.br; sady@unochapeco.edu.br; crisbau@unochapeco.edu.br,,"Mazzioni, Sady/0000-0002-8976-6699",,,,,45,0,0,10,20,"UNIV BRASILIA, BUS ADM DEPT",BRASILIA,"CAMPUS DARCY RIBEIRO, BRASILIA, DF 70910-90, BRAZIL",1984-3925,,,CONTAB GEST GOV,Contab.

The producer group is the official organization of the European arable sector. The Bonusz Agro producer group was established in 2015, and its legal form is cooperative. They use cooperative principles such as the democratic decision-making process 'one member - one vote' principle for both significant and insignificant decisions, unlike some other cooperatives. The management of the cooperative is considering investing in a new industrial site. This new site will be for cleaning/drying the produce, and storing it in a new storage facility, among other things. The company currently lacks sufficient financial resources to make this investment possible. One of the obstacles to obtaining the necessary finances is the lack of collateral the organization has control over. This case study examines the investment decision. The main focus is on how the organization can enlist the contribution of all members. The most delicate part of the decision-making dilemma is that all members would have to offer some of their own assets as collateral. These assets would be part of their agricultural land, which is necessary to obtain the required external financial resources from banks.","[Mizik, Tamas] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Mizik, T (corresponding author), Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",tamas.mizik@uni-corvinus.hu,"Mizik, Tamás/AAE-3801-2019","Mizik, Tamás/0000-0003-4328-0631",Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,"The author wishes to thank Tamas Festo, the chairman of the cooperative, for his invaluable help and patience during the continuous data requests, and Earl R.

Design/methodology/approach This paper uses firm-level data from CoBank, the primary lender to agricultural cooperatives, to evaluate optimizing behavior of 77 Midwestern agricultural marketing and supply cooperatives from 2014 through 2017. The study uses the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the weak axioms of cost minimization and profit maximization to identify whether or not a cooperative is following a cost minimization and/or profit maximization objective. Findings In contrast to previous research, results provide stronger support for profit maximization as the behavioral objective of agricultural cooperatives instead of cost minimization, especially for larger cooperatives. Practical implications Traditional firm theory for investor-owned firms states that businesses seek to maximize profits. Agricultural cooperatives however, could aim to maximize profits so as to redistribute profits back to user-owners as patronage refunds. Or, they could minimize costs so as to lower cost of products sold and services provided to their user-owners. Given users-control the cooperative, knowing the primary objective of agricultural cooperatives will allow for better design of research and education programming. Originality/value Given recent changes and consolidation in the agricultural industry among farms and agricultural cooperatives, this study reexamines past work that evaluated the optimizing behavior of agricultural cooperatives. Changes in industry and the necessity to remain competitive from an agribusiness standpoint have resulted in an anticipated shift toward a profit maximizing objective. The value of this study is providing an evaluation framework, using a firm-level comprehensive dataset, that represents the cooperative system.","[Clymer, Amanda; Bowman, Whitney; Yeager, Elizabeth A.; Briggeman, Brian C.] Kansas State Univ, Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Yeager, EA (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",amclymer@ksu.edu; wbowman@ksu.edu; eyeager@ksu.edu; bbrigg@ksu.edu,,"Yeager, Elizabeth/0000-0002-4286-2659",,,,,11,0,0,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

However, critical evaluation of how and to what extent the cooperative organization's participation leads the farmer's adoption of environmentally friendly technology (EFT) is relatively unclear. Thus, to critically explore the knowledge gap, the study evaluates the effects of cooperative participation towards adopting environmentally friendly production technologies based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The key variables used in the study have been extracted from an extensive literature investigation, while the empirical data has been collected from October to December 2020 from 292 kiwi-fruit farmers within the Shaanxi province of China. Simultaneously, the partial least square of structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) tools has been utilized to craft the final assessment. The factor loadings of all three latent variables have been statistically significant and interrelated for quantifying the proposed model. The statistically proven framework portrayed that cooperative organizations' participation positively impacts and shapes behavioral factors and facilitates the adoption of environmentally friendly production technologies. The study found the social structure like China, the impacts of cooperation could be crucial. As cooperative participation is an ample predictor for facilitating environmentally friendly technologies, the government should broaden the technical supports, and agricultural extension should also provide extended training for a smooth transition of the cooperatives.","[Sarkar, Apurbo; Wang, Honhyu; Qian, Lu] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Sarkar, Apurbo; Wang, Honhyu; Qian, Lu] Northwest A&F Univ, Ind Res Inst 6, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Memon, Waqar Hussain] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 210014, Peoples R China; [Rahman, Airin] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Finance & Econ, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Rahman, Airin] Sher Bangla Agr Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Mkt, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Nanjing University of Science & Technology; Jiangsu University; Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU),"Qian, L (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",luqian@nwafu.edu.cn,"Rahman, Airin/M-2619-2015; Sarkar, Apurbo/AAO-7476-2020","Sarkar, Apurbo/0000-0001-6520-9217",National Natural Science Foundation Of China [7197030867],National Natural Science Foundation Of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by The National Natural Science Foundation Of China, grant number 7197030867.",,156,27,27,7,63,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

While most of them have been set up as agricultural service cooperatives, there is also the option of forming agricultural production cooperatives (APCs). Although both models stem from a similar long tradition, it was argued that production cooperatives were not competitive, thus having no role in agricultural development. Historically, these cooperatives were formed under specific conditions only. However, in recent years, they have been observed in villages characterised by family agriculture. Taking the example of Chongzhou County (Sichuan Province, China), this exploratory study investigates the salient conditions under which farmers voluntarily join such cooperatives. The results show that APCs still have a role to play in agricultural development after all. Certain conditions have to be met, like government support and recruitment of professional farm managers, but particularly a homogeneous membership and transparent decision-making processes.","[Zhang, Shemei] Sichuan Agr Univ, Fac Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wolz, Axel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Saale, Halle, Germany; [Ding, Ya] Univ Elect Sci & Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Wolz, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Saale, Halle, Germany.",wolz@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019",", IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Wolz, Axel/0000-0001-5842-7611",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673195],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Code 71673195).",,28,8,9,12,75,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,SEP,2020,49,3,,,,,256,263,3.0727E+13,10.1177/0030727020913283,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0030727020913283,,MAR 2020,8,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,MW5OS,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000523905900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

After the collapse of many weakly performing monopolist organizations during the 1980s and 1990s, strengthened cooperatives have emerged since the 2000s. Scholarly knowledge about the state-cooperative relations in which this revival takes place remains poor. Based on new evidence from Uganda's coffee sector, this paper discusses the political economy of Africa's cooperative revival. The authors argue that donors' and African governments' renewed support is framed in largely apolitical terms, which obscures the contested political and economic nature of the revival. In the context of neoliberal restructuring processes, state and non-state institutional support to democratic economic organizations with substantial redistributional agendas remains insufficient. The political-economic context in Ugandaand potentially elsewhere in Africacontributes to poor terms of trade for agricultural cooperatives while maintaining significant state control over some cooperative activities to protect the status quo interests of big capital and state elites. These conditions are unlikely to produce a conflict-free, substantial, and sustained revival of cooperatives, which the new promoters of cooperatives suggest is under way.","[Wedig, Karin] Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA; [Wiegratz, Jorg] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Denver; University of Leeds,"Wedig, K (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA.",karin.wedig@du.edu,,"WEDIG, KARIN/0000-0001-5426-1001",,,,,127,15,15,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The paper contributes to the understanding of (1) mechanisms and relationships inherent in the process of director selection in agricultural cooperatives (2) the administrative culture as well as the roles and authority of the actors in the process and (3) paradoxes which help us to understand tensions in director selection under the requirement of fulfilling both the performance task and the conformance task.

The authors find that a cooperative's market performance is improved when it invests in specific assets and has more safeguards, lower levels of behavioural and environmental uncertainty and higher levels of adaptation in the relationship with its member-suppliers.","[Marcos-Matas, Gustavo; Hernandez-Espallardo, Miguel] Univ Murcia, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Arcas-Lario, Narciso] Technol Univ Cartagena, Catedra Cajamar Cooperativismo Agr, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Hernández-Espallardo, M (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Empresa, Reg Campus Int Excellence,Campus Mare Nostrum, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",migher@um.es,"Matás, Gustavo Marcos/R-5052-2018","Matás, Gustavo Marcos/0000-0001-8779-0559","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER [AGL2010-22335-C03-02, AGL2010-22335-C03-03]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),The authors acknowledge the funding received from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and FEDER (Projects AGL2010-22335-C03-02 and AGL2010-22335-C03-03).,,26,12,13,3,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,JUN,2013,42,2,,,,,117,124,,10.5367/oa.2013.0123,http://dx.doi.org/10.5367/oa.2013.0123,,,8,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,AD9TR,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000333607900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The assessment focused on a unique dataset that allowed attitude coverage and strength of evaluation derived from data collected in 1993 and in 2013 to be evaluated. Explorative factor analytical methods revealed the attitude construct to be two-dimensional in both datasets, covering the domains named Commitment and Trust in both cases. Thus, the coverage of the attitude construct seemed unchanged. However, the strength of evaluation of both attitude dimensions was significantly increased. These findings have clear policy implications for agricultural cooperatives, since understanding the nature of changes in attitudes to these organizations is important for their successful development.

The research methodology includes qualitative methods: in-depth interviews, observational narrative analysis, statistical information, and literature review. The results show that the transformation of the governance structure, in accordance with the cooperative values, principles and practices, has a direct impact on the number of Bulgarian agricultural cooperatives and the members' satisfaction/ dissatisfaction. The members' satisfaction is enhanced by the fact that cooperative principles and values are applied in practical activities, which are regulated, moreover, by the law and charters of cooperatives. If all the principles are observed and used in the operational activity of the cooperative enterprise, then such a cooperative enterprise becomes more sustainable. The facts of the reduction of cooperative membership and the enterprises themselves, in this context, can be explained by their dissatisfaction.","[Sarov, Angel] Agricultural Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria",Agricultural Academy - Bulgaria,"Sarov, A (corresponding author), Agricultural Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",angelsarov@abv.bg,,,"Nacional Science Fund, Ministry of Education and Science [15/11]","Nacional Science Fund, Ministry of Education and Science","This research is conducted within the project Innovation Models for Farms Competitiveness Increase in Bulgaria financial grant from Nacional Science Fund, Ministry of Education and Science, contract... 15/11 from 18.12.2017",,17,1,1,0,2,SCIENTIFIC ISSUES NATL CENTRE AGRARIAN SCIENCES,SOFIA,"125, TSARIGRADSKO SHOSSE BUL, BLOCK 1, SOFIA, 1113, BULGARIA",1310-0351,,,BULG J AGRIC SCI,Bulg.

According to the economic theory of cooperativism, the results show that these entities come closer to the pecking order theory, i.e. policies that maximise the prices received by members to the detriment of the entity's self-financing abilities, coupled with restrictions on cooperatives' equity capital that may lead them to use debt to fund growth. The results also show positive relationships between cooperatives' indebtedness and other factors, such as investments in non-current assets, liquidity and cooperative size in terms of turnover per member.","[Mateos-Ronco, Alicia] Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Res Business Management CEGEA, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Guzman-Asuncion, Sandra] Cooperat Agroalimentaries Comunitat Valenciana, C Caballeros 26, Valencia 46001, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Mateos-Ronco, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Res Business Management CEGEA, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",amateos@cegea.upv.es,"Mateos-Ronco, Alicia/N-8803-2019","Mateos-Ronco, Alicia/0000-0002-1185-1885",,,,,54,11,11,5,29,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The purpose of this study was identifying factors affecting the development and strengthening entrepreneurship in agricultural production cooperatives in Zanjan province. A descriptive-correlation survey approach was used in this study. The study population consists of agricultural cooperative managers. Research samples was selected using randomly stratified method with using Cochrane formula ( n=165). Reliability of instruments was determined by pilot test and calculating Cronbach alpha coefficient. Cronbach alpha values were 0.82. Validity of instrument was determined by investigating the attitudes of specialists in university and cooperative office in Zanjan. Results showed that from the perspective of managers the most important factors in strengthening entrepreneurship in agricultural cooperatives are: Providing financial support and tax breaks, reform the banking laws and making regulations to adjust with entrepreneurs conditions and preparing the document of national entrepreneurship development. Results also demonstrated that there is significant relationship between the entrepreneurial scores of managers and education level of board members, the total number of cooperatives and success level of cooperatives. One-way analysis of variance showed that there is significantly different between entrepreneurial scores of agricultural cooperatives in cities in province.

This approach is applied to a database of 163 farms located in the Campos County, a region belonging to the dry lands of the Spanish Northern Plateau, using 12 individual indicators of sustainability. Our findings show that both economic and environmental composite sustainability indicators are positively correlated, but that this is not the case for the social indicator. We also check the influence of a set of variables on farm sustainability using bootstrapping statistical techniques, and showing that increasing farm size, membership in agricultural cooperatives and farmers' medium and upper agricultural-specific technical education, all exert a significant positive influence on sustainability.

However, cooperatives may not be exempt from corruption. The objective of this paper is to assess farmers' perception of corruption in the agricultural cooperative sector and to analyse if that level depends on their personal characteristics, on farm-specific characteristics, and the relations with the cooperative. With data collected through a survey, a logistic model was estimated to analyse the impact of personal characteristics of farmers and of their farms in the odd of score very high the level of corruption in the agriculture cooperative sector. Results suggest that farmers perceive high levels of corruption and that gender, age, turnover, and seniority as members of the cooperative are relevant predictors of the said level of corruption.

The results indicate that membership of either group is positively related to yield. However, cooperatives that were not engaged in marketing achieved higher TE than non-members. This suggests that policy makers should encourage cooperatives to focus on activities that do not include direct marketing to increase TE in apple production in China.","[Qu, Ruopin; Wu, Yongchang; Chen, Jing] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Jones, Glyn D.; Li, Wenjing; Jin, Shan; Frewer, Lynn J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Jones, Glyn D.; Li, Wenjing] FERA Sci Ltd, Natl Agrifood Innovat Campus, Sand Hutton YO41 1LZ, England; [Chang, Qian; Yang, Guijun] Natl Engn Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yiying] RSK ADAS Ltd, 172 Chester Rd, Helsby WA6 0AR, England; [Li, Zhenhong] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS; Newcastle University - UK; Food & Environment Research Agency; Beijing Academy of Agriculture & Forestry Sciences (BAAFS); Newcastle University - UK","Chen, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",tsqrp@126.com; wuyongchang@caas.cn; chenjing@caas.cn; glyn.d.jones@fera.co.uk; Li.Wenjiing@newcastle.ac.uk; S.Jin13@newcastle.ac.uk; changliang_2008@yeah.net; yiying.cao@adas.co.uk; guijun.yang@163.com; Zhenhong.Li@newcastle.ac.uk; lynn.frewer@newcastle.ac.uk,"Jones, Glyn/HIK-0873-2022; Li, Zhenhong/F-8705-2010","Li, Zhenhong/0000-0002-8054-7449; Qu, Ruopin/0000-0001-5508-0480; Yang, Guijun/0000-0002-6425-8321; Jin, Shan/0000-0001-7531-9997",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFE0122500],National Key Research and Development Program of China,This study is funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFE0122500).,,30,12,12,5,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,12,19,,,,,,,8194,10.3390/su12198194,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12198194,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ON1OM,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000586479500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Romania needs strong cooperatives and, in order to achieve this, the involvement of not only the authorities and agricultural producers, but also of each inhabitant from the rural area, is required. In the context of food market saturation with import products, it is necessary to revive the Romanian market in order to supply natural and quality products. A total of 1425 agricultural cooperatives were registered in Romania at the end of 2018, out of which 57% did not submit the Balance Sheet. The research performed within the study proposes the usage of fsQCA analysis in order to assess some conditions considered by us essential for the sustainability of the agricultural cooperatives. These conditions are represented by the initial contribution of the members, by the existence of a central collection space, by the employment of a manager, by the knowledge of the members on the development possibilities, and by the involvement of the members within the cooperative's activity. The study highlights the fact that the absence of the conditions presented leads to the absence of a sustainable cooperative. We consider the dissolution of the cooperatives pertinent, which has not developed an activity for more than three years from their establishment and the publication on the MADR website of the National Registry of Cooperatives, which will offer a true image on the prosperity and viability of these types of entities.","[Florea, Andrei-Mirel] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Sch Doctoral Studies Engn, Galati 800001, Romania; [Bercu, Florentin] Union Natl Branch Crop Sect Cooperat, Bucharest 020491, Romania; [Radu, Riana Iren] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Business Adm, Galati 800001, Romania; [Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Ctr Technol Transfer, Galati 800001, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati; Dunarea De Jos University Galati; Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Florea, AM (corresponding author), Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Sch Doctoral Studies Engn, Galati 800001, Romania.;Stanciu, S (corresponding author), Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Ctr Technol Transfer, Galati 800001, Romania.",floreaandreim@yahoo.com; florentin.bercu@gmail.com; raduriana@gmail.com; sstanciu@ugal.ro,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017; Florea, Andrei-Mirel/AAA-5732-2019","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968; Florea, Andrei-Mirel/0000-0001-6999-737X",Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation [14PFE/17.10.2018],"Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization - Romania)","The project Excellence, performance and competitiveness in the Research, Development and Innovation activities at Dunarea de Jos University of Galati, acronym EXPERT, financed by the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation in the framework of Programme 1 - Development of the national research and development system, Sub-programme 1.2 -Institutional Performance - Projects for financing excellence in Research, Development and Innovation, Contract no. 14PFE/17.10.2018 supported this work.",,65,11,11,1,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2019,11,21,,,,,,,5927,10.3390/su11215927,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11215927,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JT7ZZ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000501205200056,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper explores the latest state policy on the development of agricultural cooperatives in Uzbekistan through the prism of its compatibility with the existing institutional conditions. An exploratory case study approach was used to conduct interviews with representatives of key actors involved in the policy formulation at the national scale and its implementation in two pilot provinces. Applying the analytical instruments of the procedure for institutional compatibility assessment (PICA) on the one hand and based on empirical insights from in-depth interviews (n = 22) and internal policy docu-ments on the other hand, we have identified a set of crucial institutional aspects (CIAs) and their relative importance for the establishment of the cooperatives in Uzbekistan. In addition to the incompatibility of an excessively and exclusively regulatory nature of the intervention with the desired voluntary form of co-operatives' organization, we find that main sources of the policy (in-)compatibility lie within the degrees of information asymmetry, farmers' trust towards the state, and the capacity of the authorities. Although the state's top-down approach was effective at quickly establishing the cooperatives formally, most farmers were informed about the policy only symbolically, who then remained largely skeptical about its value, and considered the state responsible for its implementation. The findings highlight the need for a change in broader institutional envi-ronment and allowing time for learning and internalization of self-organization principles by farmers in order to make the economic advantages of cooperatives possible.","[Niyazmetov, Davron; Soliev, Ilkhom; Theesfeld, Insa] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, Dept Agr Environm & Food Policy, D-06099 Halle, Germany; [Niyazmetov, Davron] Tashkent Inst Irrigat & Agr Mech Engineers, 39 Qori Niyoziy St, Tashkent 100000, Uzbekistan",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Tashkent Institute of Irrigation & Agricultural Mechanization Engineers,"Niyazmetov, D (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, Dept Agr Environm & Food Policy, D-06099 Halle, Germany.",davron.niyazmetov@student.uni-halle.de; ilkhom.soliev@landw.uni-halle.de; insa.theesfeld@landw.uni-halle.de,"Niyazmetov, Davran/ABA-3877-2021; Soliev, Ilkhom/HJH-8160-2023","Soliev, Ilkhom/0000-0002-6780-2038; Theesfeld, Insa/0000-0002-0200-756X","Volkswagen Foundation, Germany [96 264]","Volkswagen Foundation, Germany(Volkswagen)","The research was conducted within the framework of the SUSADICA (Sustainable Agricultural Development in Central Asia) project funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, Germany (Grant ID: 96 264) .

This study addresses a question, does educational background and training attained has a relationship with the competency of the BOD in ensuring the effectiveness of financial reporting? Based on previous literature, competency is believed to be influenced by individual educational background and training attended. 42 cooperatives on agriculture based in the whole state of Perak were selected in this study, however only 258 questionnaires were returned. Hierarchical regression analysis technique was used, and the result shows that there is a significant relationship between education background and training attained by the BOD member with their competency in managing the agriculture cooperative society activities in state of Perak.

The aim of this study was to evaluate institutional relations and information between the various actors within the agricultural knowledge and information system (AKIS). The study focused on eight actors within the AKIS in Dakahlia governorate of Egypt, namely policy, extension, research, agricultural cooperatives, higher education, secondary education, credit, and the private sector. Thus, the survey sample included 11 representatives of each actor with 88 respondents. Data were collected by a standardized questionnaire distributed online. The graph theoretical technique was used for the quantitative assessment of information flow and institutional linkages established among actors. The findings indicated that agricultural extension ranked first about their real cause and effect on the rest of the system, having a value of 7.95. Two critical information pathways within the AKIS sustained innovation outcomes: (1) higher education-extension-agricultural cooperatives, (2) research-extension-agricultural cooperatives. The results also revealed that agricultural cooperatives ranked second after the extension component on the extent of supplying information to other members in the AKIS, with a value of 4.8. In contrast, the highest component received information from other components (7.6). By analyzing institutional linkages and information flow, this article gives insights to policymakers on the mechanisms that still need to be strengthened and the information gaps between actors to address the challenges of sustainable rural development.","[Kassem, Hazem S.] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Ismail, Hamed] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Ghoneim, Yomna A.] Mansoura Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Documentat Librarianship & Informat, Mansoura 35516, Egypt",King Saud University; University of Guelph; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University,"Kassem, HS (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",hskassem@ksu.edu.sa; ismailh@uoguelph.ca; yomna_ghoneim@mans.edu.eg,"Kassem, Hazem/AAG-9089-2020","Kassem, Hazem/0000-0001-9327-3283; Ismail, Hamed/0000-0001-6216-6282","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2021/403]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This research was funded by Researchers Supporting Project Number (RSP-2021/403), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,86,1,1,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,6415,10.3390/su14116415,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14116415,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1Z3MI,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000808732100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Responding to the economic crisis, the companies cut off investments, wages and reduced personnel. However, the companies have to adapt their business strategies to cope with the crisis. This paper conducts a strategic assessment of the Greek agricultural cooperatives during the first half of 2013 using in-depth interviews with cooperative executives in order to illustrate how they have responded to the crisis and also to investigate their strategic options for the upcoming period. The results of the analysis show that agricultural cooperatives have chosen the retrenchment and cost-cutting strategies by restraining their activities while they appear eager to export their production. In addition, the cash shortage forced them to count exclusively on their members to finance any new economic activity. According to the cooperatives' executives, their adaption strategies exclude abandoning the activities and selling the equipment and their real estate properties, while they involve exports, the experienced personnel and marketing investments. These results could provide helpful directions not only for the agricultural cooperatives' management boards but also for the food industry businesses operating under a severe economic situation such as the present Greek economic crisis.","[Kontogeorgos, Achilleas] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, G Seferi 2,PO 30100, Agrinion, Greece; [Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios; Loizou, Efstratios] Technol Educ Inst Western Macedonia, Div Agr Econ, Dept Agr Technol, Florina, Greece",University of Patras,"Kontogeorgos, A (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, G Seferi 2,PO 30100, Agrinion, Greece.",akontoge@upatras.gr,"Loizou, Efstratios/CAC-9240-2022; Loizou, Efstratios/AAJ-9792-2021; Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/E-3450-2017; Loizou, Efstratios/S-4313-2019","Loizou, Efstratios/0000-0002-9779-0226; Loizou, Efstratios/0000-0002-9779-0226; Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/0000-0003-2008-1023; Kontogeorgos, Achilleas/0000-0002-4186-0379",,,,,36,7,7,0,23,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach A typology of agricultural cooperatives' potential for multirational management in relation to corporate governance is proposed. Coordinates based on data from assembly participation and separation of ownership and control are used to map cooperatives among these typologies. Four case studies representing each typology were conducted, allowing analysis of propositions. Findings By mapping the cooperatives from Mato Grosso do Sul, a reduced potential for multirational management is noted. By analyzing the four case studies, coded as Coop 1, 3, 13 and 16, this study found convergence with P1, P2 and P3. Coop 1 shows signs of adopting exploitation practice. In Coop 3, evidence points to avoidance practice and, analyses of Coop 13 indicates adoption of tolerance practice. In Coop 16, however, P4 could not be confirmed. Instead of polarizing practices, there is evidence of avoidance practice. Therefore, a positive relation between corporate governance and multirational management can partially be observed. Originality/value There are no records of a paper that has explored the relation of governance and multirational management. Therefore, this research broadens the understanding of how corporate governance can function in the context of cooperative organizations. As well, insight is given on how different mechanisms of corporate governance can influence organizations to adopt explicit or implicit and monorational or multirational methods of dealing with multiple rationalities.","[Teixeira, Maisa Gomide] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Sch Adm & Business, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Caleman, Silvia Morales de Queiroz; Americo, Jean Carlos] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Sch Business & Management, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso,"Teixeira, MG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Sch Adm & Business, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",85maisatx@gmail.com; silviacaleman@gmail.com; jean_americo@hotmail.com,,"Morales de Queiroz Caleman, Silvia/0000-0001-7560-5141",,,,,37,4,4,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1472-0701,1758-6054,,CORP GOV-INT J BUS S,Corp.

Agricultural cooperatives, as a form of joint work, have appeared as a necessity of the economically burdened communities and then developed into strong and influential organizations that give social and economic stability in developed countries and offer hopes and solutions in developing countries. Yet, their development and popularisation has been hindered by several factors, including political regimes such as socialism, fascism or communism, which left many people with trust issues regarding this form of organisation. Recently, the agricultural cooperatives have caught wings among both authorities and farmers and spread all around the world and in all kind of fields. In this case, the author wanted to find out if the media has a role in this sudden popularization of a two hundred years old form of organization, and if there are any other implications for the media's involvement. For this purpose, the linguistics borrowed discourse analysis methodology was used. The results show that media articles do not only have the role of spreading information, as one would assume, but a more important one. Since the media articles have a legislative and scientific base, with a familiar vocabulary, they turn out to be intermediaries, familiar interfaces between authorities and farmers, putting the policies into more accessible words.","[Diaconeasa, Maria Claudia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Diaconeasa, MC (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mariaclaudia.diaconeasa@gmail.com,"Diaconeasa, Maria Claudia/AAP-1430-2021; Diaconeasa, Maria Claudia/K-6501-2019","Diaconeasa, Maria Claudia/0000-0002-7406-7879",,,,,14,0,0,0,3,SOC ROMANA PENTRU ASIGURAREA CALITATII,BUCHAREST,"STR VASILE PARVAN NR 14, SECTOR 1, POSTAL CODE 010 216, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",1582-2559,,,QUAL-ACCESS SUCCESS,Qual.-Access Success,MAR,2018,19,,,1,,,202,207,,,,,,6,Management,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,GJ6KP,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000435493100035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Electoral explanations provide part of the answer; candidates in elections to both houses of the Diet continue to face incentives many of them unintended to court the organized vote. But missing from such accounts is an explanation of why economically noncompetitive groups provide the bulk of such support. The primary reason for this, I argue, is organization. As a result of their historical linkages to the bureaucracy, many interests developed hierarchical, national organizational structures that enabled them to carry out a variety of vote-gathering functions that the parties had trouble performing themselves. Although electoral reform and long-term demographic trends have weakened the electoral influence of interest groups, these organizational complementarities between groups and the parties continue to matter in Japanese elections including under conditions of two-party competition. To illustrate these points, I trace the evolution of interest group politics from the era of LDP dominance through the rise of two-party competition and the LDP's recent return to power, using postmasters associations and agricultural cooperatives as case studies.","Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Maclachlan, PL (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,51,11,11,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1598-2408,2234-6643,,J EAST ASIAN STUD,J.

The consumer groups were called skeptics, cooperative, passively sensitive, and indifferent. According to the results, in general, participants considered cooperative food products as a safe choice with excellent value for money and contributing to the local society, economy, and sustainability. Segmentation could allow agricultural cooperatives to focus only on those segments of consumers that are willing to pay for cooperative products by allocating all available resources in serving them.

However, the success of these cooperatives depends on their ability to maintain their social capital, which is at the core of collective action. A few studies have addressed issues of member participation, commitment, and trust, yet less is known about rural cooperatives in developing countries as a social organization. It is also unclear whether a relationship exists between cooperative size and the incidence of conflict, fraud, and distrust. Using unique data collected from 511 agricultural cooperatives in 12 districts of Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of cooperative size on conflict, fraud, and distrust. We used instrumental variables (IV) probit estimation techniques, accounting for endogeneity of membership size, to confirm that cooperative size does affect the occurrence of conflict, fraud, and trust. The results also indicate that other influencing factors include: cooperative age, number of employees, payment of dividends based on transaction volume, and heterogeneity of member goals.","[Sebhatu, Kifle T.; D'Haese, Marijke] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Sebhatu, Kifle T.; Gezahegn, Tafesse W.; Berhanu, Tekeste] Mekelle Univ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 451, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Maertens, Miet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200e, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Van Passel, Steven] Univ Antwerp, Dept Engn Management, Antwerp, Belgium",Ghent University; Mekelle University; KU Leuven; University of Antwerp,"Sebhatu, KT (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",kifletesfamariam@gmail.com,"Maertens, Miet/A-5509-2013","Maertens, Miet/0000-0001-7245-0375; Van Passel, Steven/0000-0002-6971-9246; D'Haese, Marijke/0000-0002-0544-3420",VLIR-UOS Belgium [ZEIN2015PR406 (13V95615T)],VLIR-UOS Belgium,"The authors would like to thank the office of the twelve districts, facilitators and Cooperative Promotion Agency staff for their collaboration in facilitating the field survey, most of all the chair-and vice-chairpersons of the study Agricultural Cooperatives who had to respond to all our questions with seriousness and patience.

Such cooperatives make a trade-off between the return on investment in quality and members' disengagement from the cooperative. Based on data from the five-year survey of small French agricultural cooperatives, we analyse the effect of incentive payments on small cooperatives' performances. We investigate how incentive payments can reduce the problem of free riders and improve these cooperatives' reputation. Using a quantile regression method, while controlling for the potential endogeneity of incentive payments, we show that quality-based compensation can rule out cooperative members' defrauding options. This remuneration has a non-linear positive effect on small cooperatives' performances.

Although the consensus from the literature suggests that participating in these organizations significantly affects farm production, there is inconclusive evidence on whether this effect is positive or negative. Moreover, previous studies solely focus on the magnitude of this effect and fail to explain the mechanism behind it. This study contributes to this knowledge gap by estimating the impact of agricultural cooperatives on farm profits. To do this, we apply the causal mediation analysis to explain the potential mechanism behind this relationship. Using a nationally representative survey of farm households from Taiwan in 2013, we find that participating in cooperatives increases farm profits. Furthermore, this effect is more pronounced for producers with higher profits. Concerning the mechanism, we find that the use of food labels accounts for approximately 15 to 28% of the total effect of cooperative participation on farm profits.","[Wang, Bo] Fuzhou Univ Int Studies & Trade, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350202, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Po-Yuan] Taipei City Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Leisure & Recreat Management, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Lee, Brian; Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Sun, Lih-Chyun] Univ Taipei City, Dept Urban Ind Management & Mkt, Taipei 11153, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chang, HH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,,Fulbright Taiwan (Foundation for Scholarly Exchange),Fulbright Taiwan (Foundation for Scholarly Exchange),The authors would like to thank the Council of Agriculture for making the individual farm level data available.

The cooperative sector, although guided by principles of solidarity, democratic control, member economic participation, mutualism and transparency, may not be free from corruption. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the perception of corrupt and similar practices in agricultural cooperatives in Northern Portugal by its members, their perception of corruption in the agricultural sector, and if this perception is different according to their socio-demographic profile, business characteristics and relationships with the cooperative. Additionally, it is intended to group cooperators according to their level of perceived corruption and investigate the characteristics of these clusters. Through the results of a survey, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses followed by a cluster analysis were performed. The results suggest that cooperators have dissatisfaction with the quality of management and alerts for the existence of corruption. Differences in the level of perceived corruption may be more due to differences in the dimension of their farms, family involvement, the dependency of the cooperative and seniority as a member than to their socio-demographic characteristics. It was possible to find three significant distinct clusters of members according to their opinion about corruption. Although the importance of agricultural cooperatives and the nobility of the principles of the cooperative movement, this article warns of ethical failures that can have the consequent reputational loss.","[Castro, Conceicao] Polytech Inst Porto, Porto Accounting & Business Sch, CEPESE, CEOSPP ISCAP PPORTO, Sao Mamede de Infesta, Portugal; [Moreira, Tiago] Polytech Inst Cavado & Ave, Lugar Do Aldao, Vila Frescainha, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Castro, C (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Porto, Porto Accounting & Business Sch, CEPESE, CEOSPP ISCAP PPORTO, Sao Mamede de Infesta, Portugal.",mariacastro@iscap.ipp.pt; tiagomanuelmoreira82@gmail.com,"Moreira, Tiago AS/I-4266-2016; Castro, Conceicao/Q-1326-2016","Moreira, Tiago AS/0000-0002-5880-1754; Castro, Conceicao/0000-0002-1550-5867",,,,,24,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-3-3,,,,2019,,,,,,,9727,9738,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP7AN,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000561117203063,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is important that members of a cooperative are committed to a customer-oriented strategy, otherwise vertical coordination can be costly and the loss of autonomy at the farm level might negatively affect the members commitment to collective action. In this context, how can both types of commitment be strengthened? This study decomposes the membercooperative relationship into four organizational mechanismsmarket, hierarchy, community and democracy, which all play a role in generating commitment. Data originate from 148 farmers, all members of the same agricultural cooperative in Brazil. The results suggest first, that it is possible to disentangle commitment to collective action from commitment to a customer-oriented strategy. Second, although members commitment to a customer-oriented strategy might be affected by market and hierarchy mechanisms only, commitment to collective action might depend on the four organizational mechanisms.

Since the operational cycle of these organizations demands a positive net working capital that is usually funded by debt, the authors examine whether this rise in sales was obtained at the cost of the short-term financial sustainability. As a matter of comparison, the authors conduct the same analysis for Brazilian agricultural public traded companies. Design/methodology/approach The authors employ the dynamic analysis of working capital method to measure the short-term financial sustainability of these organizations. Findings The authors find that the expansion of net working capital caused by the growth of the revenues of the sampled cooperatives was mostly funded by short-term debt, which rose by 31% in annualized terms. The authors also document that around 60% of these firms displayed a current capital structure that can be considered risky in terms of indebtedness, and that the majority of firms exhibited a non-sustainable growth in the period, what contrasts with the performance presented by Brazilian agricultural publicly traded companies, since only 16% of the firms from this group have shown a non-sustainable growth. This distinction seems to be explained by the lower capacity of agricultural cooperatives to provide resources from their operations. Originality/value The authors investigate the short-term financial sustainability of a unique dataset of 65 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives and provide insight for researchers analyzing the dual nature of these firms.","[Piccoli, Pedro; Bianchini Junior, Nilton; Coser, Jeferson; Moreira, Vilmar R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana,"Piccoli, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",pedro.r.piccoli@gmail.com; niltonbianchiniint@gmail.com; jefcoser@gmail.com; vilmar.moreira@pucpr.br,"Moreira, Vilmar Rodrigues/P-1315-2018","Moreira, Vilmar Rodrigues/0000-0003-1796-6752",,,,,30,4,4,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

Multiproduct scale and scope economies are found that suggests increasing scale and product diversification can reduce cost for agricultural cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives experience economies of scale indicating that variable returns to scale as opposed to constant returns to scale is the appropriate technology for modeling agricultural cooperatives. Product-specific scale economies for all outputs are close to one indicating that individual outputs are operating close to constant returns to scale. Annual frontier estimates show that cooperatives have become less cost efficient over time, but scale and scope economies remain relatively consistent across years. Further, results show that economic measures obtained from the single frontier are statistically different from those measures calculated from annual frontiers, suggesting that the cost frontier has shifted over time. The trade-off between cost efficiency and multiproduct scale economies indicates that smaller cooperatives can reduce a higher percentage of cost by increasing the scale of operations rather than just becoming cost efficient. Because larger incentives exist for small cooperatives to increase scale, mergers will likely continue until economies of scale are exhausted in the industry.","[Pokharel, Krishna P.] Fed Energy Regulatory Commiss, Washington, DC 20426 USA; [Featherstone, Allen M.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Pokharel, KP (corresponding author), Fed Energy Regulatory Commiss, Washington, DC 20426 USA.",kpokharel7@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,14,14,4,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice-producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

An ordinary least square regression was employed to analyse the effects of member size and selective incentives of agricultural cooperatives on product quality. Findings - The empirical results show that member size and cooperative's product quality bear an inverse U-shape relationship, and food safety certification and target market variables tend to positively and significantly influence cooperative's product quality. In particular, the cooperatives with more food safety certificates and targeting supermarkets and export enterprises are more likely to supply high-quality products.

In addition to the so-called property rights problems (e. g., free-rider, horizon, and portfolio problems), the analysis of agricultural cooperatives has focused on issues of market power, agency, product quality, and increasingly producer and consumer heterogeneity. These last three elements are important features of the industrialization of the agrifood system. This article highlights the key concepts required for examination of cooperatives now and in the future and incorporates these concepts into a framework that can be used to examine the myriad situations and problem settings in which agricultural cooperatives are likely to be found. A key finding of the paper is that the procompetitive and distributional impacts of cooperatives depend critically on the sensitivity of price in the downstream retail market, the nature of the cooperative's governance structure, and the open or closed nature of cooperative membership. The article also provides a discussion of new areas in which an understanding of cooperatives and collective action would be valuable, as well as a discussion of the applicability of the proposed framework to these areas.","[Fulton, Murray] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada; [Giannakas, Konstantinos] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Saskatchewan; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Fulton, M (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada.",Murrray.Fulton@usask.ca; kgiannakas@unl.edu,,"Giannakas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3628-2869; Fulton, Murray/0000-0002-0351-5531",,,,,93,26,28,1,50,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Using primary data from a field survey of cattle farmers in China, this paper empirically examines the impact of policy cognition on livestock farmers' investment in manure recycling facilities. The impact is tested through the multiple mediator model to accommodate two potential mediating mechanisms, which are the agricultural cooperative membership and land leasing. Three conclusions arise. First, policy cognition has a significant posi-tive impact on both the diversification and amounts of farmers' investment in manure recycling facilities. Second, membership in agricultural cooperatives and participation in land leasing are two important mediating mecha-nisms for policy cognition to affect farmers' investment decisions on manure recycling. Finally, for the two medi-ating variables, leasing additional agricultural land promotes more investment in manure recycling facilities, but less in investment diversification, while cooperative membership has the opposite impact. This study contributes to three areas of literature on the factors affecting investment decisions, the mediating effects of policy cognition and the investment in non-production related assets. Regarding policy implications, we identify the importance of promoting policy awareness and agricultural cooperatives among livestock farmers, as well as developing land lease markets in agricultural regions in promoting investment in manure recycling facilities.

The answer to this question determined and/or legitimized the rationale for the legislative framework concerning their post-socialist transformation. This analysis draws mainly on data from the parliamentary debates that preceded the enactment of three pivotal laws. In comparing the debates in 1991/1992 and 1995, the examination focuses on the shift in the argumentation put forward by representatives speaking on behalf of cooperative farms. A dramatic shift in reasoning about the character of cooperative enterprises and appropriate voting rights is interpreted as a pragmatic, effect-oriented action. It is argued that both delicate work with the hybrid nature of post-socialist cooperative farms as well as the initial withholding of cooperative principles contributed to the preservation of the specific kinds of agricultural cooperative, and consequently also large corporate farm, which now exist in Slovakia.",,,,,,,,,,,20,6,6,0,9,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU MIKOLAJA KOPERNIKA,TORUN,"UL.

It even is the key for cooperative competitiveness. Active membership, however, decreases in many cooperatives. Thus, it is important to know what galvanizes members to become active members. The cooperative's value and the cooperative's offers motivate some members to become active members, but certainly not all of them. Therefore, more work needs to be done to understand the social attributes that transform members into active members. In this paper the incentives that sustain members' participation over time and the contribution of members' active participation in the cooperative's competitive advantage are studied. Empirical evidence is provided via a questionnaire completed by 241 cooperative members of a Dutch feed supply cooperative and interviews with cooperative experts. Results show that active membership builds on social attributes, such as cooperative culture, open communication, trust, involvement, and the willingness to be active. It is explained that these social attributes create benefits for both the cooperative and its members. Finally, suggestions are presented to stimulate active cooperative membership.","[Verhees, Frans J. H.

This heterogeneity, coupled with a large growth in the number of cooperatives in the country, offers an interesting perspective to study the determinants of the (in)efficiency of cooperatives. In this paper, we analyse the performance of Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives, focusing on the degree of technical (in)efficiency and its determinants. We use the stochastic frontier approach in which we account for heteroskedasticity and the monotonicity of production functions, presenting a methodological improvement with respect to previous technical efficiency studies. The results show that NGO- and government-initiated cooperatives are less efficient than community-initiated ones, implying that governments and NGOs should not interfere too strongly in cooperative formation. Cooperatives with a high degree of heterogeneity in members' participation are found to be about 98% less efficient, while cooperatives that have paid employees are 33% more efficient. Besides, results show that cooperatives in Ethiopia function more efficiently if they incentivize committee members through monetary compensation.","[Gezahegn, Tafesse W.; Maertens, Miet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Gezahegn, Tafesse W.; Berhanu, Tekeste] Mekelle Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Box 451, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Van Passel, Steven] Univ Antwerp, Dept Engn Management, Antwerp, Belgium; [D'haese, Marijke] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium",KU Leuven; Mekelle University; University of Antwerp; Ghent University,"Gezahegn, TW (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.;Gezahegn, TW (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Box 451, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",tafpeace@gmail.com,"Gezahegn, Tafesse W./I-5182-2019; Maertens, Miet/A-5509-2013","Gezahegn, Tafesse W./0000-0001-5052-8442; Maertens, Miet/0000-0001-7245-0375; Van Passel, Steven/0000-0002-6971-9246; D'Haese, Marijke/0000-0002-0544-3420","VLIR-UOS TEAM Program, Belgium [VLIR-UOS-ZEIN2015PR406 (13V95615T)]","VLIR-UOS TEAM Program, Belgium","The authors acknowledge funding from the VLIR-UOS TEAM Program (VLIR-UOS-ZEIN2015PR406 (13V95615T), Belgium.",,64,8,8,7,29,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,JAN 2,2020,59,1,,,,,93,109,,10.1080/03031853.2019.1663223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2019.1663223,,SEP 2019,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,KO5EN,,Green Submitted,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000487651200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model considers management decisions of heterogonous producers within an intertemporal framework, with the decision to join the cooperative assumed to be endogenous. Farm-level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures.","[Ma, Wanglin] Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany; [Goetz, Renan] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona, Spain",Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Kiel; Universitat de Girona,"Abdulai, A (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019; Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021; Goetz, Renan/G-3158-2015","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459; Goetz, Renan/0000-0002-4672-8502; , Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",German Research Foundation (DFG); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Spain [ECO2016-75927-R],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Spain(Spanish Government),Awudu Abdulai acknowledges the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG).

However, cooperatives are rarely included in this line of research. This paper aims to analyze how IC in agrifood cooperatives influences their prominence by fostering responsible research and innovation (RRI), reputation and performance. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model was developed based on a literature review, and a quantitative study was conducted, including a representative sample of the current most prominent Spanish agrifood cooperatives. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the validity of constructs, path relationships and recent advances in the predictive model assessment. Findings This study's findings show the specific role of human capital (HC) for enhancing social and structural capital in cooperatives. It was concluded that there is a need to revise and reconsider the role-played by IC in the cooperative movement. Research limitations/implications - The main practical contribution is to offer a specific vision of IC for agrifood cooperatives in order to maximize their market prominence. Since the study was conducted in Spain and based on a cross-sectional research approach, even though the new methodological tool partial least squares (PLS) predict was used, the authors cannot affirm whether IC will have the long-term expected effects as assumed in this research and in all contexts of the agrifood industry. Originality/value - This is the first empirical study that has examined IC in agrifood cooperatives in Spain, with attention focused on the role of HC as a predictor of market success.","[Sanchez-Hernandez, M.

An improved understanding of the key drivers underpinning the performance of cooperatives is important for informing government programmes and policies that target cooperatives. This study examined the financial efficiency, and its determinants, of 387 agricultural cooperatives in South Africa, using the Simar-Wilson methodology. Bias-corrected Data Envelopment Analysis estimates for financial efficiency were obtained in the first stage. The results indicated that many agricultural cooperatives are relatively inefficient, compared to the three best-performing cooperatives on the efficient boundary. In the second stage, a double bootstrap truncated regression model was used to obtain bias-corrected scores that excluded the best-performing cooperatives. The statistically significant efficiency determinants identified from the analysis were the age and size of the cooperative, the gender of the principal manager of the cooperative, its governance and the training indicators. The observed relationship between governance and efficiency may be attributed to institutions that prioritise non-financial goals by being relatively more willing to compromise on governance quality. Furthermore, deviations from sound institutional control mechanisms are more likely to emerge in cooperatives that have weak institutional and organisational arrangements.","[Yobe, C. L.; Ferrer, S.

Nearly ten percent of the respondents used other ICT applications such as WhatsApp (7.33 percent) and Facebook (11.33 percent) for seeking agricultural information. It was also found that pesticide dealers and private companies' representatives were the major sources for seeking information by respondents. Majority of the respondents (82.00 percent) were members of agricultural co-operative societies in their villages. Farm literature, TV telecast and radio broadcasts were some other information sources utilized by the Bt cotton farmers in Punjab state. It was also found that area and productivity of Bt cotton at the fields of respondents started decreasing gradually due to decreased yields, price fluctuations, leading to lower gross income of the respondents.

However, research on the observed survival of farmer cooperatives in spite of their weaknesses and limitations is scarce, in part because academic attention to cooperative performance has been static and introspective. Using evidence collected from case studies and print media publications, this paper contributes to the literature with a qualitative study of farmer cooperatives which spurred survival and longevity by means of strategic adaptation in response to four current developments in the external environment: industry consolidation, consumer segmentation, price volatility, and policy change. The qualitative study concludes farmer cooperatives in general respond to such developments by means of organizational growth. Common strategies are vertical integration, geographic expansion, and portfolio diversification. While survival and longevity are promoted in theory, strategic adaptation also often facilitates the pursuit of investor-oriented as opposed to user-oriented objectives. In some scenarios, member ownership and control may become burdensome to the business and prompt conversion to another structure if further adaptation to internal and external developments is unsuccessful. More research is therefore needed to explore the dynamic and variable impact of strategy on cooperative survival.","[Grashuis, Jasper] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Grashuis, J (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grashuisj@missouri.edu,,"Grashuis, Jasper/0000-0002-5075-4439",,,,,83,26,27,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2018,10,3,,,,,,,652,10.3390/su10030652,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10030652,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA8DA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000428567100079,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this case, the cooperative acts as a mechanism for rural development. The defining feature is that the mechanism of integrated development of rural territory to provide a comprehensive solution to the problems of the economy of the area and settlement, the formation and increase of investment attractiveness of the territory of the rural settlement and the creation of a working climate for private business are agricultural cooperatives. Analyzing the state of cooperation in the context of the European integration tendencies, which currently permeate the agrarian sector of the Ukrainian economy, studying the experience of cooperation among farmers of the European countries can be useful both from the point of view of its adaptation to domestic realities, and from the point of view of the most significant mistakes in development and miscalculations in rural areas. In addition, marketing studies have been conducted in rural areas of Ukraine, which have revealed the most significant areas of rural settlement development, including the creation and development of enterprises of meat, construction, tourism and recreational clusters and the development of joint ventures as growth points that activate the development of small and medium-sized businesses around them and the formation of interregional ties and rural cooperatives. Methods. Creating an agricultural consumer supply cooperative is the most effective mechanism for developing identified growth points and creating infrastructure to support them in rural Ukraine. The basis for the construction of an agricultural cooperative in rural areas is the formation of a model of maximum cost reduction for all members of the cooperative. Results. The further development and effective management of the cooperatives will contribute to solving socio-economic problems, improving the well-being of the peasants and, as a consequence, ensuring the integrated development of rural areas. Value/originality. Analyzing the activities of agricultural cooperatives operating in the world, we point out that research on the institutional foundations of the cooperative and its functioning as a mechanism of economic self-regulation give reason to claim that the cooperative does not have sufficient state support for its development. As a consequence, the number of cooperatives is steadily decreasing, we believe that the cooperative system of interaction of economic agents in the agricultural sector should include nationwide programmatic measures on institutional adaptation of cooperation as a mechanism of market self-regulation, a special form of integration, institutional mechanism for regulating entrepreneurship and the basis of cooperation, rules, traditions, organizations and institutions, the task of which is to determine the behavior of economic entities for the sake of satisfaction individual and social goals in the system of production and exchange of goods and services.","[Shpykuliak, Oleksandr] Inst Agr Econ, Natl Sci Ctr, Kiev, Ukraine; [Sakovska, Olena] Uman Natl Univ Hort, Uman, Ukraine",National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine; National Scientific Center Institute of Agrarian Economics; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Uman National University of Horticulture,"Shpykuliak, O (corresponding author), Inst Agr Econ, Natl Sci Ctr, Kiev, Ukraine.",shpykuliak@ukr.net; sakovska_lena@ukr.net,"Sakovska, Olena/AAD-7646-2019","Sakovska, Olena/0000-0003-2676-6170; Spikulak, Oleksandr/0000-0001-5257-5517",,,,,18,3,3,3,19,BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES,RIGA,"VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA",2256-0742,2256-0963,,BALT J ECON STUD,Balt.

To meet the objective, questionnaires were applied to the entity's managers in order to seek evidence of the use of the proposed models. An informal conversation was held in sequence in order to understand the familiarity with the procedures studied. The results demonstrate that the institution's managers use concepts from the two performance evaluation models. However, they are not used in a standardized way by all managers, that is, they are used in some sectors and not in others. Still, it was found that these tools complement each other in the performance evaluation process in the analyzed cooperative, but that this use is instinctive, as soon as they demonstrated ignorance of the institutionalized use of the models.","[Back, Bruna; Parizotto dos Santos, Thais Luiza; Martins, Vinicius Abilio] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana UNIOESTE, Av Tarquinio Joslin Santos 1300, BR-85870650 Foz Do Iguacu, PR, Brazil",Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana,"Back, B (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Oeste Parana UNIOESTE, Av Tarquinio Joslin Santos 1300, BR-85870650 Foz Do Iguacu, PR, Brazil.",bruna-back@hotmail.com; thaisluizaparizotto@hotmail.com; vinicius.martins@unioeste.br,"Back, Birger Bo/HNJ-0186-2023; , B/HZK-8896-2023",,,,,,38,0,0,0,2,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2022,18,1,,,,,149,172,,,,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,3D6BV,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000829385900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, we were interested in a better understanding of how farmers viewed the social benefits associated with cooperation. These social benefits have the potential to become valuable sources of social capital. Four valid and reliable measures of social benefits were identified. Social benefits that farmers may use to get by (bonding networks) had two dimensions: emotional support and social support. Social benefits that farmers may use to get ahead (bridging networks) also had two dimensions: tangible and intangible resource sharing. The desire to gain these social benefits from cooperation (except for emotional support) emerged as strong predictors of farmers' willingness to cooperate in a proposed new agricultural cooperative. Surprisingly, the expected economic benefits of cooperation did not have a significant effect on willingness to cooperate. Implications and suggestions for future research and cooperative development and management are also discussed.","[Morrow, J.

The cooperation passes through several levels of development - information, consultation, joint action, collective decision-making. The cooperation within farmers (horizontal cooperation) is so far narrow and limited to traditional cooperatives that bring together producers of the same product. New forms of cooperation and more diverse directions in national, regional and local levels are needed to develop the bioeconomy.

Different peculiarities distinguish our problem from the general Vehicle Routing Problem because there exists a type of time window constraint, truck capacity is limited, trucks are compartmentalized, there are access restrictions for trucks to some farms and our problem has the main objective of maximizing the amount of feed distributed every day and an auxiliary criterion of minimizing the transport costs. We present a mathematical programming formulation of the model that represents the logistics management problem. As solving the exact model is computationally expensive, we opt for a hybrid heuristic approach that first uses an insertion heuristic algorithm to obtain an initial solution and then improvement processes are performed using the so-called simulated annealing metaheuristic. We have built a graphical interface that allows easy use of the system and, in particular, efficient post-optimality analysis. Moreover, this interface can easily interface with other management tools. The utility of our model is shown with real and simulated data sets.","[Guitian de Frutos, Roque M.; Casas-Mendez, Balbina] Fac Math, Campus Vida S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Casas-Mendez, Balbina] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Stat Math Anal & Optimizat, Modestya Res Grp, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Casas-Mendez, Balbina] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Inst Math IMAT, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Casas-Méndez, B (corresponding author), Fac Math, Campus Vida S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",balbina.casas.mendez@usc.es,"Méndez, Balbina Virginia Casas/K-8747-2014","Méndez, Balbina Virginia Casas/0000-0002-2826-218X","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [MTM2014-53395-C3-2-P, MTM2017-87197-C3-3-P]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (MTM2014-53395-C3-2-P, MTM2017-87197-C3-3-P).",,30,3,3,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1471-678X,1471-6798,,IMA J MANAG MATH,IMA J.

We include unique features of co-ops into an analytical model and derive some key results that are different from those for investor-owned corporations. Methodology: In the presence of yield and market uncertainty, we model this situation using a Markov decision process wherein the decisions of processing quantity interact with the financial decisions of retained earnings and short-term loans. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the aggregated farmers' payments over a finite horizon. Results: (1) Characterization of the properties of the value function and the optimal policy; (2) explicit expressions for the deterministic yield dynamic program, wherein a myopic policy is optimal; and (3) identification of financial risks associated with uncertain market and yield.

They may increase women's active participation and, thereby, increase the benefits of cooperative membership. This paper reviews relevant literature and studies the effect of gender homogeneity on women's active participation. We apply a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to a sample of ten Indian village-level dairy cooperatives. The results from our comparative case study confirm that gender homogeneity is not a sufficient means to ensure active participation.

Further, the special attributes of fresh agriculture products and unpredictable emergencies make agricultural supply chain likely subject to supply chain disruption risk, and these disruptions are extreme, although occurring with low frequencies, which leads to the shortage of downstream enterprises and customers, even severely reduces the performance of whole agricultural supply chain. The paper studies on the supply disruption risk problem faced by the supermarket's purchasing. Assume a two-level option-based agricultural supply chain, which is consisted of the agricultural cooperative and the supermarket. Through numerical examples, compare the performance of different purchasing strategies (single, traditional dual, dual based on option contracts) under the setting of supply disruptions. The results show which under the supply disruption, the dual sourcing outperforms the single sourcing; the dual sourcing with option contracts brings flexibility, and maximizes the profit of the supermarket, which is the better purchasing strategy to prevent and avoid the disruption of a supply chain, providing decision-making reference for supermarket.","[Yang, Xiangfei; Du, Gu; Li, Mengna] Lanzhou Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",Lanzhou Jiaotong University,"Yang, XF (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",,"?, ?/HGC-6534-2022",,Provincial Science Foundation for Young Scholars of Gansu Provincial Science and Technology Department [1508RJYA103]; Research Foundation for Yong Scholars of Lanzhou Jiao tong University [2013035],Provincial Science Foundation for Young Scholars of Gansu Provincial Science and Technology Department; Research Foundation for Yong Scholars of Lanzhou Jiao tong University,"This paper is supported by Provincial Science Foundation for Young Scholars of Gansu Provincial Science and Technology Department with project number: 1508RJYA103, and Research Foundation for Yong Scholars of Lanzhou Jiao tong University with project number: 2013035.",,15,1,1,2,34,FOUNDATION ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION & RESEARCH-FEPR,BASMANE KONAK-IZMIR,"MURESELPASA BULVARI 1265 SOKAK 10-10, H MEVLUT SUSUZLU IS MERKESI, PK 63, BASMANE KONAK-IZMIR, 35230, TURKEY",1300-1361,,,EKOLOJI,Ekoloji,,2019,28,107,,,,,4697,4704,UNSP e107527,,,,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HP4WZ,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000461678300526,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach - An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used. Findings - The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers' IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. Practical implications - The findings indicate that agricultural cooperatives can be a transmission route in the efforts to proliferate the adoption and diffusion of IPM technology, and increased IPM adoption tends to improve the economic performance of farm households. Originality/value - Despite the widespread evidence of health and environmental benefits associated with IPM technology, the adoption rate of this technology remains significantly low. This paper provides a first attempt by investigating to what extent and how agricultural cooperative membership affects IPM adoption and how IPM adoption influences farm economic performance.","[Ma, Wanglin] Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany",Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Kiel,"Ma, WL (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch, New Zealand.",Wanglin.Ma@lincoln.ac.nz,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021; Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459; , Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,34,81,89,14,76,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

From this target population, 176 managers of cooperatives were selected by multi-stage cluster sampling. A questionnaire was developed to determine the technical, economical, educational, legal, social, and policy making mechanisms that presented the collaborative networking model. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by experts in the field of Agricultural cooperative. To calculate the reliability coefficient of the questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which is used for multi-scale questions, was used. The mean of Cronbach's alpha coefficients in this study was 0.803. The results showed that policy making with a coefficient of 0.539, economic with a coefficient of 0.499, legal with a coefficient of 0.208, and educational mechanisms with a coefficient of 0.130 had the most impact, while technical and social mechanisms had no role in developing the collaborative networking.","[Alimohammad, Mohammad; Hosseini, Seyed Jamal Farajallah; Mirdamadi, Seyed Mehdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Dehyouri, Sahar] Islamic Azad Univ, Islamshahr Branch, Agr Extens & Educ, Islamshahr, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Hosseini, SJF (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran.",jamalfhosseini@srbiau.ac.ir,"dehyouri, sahar -/C-9390-2016","dehyouri, sahar -/0000-0001-9447-3762",,,,,44,0,0,3,3,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,NOV,2022,8,11,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,8L1EK,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000923531700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

It happens because the more the organisation acquires and disseminates stakeholder intelligence, the more it will be aware of the needs of different stakeholder groups, bending the decision making towards less powerful stakeholders and creating social performance. At the same time, more stakeholder intelligence is a strategic resource to be exploited favouring the economic performance. Moreover, it is proposed this effect is mediated by social motivations. Design/methodology/approach In all, 251 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives were sampled and a survey primary data collection method was applied. To test our hypothesis, the partial least squares structural equation modelling method is used. Findings It is found that SO positively influences social and economic performances. Social motivation mediates the relationship between SO and social performance. Originality/value Social performance has gained importance because strategies harmful to society are not acceptable anymore and because of the link with economic performance. However, the strategic marketing literature is still scant on how marketing can drive economic and social performance at the same time.","[von der Osten, Flavio Luiz; Toaldo, Ana Maria] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Business Adm, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana,"von der Osten, FL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Business Adm, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",flavioosten@gmail.com,,"Osten, Flavio/0000-0001-7250-9066",CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior) [001],CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),The study was funded by CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior) under award number 001.,,84,1,1,8,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0263-4503,1758-8049,,MARK INTELL PLAN,Mark.

Individual incentives are not aligned with group gains in cooperatives because individual members bear the costs of offering higher qualities, whereas the benefits from these higher qualities are shared among all members. We present a blind mechanism whose quality-enhancing properties are analyzed in a theoretical model. This mechanism, which does not require individual monitoring, consists of individually punishing co-op members by using aggregate co-op performance in such way that the better the co-op quality, the lower the exclusion probability. In a computerized environment, using experimental methods, we specifically test the effectiveness of our mechanism in alleviating the incentive problem. Experimental results show that our blind punishment mechanism achieves significant efficiency gains.","[Fatas, Enrique] Univ Valencia, LINEEX, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Fatas, Enrique] Univ Texas Dallas, CBEES, Dallas, TX 75230 USA; [Jimenez-Jimenez, Francisca] Univ Jaen, Jaen, Spain; [Morales, Antonio J.] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Universidad de Jaen; Universidad de Malaga,"Fatas, E (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, LINEEX, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",Enrique.Fatas@uv.es,"Jiménez, Francisca Jiménez/P-7720-2015; JIMENEZ-JIMENEZ, FRANCISCA/ABD-7227-2020; Fatas, Enrique/ITV-7431-2023; Morales, Antonio J/A-4426-2013","Jiménez, Francisca Jiménez/0000-0002-4129-0556; JIMENEZ-JIMENEZ, FRANCISCA/0000-0002-4129-0556; Morales, Antonio J/0000-0002-2843-8245; Fatas, Enrique/0000-0002-0603-2156",,,,,35,7,7,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

But there have also been significant changes. While, in the agricultural sector, much of the literature on agricultural co-operatives has highlighted their continued market dominance, this article focuses on the case of an unsuccessfully transformed tobacco co-operative in the small South African town of Mokopane. While state deregulation of the agricultural sector did not mean that all forms of associational support for farmers were lost, farmers there faced a more precarious position. A general decline in farming has resulted in significant changes in the nature of land utilisation. Mining and game farming have become the district's economic mainstay. This article also highlights shifts away from communal, inter-personal forms of organisation within co-operatives well before the official coming of the neo-liberal epoch. None the less, the scope of decision-making by co-operative management was limited by the oversight of the Ministry of Agriculture, which functioned as a safety net of sorts, but also considered that the interests of ordinary farmers were best upheld by co-operatives remaining non-profit entities.","[Ballim, Faeeza] Univ Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Ballim, F (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa.",faeeza.ballim@gmail.com,,,"NRF Chair 'Local Histories, Present Realities' programme based at the University of the Witwatersrand","NRF Chair 'Local Histories, Present Realities' programme based at the University of the Witwatersrand","Research for this article was conducted with the generous funding of the NRF Chair 'Local Histories, Present Realities' programme based at the University of the Witwatersrand, under the helpful supervision and support of Professor Philip Bonner.

It has been argued that the cooperative movement developed in areas where small and middle-sized farms were relatively important. This paper seeks to complement this explanation by analysing the role played by the pre-existing stock of social capital. The prior importance of institutions built around the use and management of collective resources is explored as an alternative proxy for social capital in pre-industrial economies. The results show that the social networks built around common lands and irrigation communities were a key element, together with relatively high levels of human capital and the existence of a wide layer of middle size farms, in facilitating the emergence of the cooperative movement in rural areas.","Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford,"Tapia, FJB (corresponding author), Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",francisco.beltran@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Tapia, Francisco J Beltrán/H-4337-2015","Tapia, Francisco J Beltrán/0000-0002-7354-5699; Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,88,39,40,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

This paper adopts the social innovation approach to examine Alternative Food Networks. The main aim of the study is to identify key factors in the emergence and development of social innovation processes that give rise to new organisational formulas among farmers, which contribute to the coordination and efficiency of food supply in Alternative Food Networks. The article provides an original conceptual framework on territorial social innovation (TerriSI), which is empirically tested in a case study in Ibiza (Spain). Through a mixed methods approach, the study analyses the emergence and development of a new agricultural cooperative that involves producers participating in Alternative Food Networks in Ibiza. This is considered a socially innovative initiative since it comprises novel social reconfigurations within the local context. The findings underline key factors of territorial social innovation linked to the particular conditions of territories, triggers, leadership, coordination mechanisms, and the capacity to disseminate innovation through the territory.","[Vercher, Nestor] Univ Valencia, Res Inst Local Dev, Valencia 46010, Spain",University of Valencia,"Vercher, N (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Res Inst Local Dev, Valencia 46010, Spain.",nestor.vercher@uv.es,,"Vercher, Nestor/0000-0001-9950-4089",Spanish Ministry of Universities [FPU 15/03280]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2016-077623]; European Social Fund; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [CSO2015-68215-R],Spanish Ministry of Universities(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Universities (FPU 15/03280) and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (BES-2016-077623), co-funded by the European Social Fund.

Agricultural cooperatives have played an important role in promoting the modernization and intensification of Chinese agricultural sector. Given the increasing concerns about environmental harm, however, it still remains unclear whether and the extent to which agricultural cooperatives contributes to reducing environmental impacts of agricultural production. Hence, this study performed an environmental evaluation using life cycle assessment for three different organization forms of grape production in Changli County, Hebei Province, China: smallholder farmers, farmer-owned cooperatives and investor-owned firm-led cooperatives. Then the results of life cycle assessment were monetarized and cost benefit analysis was used to evaluate the economic performance of these three organization forms of grape production. The results demonstrate that investor-owned firm-led cooperatives present an overall improvement in environmental and economic performance with the lowest weighted environmental index (integrating all impact categories into a single score), the highest net profit and the highest total net benefit. The results also show a difference in potential improvement in environmental impacts and economic returns between cooperatives and smallholder farmers. Additionally, the production and application of organic and chemical fertilizer and pesticide have been identified as major contributors to total environmental damage.","[Deng, Lei; Chen, Lei] Beijing Wuzi Univ, Sch Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jingjie] State Taxat Adm, Beijing Municipal Tax Serv, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jingjie] Chinese Acad Fiscal Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ruimei] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Wuzi University; China Agricultural University,"Deng, L (corresponding author), Beijing Wuzi Univ, Sch Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",dengleibwu@126.com,,"Lei, Deng/0000-0001-8695-534X",Beijing Social Science Foundation [19GLC043]; Beijing Intelligent Logistics System Collaborative Innovation Center [BILSCIC-2018KF-05]; Beijing Key Laboratory [BZ0211]; Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences [16AJY013]; Beijing Wuzi University [03519012010309],Beijing Social Science Foundation; Beijing Intelligent Logistics System Collaborative Innovation Center; Beijing Key Laboratory; Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences; Beijing Wuzi University,"This work was supported by Beijing Social Science Foundation (No. 19GLC043); the Beijing Intelligent Logistics System Collaborative Innovation Center (No. BILSCIC-2018KF-05); the Beijing Key Laboratory (No. BZ0211); the Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences (No. 16AJY013); Beijing Wuzi University (No. 03519012010309).

Mandatory Cooperatives is a special category of cooperatives that is characterized by a higher degree of reciprocal behaviour among members than traditional cooperatives. This paper examines the differences in financial level of these two categories (mandatory cooperatives versus traditional agricultural cooperatives) with the help of a financial approach, which is based on panel data analysis techniques. Several notions and concepts forming the financial engineering methodological framework are adopted for the design of this approach.

This study aims at presenting a model about how social capital within the cooperatives can be converted into financial capital to the benefit of both the cooperative and the members. Case studies of four cooperatives serve as illustrations. There is a large amount of social capital in these cooperatives, with their operations simple enough to allow members to be involved. The supplying members (common members) are few and well acquainted with one another. They have close relationships with those individuals (core members) who have the dominating ownership and who run the cooperatives. These case cooperatives were chosen because they have innovative financial solutions. For example, members let their private assets and those of the cooperative constitute joint collateral when money is borrowed from financial institutions. In another case, the members trust each other sufficiently for there to be a mutual fund that lends money both to members and their cooperative. Yet another model involves members having low demands concerning capital returns when lending to their cooperative.","[Yu, Liyan] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Nilsson, Jerker] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Nilsson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",yuliyan733@163.com; Jerker.Nilsson@slu.se,,"Yu, Liyan/0000-0002-1903-3721",China Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar [xjq201632]; Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Research Fund for Young Teachers [2013xjj27],China Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Research Fund for Young Teachers,China Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (Grant no. xjq201632) and Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Research Fund for Young Teachers (Grant no. 2013xjj27) provided funding for this project.,,44,8,9,7,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 2,2019,11,8,,,,,,,2415,10.3390/su11082415,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11082415,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HX9TU,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000467752200228,View Full Record in Web of Science

With a cohort of 421 farmer members in the Kampong Speu and Pursat provinces of Cambodia, household surveys were designed to consider how factors influence local engagement. It was discovered that: (i) local engagement in ACs operations is limited, and management of boards of directors is a critical constraint to motivating local involvement; (ii) local engagement in ACs operations is associated with access to water, benefits from ACs, participation in ACs activities, risk control and ACs management, and ACs operations do not promote access to agricultural inputs; and (iii) ACs operations have faced several constraints, including poor management, inadequate capital accumulation, unavailable loans, loan mismanagement, a lack of skills, high illiteracy levels, small share values, a lack of access to credit facilities, access to the competitive market and a lack of support from extension services.

This paper offers a solidary critique of ACs beyond the dominant institutional economics lens, and aims to resume the debate on their de/repoliticisation. Evidence presented points towards a continuous process of co-optation of ACs by the dominant food regime as well as decreased adherence to cooperative principles, revealing theoretical parallelisms with the organic and fair trade movements. While acknowledging the important role ACs play in supporting farmers, many of who interviewed for this research reported they could not survive without them, this paper warns of the loss of their historical political roots, and introduces a new theoretical framework for a more integrated study of ACs in the context of wider food system forces. The framework is composed of three conceptual components: first, the coooperative triangle illustrates interwoven cooperative identitary dimensions; second, the cooperative hourglass depicts ongoing tensions between the cooperative economic and governance model, and the market economy they exist in; and third, the concept of cooperative sustainability brings together the previous two components to analyse ACs' ability and capacity to maintain the dimensions indicated in the cooperative triangle while also fostering environmental sustainability through their practices.","[Ajates, Raquel] Univ Dundee, Duncan Jordanstone Sch Art & Design, Dundee, Scotland",University of Dundee,"Ajates, R (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Duncan Jordanstone Sch Art & Design, Dundee, Scotland.",r.ajatesgonzalez@dundee.ac.uk,"Ajates, Raquel/AAU-7522-2020","Ajates, Raquel/0000-0003-2127-8784","Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London","Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London","This research was funded by the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London.",,113,33,33,8,44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

To inform possible solutions, a better understanding of the complex interrelationships of member attitudes and perceptions is necessary. Using survey responses from 1,116 members of an organic marketing cooperative in the United States, this paper develops a structural equation model of six factors: organic lifestyle, mission support, participation, trust, satisfaction, and long-term commitment. The final model illustrates nine significant relationships, including satisfaction and long-term commitment. The result suggests the long-term survival or viability of farmer cooperatives is not only dependent on its financial performance but also the utility of its members. In terms of member attitudes and perceptions, trust and mission support may offer the best opportunities for farmer cooperatives to foster member satisfaction and thus address the negative consequences of heterogeneity.","[Grashuis, Jasper; Cook, Michael Lee] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Grashuis, J (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grashuisj@missouri.edu,,"Grashuis, Jasper/0000-0002-5075-4439",,,,,53,15,17,4,21,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Data collection was conducted by questionnaire containing 81 questions divided into three blocks. As for the approach to the research problem, the study is mainly quantitative. Corporate governance mechanisms (MGC) were determined from the guidelines issued by the Brazilian Institute of Corporate Governance (IBGC) and included: the participation of cooperative members, the board of directors, the executive board, the audit and fiscal council. The CVO were determined from Miller and Friesen's (1984) theory: birth, growth, maturity, rejuvenation and decline. For the data analysis procedure, we used descriptive analysis, application of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and multinomial logistic regression.

Using large sample data from Jilin Province, this paper examines the decision-making mechanism of farmers in joining cooperatives and analyzes farmers' awareness of cooperatives and relative laws, willingness to participate, real behaviors and performance in cooperatives. Empirical results show that farmers' education level, the variety of agricultural products, planting area, future planting plan, sales difficulties, low prices of agricultural products, labor shortage, agricultural production costs and risks are the most influential factors in deciding what behaviors to take, while planting area, agricultural production costs, the variety of agricultural products and lack of agricultural insurance are the most influential factors deciding the final performance achieved.

In the meantime, the rapid development of the animal husbandry in Iran has forced cooperatives to meet the members' scientific and practical needs for completing production cycle of the dairy industry. Livestock production covers a wide spectrum of livestock activities including bee keeping, silkworm raising, and aquaculture, indicating widespread business systems in Iranian animal husbandry. Due to significant livestock population, various animal products, such as raw milk, red meat, white meat ( chicken and fish), eggs, and honey are produced. Thus, the mentioned cooperatives need to meet the markets demands for keeping competitive advantage more than any time before. Only when innovation is fostered, market competitive advantage can be maintained. Today, sustainability and innovation issues have a great importance in some organizations such as agriculture cooperatives. The term entrepreneurship is coined to describe this need to keep organizations in competitive situation by innovations tools. Presently, it is believed that entrepreneurship can be developed. Organizational, personal, and environmental aspects are important factors toward entrepreneurship fostering. This study took into consideration three factors in cooperatives, including structure, strategy, and leadership. The results of research revealed that these three variables play important role in entrepreneurship development in cooperatives. Thus, consideration of these aspects can help in development and boost cooperatives profits. The result of modeling by structural equations methods showed that 38% of the variance of entrepreneurship as a dependent variable could be explained by these three factors in cooperatives.","[Pishbin, S.

The objective of this research is to address an emerging problem seen in the business model of agricultural cooperatives. These vertically expanded farmer associations market their products jointly. However, within the cooperatives farmers remain competitors seeking their own best interest, simultaneously seeking contracts for the most profitable crops in the most desirable part of the season; this behavior can work to the detriment of the group. The model developed considers the problem of asymmetric information and internal competition within the cooperative, as well as traditional factors relevant to agricultural planning. Thereafter, an auction based coordination mechanism is formulated, which leads production decisions toward a coordinated outcome despite each individual acting independently and on his/her best interest. The mechanism is shown to approximate optimal production targets through focused information discovery and a well-structured contract allocation methodology. The results presented show the viability of implementing such planning scheme in practice as well as the optimality gap under a variety of settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Faced with the logic of structural adjustment, austerity and cuts in social services, interesting critical socio-educational experiences have arisen, such as the Hortigas Agroecological Cooperative (based in Andalusia, Spain).This is presented as an 'alternative' practice based on food sovereignty and responsible consumption, promoting principles such as horizontality, mutual support, collaboration, autonomy and dialogical learning. On a methodological level, we apply an intrinsic case study using semi-structured depth interviews, documentary analysis and ethnographic observation. We analyse a self-managed practice that embraces assembly, community and solidarity values. This is in sharp contrast to the individualism, insecurity and uncertainty that characterise precarisation processes.

In this context, this paper investigates the exchange rate exposure faced by a unique data set of 66 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives from 2000 to 2015, and finds that around one-third of the sampled firms exhibited significant exposure during this period, even after controlling for crises. The paper also documents that the proportion of exposed firms doubles during periods in which the local central bank intervenes more in the currency regime, lending support to the moral hazard hypothesis: when the exchange rate is less flexible, local companies tend to adopt unhedged positions in response to implicit government guarantees. Finally, firms with more debt, better asset management, lower inventory levels, and higher product differentiation tend to be less exposed to currency swings [EconLit Citations: F31, G15, G23].","[Piccoli, Pedro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Grad Program Cooperat Management, Rua Imaculada Conceicao 1155, BR-80215901 Curitiba, PR, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana,"Piccoli, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Grad Program Cooperat Management, Rua Imaculada Conceicao 1155, BR-80215901 Curitiba, PR, Brazil.",pedro.guilherme@pucpr.br,,,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [424782/2018-9]; CNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [424782/2018-9],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 424782/2018-9; CNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 424782/2018-9",,28,1,1,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,JAN,2020,36,1,,,,,94,110,,10.1002/agr.21629,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.21629,,NOV 2019,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,KB5GG,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000495796900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper concludes that benchmarking is strategically feasible, that it has a favourable impact on the perceptions and attitudes of staff and members of participating cooperatives, and that-it yields workable priorities and management recommendations, which-can be implemented. Wider-adoption of the technique by cooperatives is therefore recommended as a viable survival strategy-an alternative to the recent preference for abandonment of cooperative status.

The cattle sector was one of the most affected by agricultural land fragmentation in post-communist Romania. Establishing agricultural cooperatives in Romania is still seen with reluctance due to the forced collectivization process in the '50s. The Polish communist regime didn't abolish private farm ownership and agricultural cooperatives have a long tradition. Polish cooperatives undertake more joint activities, such as processing and financing investment for members, while Romanian ones limit themselves to raw milk production. Some of the problems Romanian and Polish organizations are facing are common. Additionally, Polish cooperatives are also facing problems related to their milk processing activities. Romanian cooperatives must think of vertical integration and include processing in their activities, as a necessary step for development and for gaining more negotiating power in the milk chain.","[Sin, Alexandru] Romanian Acad, Natl Inst Econ Res Costin C Kiritescu, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania; [Nowak, Czeslaw] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-3120 Krakow, Poland",National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

As a result, several arrangements to foster market linkages are being implemented. Especially popular are farmers' organizations, which are believed to be owned, controlled, and financed by smallholders. As such, their design is considered inclusive given every household in a community is theoretically allowed to become a member, and the governance and management structure encourage participatory decision-making. However, even in the context in which farmers' organizations are actively promoted, a notable proportion of smallholders may not be able to engage in market-oriented production or may opt for the existing alternative marketing arrangements, as dictated by individual households' socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on the case of smallholder farming in Olenguruone, Nakuru county, Kenya, where a donor funded dairy farmers' cooperative marketing arrangement is promoted alongside existing marketing opportunities, the present research investigated the factors that determine smallholders' commercial farming orientation and marketing arrangements. It employed a case study approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods for a more complete empirical inquiry. The findings demonstrate that irrespective of the external support provided through marketing opportunities such as farmer organizations, smallholders' engagement in commercial farming and marketing is dictated by the socioeconomic attributes and market perceptions that are heterogeneous among households in a smallholder community.","[Wangu, James; van Westen, A.

Its aim is to provide new insights into the role and importance of cooperatives among poor rural populations. We analyse cooperatives' inclusiveness of smaller herders and farmers and cooperatives' governance structures. The research is based on data collected in selected provinces of the central Tov region. The data were collected for three distinctive target groups - cooperative board members, cooperative members and non-members. We found that the cooperative sector in Mongolia is strongly affected by the governmental policy regarding wool subsidies, which provides subsidies only to cooperative members and has consequently caused rapid growth in the number of new, free-riding cooperative members and led to very low levels of members' self-identification with their cooperatives. This policy also affects the inner organizational structures of cooperatives. Further, we found indications that poorer farmers tend not to be members of cooperatives and that the overall benefits for non-members and the general community arising from local cooperatives are rather low.","[Hilliova, Marketa; Hejkrlik, Jiri; Mazancova, Jana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Tseren, Tserendavaa] Mongolian Univ Life Sci, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Mongolian University of Life Sciences,"Hejkrlik, J (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",hejkrlik@ftz.czu.cz,"Tseren, Tserendavaa/AAB-3892-2021; Mazancová, Jana/AAK-2685-2020; Hejkrlik, Jiri/L-9689-2013","Tseren, Tserendavaa/0000-0001-5328-2521; Hejkrlik, Jiri/0000-0002-1337-5261; Mazancova, Jana/0000-0002-7735-5606",,,,,39,2,2,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

This paper analyses how the interaction between formal and informal mechanisms minimizes coordination and motivation problems. Based on a multiple case study approach, the paper shows that the use of informal mechanisms results from the failure of formal mechanisms to minimize opportunism among members.

This study analyzes the impact of commercial vegetable cooperative membership on smallholder agricultural performance in Cambodia. Institutional heterogeneities are considered across cooperatives and various econometric techniques are used to control for potential selection bias. The impacts of horticulture on agricultural outcomes are also analyzed. The results indicate that membership of commercial vegetable cooperatives has so far had no effect on agricultural incomes or the value or amounts of agricultural inputs. However, results indicate that membership has affected technology choice, access to credit services and information transmission through technological training. Additionally, there is evidence that horticulture, as a component of overall agricultural diversification, can augment farm income. The results suggest that much of the benefit of cooperative membership stems from the cooperative's provision of services, which might not be easily inferred from measures of member incomes.","[Ofori, Eric; Sampson, Gabriel S.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Vipham, Jessie] Kansas State Univ, Dept Anim Sci & Ind, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University; Kansas State University,"Ofori, E (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ekofori@ksu.edu; gsampson@ksu.edu; jessiev@ksu.edu,,,,,,,47,19,20,9,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and biological risks are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision-makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease.","[de la Cruz, Jaye] Wageningen Univ & Res, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jansen, Kees] Wageningen Univ & Res, Rural Sociol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"de la Cruz, J (corresponding author), 4-F Leeuwenborch Bldg,Hollandseweg 1 Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",jaye.delacruz@wur.nl,"Jansen, Kees/C-3222-2008","Jansen, Kees/0000-0003-4050-7407",,,,,58,17,17,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

However, by improving access to markets and technologies, household membership in POs often results in commercialization of smallholder farming, leading to women disempowerment as men take over control of the farm. We use data from dairy smallholders in Kenya to explore the impact of membership in bargaining and processing POs on women empowerment. Applying the Women Empowerment Livestock Index, we capture six domains of empowerment: production; nutrition; resources; income; opportunities; and workload. We find that when a household joins any PO, regardless of whether the man or the woman in the household is the registered member, women achieve a higher control over production decisions, buying and selling of land and cows, use of loans and receiving dairy income. Distinguishing by gender of membership, there is stronger women empowerment when the woman in the household is a member. We also find that woman membership in bargaining POs results in greater empowerment, in terms of ownership of cows, than woman membership in processing POs.

There exists, however, the problem of high heterogeneity within cooperatives regarding members' commitment, with many passive members holding only formal membership and having a minimal understanding of the cooperative's principles and benefits. The main objective of this study was to analyse how varying levels of members' commitment determine their economic benefits. We selected a total of 215 rice farmers (72 active and 143 passive members) from two rice-dominant districts and used the propensity score matching technique and endogenous treatment regression model for the analysis. The study results show that educational level, distance to the cooperative, members' perception about trust and acceptance, and value of the investment in the cooperative have a considerable influence on member commitment. The results further indicate that actively committed members of the cooperative achieve much more economic benefits than passive members.","[Donkor, Ebenezer; Hejkrlik, Jiri] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hejkrlik, J (corresponding author), Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",hejkrlik@ftz.czu.cz,"Hejkrlik, Jiri/L-9689-2013","Hejkrlik, Jiri/0000-0002-1337-5261; Donkor, Ebenezer/0000-0001-8621-9705","Grant Agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CIGA) [20185001]; Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences [20205008]; Caritas Czech Republic, Mongu","Grant Agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CIGA)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences; Caritas Czech Republic, Mongu","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Grant Agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CIGA) (Grant No. 20185001) and the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences (Grant No. 20205008).

Despite this fact, in Iran and many other developing countries, they have not had remarkable successes in this regard. Because strategy formulation and management is a plan to obtain far-reaching development effects of any organization. This study aimed to present a hybrid method to formulate and choose strategies for rural cooperatives development. It combined SWOT analysis, TOWS matrix, and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). We applied brainstorming technique to analyze the external and internal environment of rural cooperatives using the contributions of an experts' team comprising 10 individual CEOs of rural cooperatives and senior employees of the Central Organization of Rural Cooperatives. When this team identified key SWOT factors, TOWS matrix was constructed to create good strategic alternatives. Finally, ANP was applied to prioritize the strategies. According to results, 19 key strategic factors such as lack of management knowledge (W4), and ability to improve value and supply chains (S4) were identified. In addition, this team identified 11 strategic alternatives which among them Implement public policy and provide technical and financial services (SO2), Facilitate procurement of inputs and develop supply and value chains (SO1) and Involve rural cooperatives in policy planning (ST1), had greater priority in Iran. The experts' team believed that the presented combined approach helps decision makers and managers to make and choose the best alternative strategies and factors that affect rural cooperatives development.","[Barati, A.

This proposition is investigated empirically using data from member surveys in three Swedish farm supply and grain marketing cooperatives that vary greatly in size, from about 36,000 to 1,600 and 150 members.

In South Africa, renewed interest in development-oriented cooperatives saw the introduction of a new Cooperatives Act in 2005, along with support measures dedicated to 'emerging' cooperatives. This paper contends that the architects of the new Act discounted important trends in international legislation that would have made development-oriented cooperatives more versatile and given their members better access to capital and expertise through equity partnerships with private agribusiness firms. It is concluded that the new Act should be amended to admit non-patron investors as members, and to allow for non-redeemable and hence appreciable and tradable shares. Such innovations are emerging internationally, usually with a cap on non-patron voting power.","[Lyne, M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Sci & Agribusiness, Durban, South Africa; [Lyne, M.] Lincoln Univ, Agr Grp, Agr & Life Sci Div, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand; [Collins, R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Nat & Rural Syst Management, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia",University of Kwazulu Natal; Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Queensland,"Lyne, M (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Sci & Agribusiness, Durban, South Africa.",lynem@lincoln.ac.nz; rcollins@uqg.uq.edu.au,"Lyne, Michael C/V-8732-2018; Collins, Ray/B-3531-2010","Lyne, Michael C/0000-0002-4530-1195;",National Research Foundation (NRF) [GUN 2054254],National Research Foundation (NRF),"The first author gratefully acknowledges funding from the National Research Foundation (NRF), under grant number GUN 2054254, in South Africa.

The province of Almeria, Spain, is an example of smallholding rapid development due to the expansion of intensive greenhouse horticulture. It was the poorest Spanish province per capita in 1955, semi-arid, drought-ridden, and devoid of significant infrastructure. Its undereducated population held little promise for economic growth and a massive migration out of the province left it depopulated. Subsequent economic and social development of Almeria was closely tied to the establishment of both credit and agricultural cooperatives, which supported a new greenhouse agriculture for small plot family farmers organized around cooperatives. This paper focuses on how cooperatives were fundamental in constructing civil society for the benefit of poor rural people, even in the presence of significant negative social capital and undemocratic institutions during the Franco dictatorship. As the sector has modernized and matured, cooperatives have led the sustainable transformation of the business ecosystem. However, current shortcomings in the Almeria cooperative movement and civil society and challenges yet to be met are also raised.","[Giagnocavo, Cynthia] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Giagnocavo, Cynthia] Univ Almeria, Chair Catedra Coexphal UAL Agr Cooperat Studies &, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Giagnocavo, Cynthia] Univ Almeria, Ctr Res Mediterranean Intens Agrosyst & Agrifood, Almeria 04120, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Giagnocavo, C (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.;Giagnocavo, C (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Chair Catedra Coexphal UAL Agr Cooperat Studies &, Almeria 04120, Spain.;Giagnocavo, C (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Ctr Res Mediterranean Intens Agrosyst & Agrifood, Almeria 04120, Spain.",cgiagnocavo@ual.es,"Giagnocavo, Cynthia/AAA-8983-2019","Giagnocavo, Cynthia/0000-0001-9349-9581",European Union through the H2020 research and innovation programme project IoF2020 [731884]; European Union through the H2020 research and innovation programme project SmartAgriHubs [818182]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [818182] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union through the H2020 research and innovation programme project IoF2020; European Union through the H2020 research and innovation programme project SmartAgriHubs; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020),This research was partially funded by the European Union through the H2020 research and innovation programme projects IoF2020 (grant number 731884) and SmartAgriHubs (grant number 818182).,,78,2,2,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,12,23,,,,,,,9820,10.3390/su12239820,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12239820,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PD2CF,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000597498800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since rice is a major staple food in China, understanding factors affecting the performance of rice total factor productivity (TFP) is of great importance for China's future food security. Despite the growing importance of agricultural TFP, rigorous evidence-based studies on the impacts of cooperative membership on agricultural TFP, especially rice TFP, are scant, hindering the understanding about the potential contribution of agricultural cooperatives to TFP growth. This study examines the impacts of cooperative membership on rice productivity in China by using country-representative survey data from 2014 to 2018. An endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias. The empirical results show that cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact not only on rice TFP but also on TFP change, technical change and technical efficiency change. The results are robust to alternative choice of instrument variables. The effects of cooperatives on rice productivity are highly heterogeneous with regard to regions, farm scales and mechanization levels. Rice TFP gains through cooperatives are larger for producers in the eastern and central regions, while the effect on TFP growth is the highest in the western region. Regarding farm scales, cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact on rice TFP for small and medium farms but not for large farms. Moreover, cooperatives help improve rice productivity for provinces with low mechanization level of producers. This study further explores the underlying channels through which cooperative membership impacts rice productivity, and identifies that mechanical cultivation, high-quality inputs and technical training appear to be the main channels.

This means that they generally operate in accordance with the principles endorsed by the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA). However, only a few of these organizations are successful in commercializing the agricultural produce of their members. In this study, we argue that growth-problems leading to commercial failure and organizational degeneration in these cooperatives can be attributed to a lack of managerial capital. Drawing on the literature and evidence from the field we set out key management solutions for counterbalancing cooperative principles in the context of rural Africa. These solutions were taught to the leaders and managers of 362 cooperatives at four training events held in Madagascar, Malawi and twice in Uganda. Using a production function for cognitive achievement and key informant interviews, we find that our training contributed to the adoption of the proposed solutions by some of the cooperatives. Using the Ugandan sub- sample, we estimate an OLS regression and a PSM model to show that the training translated into higher revenues per member generated through collective commercialization.","[Francesconi, Gian Nicola] Agr & Rural Cooperat EU & ACP Countries CTA, Tech Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wouterse, Fleur] Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Int Food Policy Res Inst, The Hague, Netherlands",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Francesconi, GN (corresponding author), Agr & Rural Cooperat EU & ACP Countries CTA, Tech Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands.",francesconi@edc.coop; f.wouterse@cgiar.org,,,CTA; OCDC; Oxfam; CIAT; EU; USAID; Ford Foundation; CGIAR; NCBA-CLUSA; GIZ; FAO; USADF; ACDI-VOCA; IFAD; UCA; UNFFE; NASFAM; FUM; MUSCCO; ACE ltd.; Government of Uganda; Government of Malawi; Government of Madagascar,CTA; OCDC; Oxfam; CIAT; EU(European Union (EU)); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Ford Foundation; CGIAR(CGIAR); NCBA-CLUSA; GIZ; FAO; USADF; ACDI-VOCA; IFAD; UCA; UNFFE; NASFAM; FUM; MUSCCO; ACE ltd.; Government of Uganda; Government of Malawi; Government of Madagascar,"The EDC program and this study were financed by CTA, OCDC, Oxfam and CIAT, with funding from the EU, USAID, the Ford Foundation and the CGIAR.

An ordered multi classification logistic regression model was utilized to empirically analyze the association between the variables. The results showed that social networks have a significant positive impact on the households' participation in cooperatives/communities. Among other variables, network interaction, network learning, network trust, and households' participation in green energy technologies and cooperatives/community showed significant and positive correlation, but the variable network reciprocity was found to be negatively correlated to the adoption of green energy technologies. Study findings further revealed that, there is an interaction effect in the participation of households' behavioral decision-making and joining cooperatives. Furthermore, the social experience of the head of the household and the source of income of the family showed a significant positive association with households' participation in cooperatives/communities.

To fill the evidence gap on whether the two goals collide or coincide, we drawn on microdata including over 7,000 Brazilian cooperatives. Stochastic frontier models were used to estimate the relative level of efficiency and to relate it with cooperativism level measured as participatory decision-making and integration to cooperatives' networks. Results showed that the former dimension of cooperativism presented a positive effect that dominated the negative effect of network integration. So that efficiency (weakly) increased with an index aggregating the two cooperativism's dimensions. This was coherent with case studies attesting Brazilian cooperatives capacity to overcome threats to efficiency with organizational changes including the introduction of probation, dismissing and hiring of non-member workers, thus preserving core principles. Results were also consistent with theoretical studies which both argue that shirking and high transaction costs are the main threats to efficiency facing cooperatives and also that these are mitigatable by common principles fostering consensus and a participatory environment minimizing conflicts and disclosing private information.

The farmer is required to purchase a certain amount of shares within specific limits to join in the co-op. The equity investment entitles the right to deliver a particular amount of qualified raw commodity in proportion, and the shares are transferable and appreciable. We consider a multi-period model in which the farmer first considers a one-time decision on participation (whether to join in the co-op). If yes, the farmer determines the production capacity and the initial equity investment in addition to the periodic production planning and equity investment adjustment when yield, spot prices, and share price are uncertain. We propose the condition under which the farmer shall participate in the co-op and characterize the optimal capacity and equity investment policies in closed form. We also investigate how the transferability of shares affects the farmer's optimal decisions and profitability by fixing the initial equity investment. Further, we examine the performance of a variety of heuristic policies when the quality requirement or the yield uncertainty is ignored. The results provide insights into a farmer's decision making, production planning, and cash management. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of the relationship between these companies, agrarian cooperatives, and the oil economy calls into question assessments by both the right and the left, the former portraying Venezuelan development initiatives as populist profligacy and the latter seeing them as a socialist alternative to neoliberal hegemony. An analytical focus upon ground rent and the way it is distributed through the social production companies that draws upon insights from the Marxian critique of political economy provides an original window onto the contradictions and limits of the Chavez government's development policies. Three case studies suggest that social production companies and their links with small agrarian cooperatives are reproducing a limited and ground-rent-dependent form of capital accumulation that, coupled with the ideology of popular power, is being presented as a step toward twenty-first-century socialism.","Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"Purcell, TF (corresponding author), Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Purcell, Thomas Francis/I-3685-2019","Purcell, Thomas Francis/0000-0003-1825-0916",,,,,61,16,17,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0094-582X,1552-678X,,LAT AM PERSPECT,Lat.

Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and market poultry, one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa's new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equity-sharing partnerships.","[Chibanda, M.; Ortmann, G.

The statistical results display that specific dimensions of social capital may not deliver the benefits expected by cooperative practitioners and academics. Both positive and negative effects of social capital on performances of farmer cooperatives are observed. To be specific, bonding social capital is positively associated with common members' economic benefits. Bridging social capital generates beneficial outcomes for the financial and social performances of cooperatives, while exhibiting negative influence on common members' income increase because of member heterogeneity.","[Xu, Yining; Liang, Qiao; Huang, Zuhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Liang, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",liangqiao2323@126.com,,"Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573227, 71333011]; Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [17NDJC93YB]; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [14CJY042]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71573227, Grant No. 71333011), the Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 17NDJC93YB), and National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 14CJY042).",,63,19,19,5,41,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

A series of indicators related to cooperatives in Germany were analyzed and presented. Forms of associations, producer groups and horizontal and vertical cooperation have proven to be opportunities for small business development. This is underlined by agricultural cooperatives in Germany, a major EU grower, farmer and producer, at the forefront of agricultural excellence. Agricultural cooperatives are associations of farmers and family farms working together on the land. They are established by law to increase efficiency and strengthen market positions. At the same time, they take responsibility for all aspects of the environment, thereby preserving the landscape and preserving the biodiversity of plant and animal species. On the one hand, many cooperatives use the latest technologies in fields such as farming, fertilization, plant protection, and the introduction of digitalization in the production process promotes the development of environmentally friendly management. After German reunification, existing economic units were dissolved or converted. Those who continued their activities took the legal form of agricultural producers' cooperatives, sponsored and represented by the Cooperative Audit Association and the German Association of Raiffeisen. Statistical data used in this research was mainly taken from the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) website, the rest being obtained from other sources.","[Chiurciu, Irina-Adriana; Vlad, Ionela Mituko; Soare, Elena; TOMA (Diaconu), Elena; Firatoiu, Andreea-Roxana] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest Bucharest, Fac Management & Rural Dev, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania",,"Chiurciu, IA (corresponding author), Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest Bucharest, Fac Management & Rural Dev, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania.",chiurciu.irina@managusamv.ro; vlad.ionela@managusamv.ro; soare.elena@managusamv.ro; toma.elena@managusamv.ro; andreea.chiurciu@gmail.com,"TOMA, ELENA/B-1263-2012; Adriana, CHIURCIU Irina/D-3119-2016","TOMA, ELENA/0000-0002-5716-9486; Adriana, CHIURCIU Irina/0000-0002-9677-6836",Project ERASMUS [2019-1RO01-KA203-063752],Project ERASMUS,"This research work was carried out with the support of the Project ERASMUS+2019-1RO01-KA203-063752 Coo Performance Digital, state-of-the-art agribusiness education for farmer led enterprises in the agri-food value chain.",,16,1,1,3,3,UNIV AGRONOMIC SCIENCES & VETERINARY MEDICINE BUCHAREST - USAMV,BUCHAREST,"59 MARASTI BOULEVARD, DISTRICT 1, BUCHAREST, 011464, ROMANIA",2284-7995,2285-3952,,SCI PAP-SER MANAG EC,Sci.

However, the operating team of the cooperatives may have different interests. Under this situation, the terms of contract between farmers and cooperatives are important to both sides. Farmers' share of the cooperatives' profits specified in the contracts is an important issue in the long- term sustainability of rice processing and marketing in Korea. This paper discusses the behavior of farmers and their cooperatives in determining the optimal share of profits in their contracts. It also illustrates the impacts of the policy changes due to the Korea's accession to the WTO on the relative negotiation power between farmers and cooperatives. The results show that the Korean rice cooperatives have more negotiation power than farmers. They set the profit share to farmers based on their own profit maximization criteria, while taking farmers supply decision into consideration. Farmers only choose how much to supply. This relationship was seen changing after 2005, when the Korean government reduced and removed the price subsidy it provided to rice cooperatives before. As the cooperatives' margin goes down without the subsidy, farmers are pushed to bargain hard for their share of the margin to maintain their revenue.","[Wang, H.

We analyse their current role by investigating the characteristics of farmers who continue delivering to them and price differentials between cooperatives and investor-oriented firms (IOFs). A probit regression model applied to 917 farmers suggests that cooperative farmers are more disadvantaged than farmers delivering to IOFs in terms of education, farm size and productive technology. Moreover, t-tests applied to data representing 70 per cent of national volume indicate that farmers delivering to cooperatives are between 11 per cent and 29 per cent smaller than those delivering to IOFs, depending on province. A hierarchical multilevel regression model applied to 9,720 transactions among farmers and processors shows that, after controlling for quantity and quality, cooperatives pay lower (3.5%) but more stable prices than IOFs. In a context of rapid structural change, we observe a market in which larger farmers deliver to IOFs and smaller farmers deliver to cooperatives and conclude that, at the expense of paying lower prices, cooperatives may act as buyers of last resort for otherwise disadvantaged farmers.","[Malvido Perez Carletti, Agustina; Hanisch, Markus] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Soledad Puechagut, Maria; Beatriz Gastaldi, Laura] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Humboldt University of Berlin; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA),"Malvido Perez Carletti, A (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",agustina.malvido@hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Taking 245 members of 18 agricultural cooperatives as samples, this paper makes an empirical test by using the machine learning method. Through the analysis of the data, we find that interactive justice has a significant positive impact on the governance performance. Relational embeddedness also has a significant positive impact on the governance performance. And relational embeddedness plays an intermediary role in the positive impact of interactive justice on governance performance.

We study the economic rationale for cooperative acting as an intermediary between producers and a downstream (DS) firm when the DS firm cannot observe the individual quality of producers but only the average quality. We derive the optimal contract to elicit the quality and quantity incentives for producers, depending on whether the DS firm directly deals with producers or indirectly deals with them through a producer-owned cooperative. We find that when the DS firm directly deals with producers via secret contracts, the opportunistic behavior of the DS firm on producers leads to lower quality and quantity levels. The opportunistic behavior is prevented when the DS firm deals with the producer cooperative. However, the contract should offer a sufficiently high quality payment to overcome the free-riding inefficiency of the producer members.","[Yu, Jianyu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, Res Inst Econ & Management RIEM, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Bonroy, Olivier] Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL, INRAE French Natl Inst Agr Res, Grenoble, France; [Bouamra-Mechemache, Zohra] Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, INRAE, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Yu, JY (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, Res Inst Econ & Management RIEM, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",yujianyu@swufe.edu.cn,,"Bonroy, Olivier/0000-0002-3589-1961",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71711530152]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique [71711530152]; ANR [ANR-17-EURE-0010],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors acknowledge funding received from the joint program of National Natural Science Foundation of China and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (NSFC-CNRS, no. 71711530152) and from ANR under grant ANR-17-EURE-0010 (Investissements d'Avenir program).

The study was carried out in family farming farms in the Sumare Rural Settlement, and in the area of Family Farming and Agroecological Cooperative (Cooperacra), respectively located in the municipalities of Sumare and Americana, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The methodology was based on a case study, using Focal Groups and Field Notes as research instruments. On the basis of our analysis, there were social changes in the farmers' organization and in the decision-making process, as well as in the landscape in the areas of AFS and surroundings, where agroecological principles were also applied to production. In Sumare, the four farmers participating in the project organized themselves to obtain organic certification. Cooperacra, which works with a group of 10 farmers advanced in the process of agroecological transition, starting from an intensive organic horticulture production system to a biodiverse agroforestry system. Despite the short time of the project, the construction of knowledge in relation to agroforestry systems was perceived through management techniques incorporated by the farmers in their agroecosystems. The arboreal component, which thus far the farmers had seen as something to be eliminated to realize agriculture, was introduced and became a relevant part of the process. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of AFS in the process of agroecological transition toward a more sustainable agriculture.","[Bezerra, Leila Pires] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Ctr Agr Sci, Araras, SP, Brazil; [Franco, Fernando Silveira] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Environm Sci, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Souza-Esquerdo, Vanilde F.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Coll Agr Engn, Integrated Council Planning & Management, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Borsatto, Ricardo] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Ctr Nat Sci, Buri, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,"Bezerra, LP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Araras, SP, Brazil.",leilapires02@gmail.com,"Souza-Esquerdo, Vanilde/Z-2064-2018; Borsatto, Ricardo/AAD-4211-2020; Esquerdo, Vanilde/AAT-6159-2020; Franco, Fernando/GYD-9727-2022","Souza-Esquerdo, Vanilde/0000-0002-5015-1216; Borsatto, Ricardo/0000-0002-7594-479X; Esquerdo, Vanilde/0000-0002-5015-1216; Pire Bezerra, Leila/0000-0001-6385-3041; franco, fernando silveira/0000-0002-9093-9956","Conselho Nacional deDesenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico e Ministerio do Desenvolvimento Agrario [Edital MDA/CNPq 039/2014, CNPq 472894/2014-15]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2017/04577-1]",Conselho Nacional deDesenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico e Ministerio do Desenvolvimento Agrario; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"This work was supported by the Conselho Nacional deDesenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico e Ministerio do Desenvolvimento Agrario (Edital MDA/CNPq 039/2014 - Process CNPq 472894/2014-15).

This paper uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and representative data from 4,074 Zambian households to estimate FO impacts on members, with and without controlling for a national input-subsidy program. The results show that Zambian FOs tend to attract better-educated households with larger farm sizes, but can lead to female integration when external subsidies are involved. FOs also have a significantly positive effect on members' farm performance, irrespective of whether members receive input subsidies, while the presence of the external program leads to an unequal distribution of benefits within the FOs: positive impacts on farm performance are, on average 13-44% lower amongst members who do not benefit from the Zambian government program. Overall, these findings imply that Zambian FOs seem to provide benefits that go beyond the intention of the subsidy-program, which can be used to promote women empowerment and smallholder farm performance. The findings also demonstrate, however, that governments need to carefully design their programs to not reinforce inequality amongst farmer organizations and their members.","[Minah, Margitta] Humboldt Univ, Div Econ Agr Cooperat, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Minah, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Div Econ Agr Cooperat, Berlin, Germany.",margitta.minah@agrar.hu-berlin.de,,"Minah, Margitta/0000-0002-4484-2707",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,90,20,20,3,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

A prepared questionnaire was distributed in one of the Russian regions (the Republic of Tatarstan), and the collected data were analyzed via the cross tabulation method and logit analysis. According to the study results, the major reasons for not cooperating are as follows: respondent farmers lack the experience of cooperation, they have problems trusting each other, they are not socially active in their communities, and they rarely have a higher education. The study results recommend that the Ministry of Agriculture, willing to develop agricultural cooperation, pay special attention to educating farmers in terms of cooperation. Particular work should be done in teaching farmers to work in groups, trust each other, and organize systems of cooperative ventures in a way that would exclude cheating and free-riding behavior on the parts of both the cooperative members and the leaders. Stimulating social activities among farmers in rural areas might also increase cooperation. In addition, there is a need for agricultural consulting services offering high quality educational courses explaining the advantages of cooperatives and profits that they may provide to the members.","[Antonova, Maria P.; Ternovsky, Denis S.] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Ctr Agr & Food Policy, 84 Vernadskogo Pr, Moscow 119606, Russia; [Heijman, Wim] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, 129 Kamycka, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Bijman, Jos] Wageningen Univ, 4 Droevendaalsesteeg, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nigmatullina, Liliya A.] Kazan Fed Univ, Engn Inst, 18 Kremlevskaya Ul, Kazan 420008, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Wageningen University & Research; Kazan Federal University,"Antonova, MP (corresponding author), Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Ctr Agr & Food Policy, 84 Vernadskogo Pr, Moscow 119606, Russia.",mj.antonova@gmail.com; wim.heijman@wur.nl; ternovskiy-ds@ranepa.ru; jos.bijman@wur.nl; xatipara@yandex.ru,"Ternovsky, Denis S/N-9930-2016; Antonova, Maria/IQT-9607-2023","Ternovsky, Denis S/0000-0002-0878-962X;",,,,,33,0,0,0,6,EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA,MOSCOW,"EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA, MOSCOW, 00000, RUSSIA",1994-5124,2411-2658,,EKONOMICHESKAYA POLI,EKONOMICHESKAYA POLIT.,OCT,2021,16,5,,,,,96,117,,10.18288/1994-5124-2021-5-96-117,http://dx.doi.org/10.18288/1994-5124-2021-5-96-117,,,22,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,XU5XO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000734337500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considering the complete lack of applied research on the brand-performance relationship for farmer cooperatives, it is unknown if branding is even profitable. This paper addresses the gap in our understanding with a novel panel study of 707 US marketing cooperatives for the 2005-2011 period. Informed by lagged observations of trademark and service mark data, the empirical analysis indicates a positive relationship of brand equity to the financial performance of marketing cooperatives. Specifically, 1% increases in the total stock of trademarks and service marks have a positive impact of $130,441 and $141,921, respectively, on the net sales of the mean marketing cooperative. The corresponding impact on net income is estimated at $3,815 and $17,286, respectively. Following the estimation of further specifications, there is also indication most of the impact is facilitated by older trademarks (>3 years) in the stock, which implies a delayed impact of brand equity on financial performance. Overall, the reported evidence serves as motivation to directors and managers of marketing cooperatives to pursue opportunities to build brand equity. To do so, however, may first require a solution to the equity constraint which appears at the foundation of most farmer cooperatives.","[Grashuis, Jasper] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, 143C Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Grashuis, J (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, 143C Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grashuisj@missouri.edu,,"Grashuis, Jasper/0000-0002-5075-4439",,,,,51,14,16,8,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,APR,2019,35,2,,,,,234,248,,10.1002/agr.21574,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.21574,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,HW0WC,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000466401800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Norway, alongside mandatory quotas regulating the composition of Public Limited Company boards, voluntary quotas were designed to increase women's membership on the boards of agricultural co-operatives. This radical step to secure a minimum of 40 per cent women makes these boards an interesting site for investigating the construction of gender in a traditionally male-dominated organization. In the debate, arguments in favour of a quota accentuated diversity and differences between women's and men's competences, opinions and values. The analysis of interview data from the boards of four agricultural co-operatives suggests that equal representation is a muted, taken-for-granted value. Equality and diversity are not understood as incompatible ideas, and gender is produced dynamically through practice rather than constituted as an inherent, fixed attribute. Gender as difference is less pervasive than expected as women tend to be recognized as belonging to the gender-neutral category of a board representative despite any recognized differences. The study demonstrates that voluntary quotas may change the context and both challenge old assumptions and promote new understandings of gender in local situations.","[Brandth, Berit] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Sociol, Trondheim, Norway; [Bjorkhaug, Hilde] Norwegian Ctr Rural Research, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Bjorkhaug, H (corresponding author), Univ Dragvoll, Ctr Rural Res, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",hilde.bjorkhaug@rural.no,"Brandth, Berit/Q-4511-2019","Bjorkhaug, Hilde/0000-0002-3933-2788",Research Council of Norway [177628],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This study was funded by the Research Council of Norway (Project no 177628: Power and Privilege, Meaning and Management - Gender in the Board Room).",,53,11,11,1,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-6673,1468-0432,,GENDER WORK ORGAN,Gend.

Financial performance, measured using ROE (return on equity), was decomposed to three contributing factors, viz., profitability, asset efficiency, and financial leverage. Linear regression and quantile regression analyses were employed to respectively estimate the conditional mean and conditional quantiles. Profitability was found to be the strongest driver of ROE. Asset efficiency and financial leverage were also positive contributors to ROE. An alternative regression model was carried out, where the financial performance construct ROE was replaced with ROA (return on assets). The findings suggest that increasing leverage leads to decreasing performance, contradicting the earlier results. This implies that whether leverage hurts or benefits performance can depend on the variable choice. Employed as control variables, location and age were found to be associated with performance. In particular, the cooperatives in the central region, in general, appeared to have the lowest financial performance. The study empirically pointed out that negative equity led to violations of the ordinal and interpretable properties of ROE. Thus, ROE components should be carefully examined. Regarding cooperative management policy, cooperatives should concentrate on both operating and financial performances with the priority given to profitability, which involves the efficiencies of cost and sales management.","[Ngamjan, Prajya] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Liberal Arts & Management Sci, Chalermphrakiat Sakonnakhon Prov Campus, Muang 47000, Sakonnakhon, Thailand; [Buranasiri, Jiroj] Thammasat Univ, Innovat Coll, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Buranasiri, J (corresponding author), Thammasat Univ, Innovat Coll, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",prachya.ng@ku.th; jirojb@gmail.com,,,"Faculty of Liberal Arts and Management Science, Kasetsart University, Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province Campus","Faculty of Liberal Arts and Management Science, Kasetsart University, Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province Campus","The first author would like to acknowledge the research grant provided by the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Management Science, Kasetsart University, Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province Campus.",,31,2,2,1,11,UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA PRESS,SELANGOR,"SERDANG, SELANGOR, 00000, MALAYSIA",0128-7702,2231-8534,,PERTANIKA J SOC SCI,Pertanika J.

Availability of capital is limited if farmers do not have incentives to increase their capital contribution. Cooperative literature recognizes the residual rights, transferability, and the appreciation potential of the investment as the potential solutions for the problems that may impede cooperative investments. The objective of this study is to understand farmer preferences regarding investment attributes and the potential for attracting investment capital from members and non-members. We employ a choice experiment method to test new cooperative investment instruments. The data consist of a questionnaire conducted with 406 Finnish dairy farmers. Random parameter latent class logit model is used in the estimation of the data. The results indicate that most of the respondents regard the new investment instruments positively. However, farmers prefer restricting ownership rights to members. Incentives for members to participate in financing cooperative growth could be designed with capital-based residual rights, mechanisms for transferability and for the appreciation of firm value. Estimation that considered choice difficulty improved model fit, which highlights the need to address respondent burden also in future studies of hypothetical investments in order to produce unbiased estimates.","[Alho, Eeva] Pellervo Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",,"Alho, E (corresponding author), Pellervo Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland.",eeva.alho@ptt.fi,,,,,,,58,4,4,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

The main purpose of the wine cooperatives is to support the member businesses with the highest possible payouts for their grapes. Wine cooperatives can fulfil this purpose by implementing a differentiation strategy. On the one hand, brands can be used for differentiation. On the other hand, cooperatives can use particular values in the communication with customers that correspond to the target group's values. Based on the definition of the International Co-operative Alliance, cooperatives are a sustainable form of enterprise. Therefore, the question arises whether it is possible to use sustainability as a value that corresponds to cooperatives as a form of enterprise as well as to a strong societal value that gains importance. Which role does social capital play in the context of social sustainability? The aim of this paper is to shed light on the understanding of brands, to show which cooperative-specific characteristics might pose a challenge to cooperatives in terms of brand management and to examine the understanding of the sustainability construct as well as sustainable management practices applied by wine cooperatives to date.

However, impact evaluations regarding the contribution of cooperatives are limited; evaluation results are mixed and are not conclusive. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the determinants and economic impacts of cooperative membership using household survey data gathered from coffee farmers in the Jimma Zone of Oromia, Ethiopia. A propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) models are used to estimate treatment effects by controlling for selection biases. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through group discussions made with randomly selected farmers in the study area. Findings indicate that the probability of farmers' membership decision increases with age, education level, family size, social networks, land property and accessibility to cooperatives. Both PSM and ESR models show that membership is positively associated with household income and assets. The ESR estimation results further confirm that members economically perform significantly better than if they had not been members and nonmembers would have even performed better than members if they had joined cooperatives. The results of group discussions also verify overall direct and spill-over effects, though cooperative services to members and non-members are undifferentiated. The results indicate a need for a mechanism to enhance the participation of poorer farm households, and to further improve member benefits as potential areas in making cooperatives more meaningful, attractive and sustainable.

Multilevel viability problems are rarely studied since they induce combinatorial explosion (the set of N agents each evolving in a p-dimensional state space, can evolve in a Np dimensional state space). In this article, we propose an original approach which consists in solving first local viability problems and then studying the real viability of the combination of the local strategies, by simulation where necessary. In this article, we consider as multilevel viability problem a stylized agricultural cooperative which has to keep a minimum of members. Members have an economical constraint and some members have a simple model of the functioning of the cooperative and make assumptions on other members' behavior, especially proviable agents which are concerned about their own viability. In this framework, the model assumptions allow us to solve the local viability problem at the agent level. At the cooperative level, considering mixture of agents, simulation results indicate if and when including proviable agents increases the viability of the whole cooperative.

Leadership was analysed from multiple perspectives using an explanatory sequential mixed approach involving quantitative and qualitative methods. We interviewed 293 cooperative leaders and members. The partial least squares structural equation model was used to examine the relationship between multiple constructs and variables. We concluded that leaders do differ in some of their characteristics from other members. They are the most active in the group, influencing all major decisions, playing a crucial role in trust-building and group cohesion. Their skills and leadership style are significantly important for members' commitment to the group's success. However, the dominance of group founders and lack of understanding of cooperative principles among members indicate some emerging challenges to the cooperatives' sustainability and efficiency, and it is necessary to focus on the progressive professionalization and capacity building of leaders while maintaining a transformational leadership style.","[Hejkrlik, Jiri; Chaloupkova, Petra] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Dept Econ & Dev, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sokolska, Tetyana] Bila Tserkva Natl Agr Univ, Dept Publ Management Adm & Int Econ, Bila Tserkva, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Chaloupkova, P (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",chaloupkova@ftz.czu.cz,"Hejkrlik, Jiri/L-9689-2013","Hejkrlik, Jiri/0000-0002-1337-5261; Chaloupkova, Petra/0000-0002-7527-9961",,,,,51,4,4,4,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

To test the hypotheses, the structural equation modeling technique was applied. Findings - The results show that cooperative behavior positively and significantly influences risk management and knowledge sharing; however, no statistical significance was found in the relationship between risk management and knowledge sharing. This indicates that higher levels of cooperative behavior are reflected in greater risk management, which helps to mitigate risks, and in greater knowledge sharing in the cooperatives studied.Practical & social implications of research - It presents new information relating to cooperative behavior and risk management in knowledge sharing in cooperatives that integrate strategic alliances.

Certified, elder and educated farmers who have off-farm income and trust in the cooperative leadership have been found to side-sell significantly less. Nonetheless, cooperative group size and late payment favoured more side selling.

Registered as a limited liability company, the center provides long-term product storage, product preparation for the market, and sales management. Despite a small share of ownership and management of this distribution company, fruit and vegetable producers benefit from increased sales security, extended sales periods, and secure collection. DCVP assures customers of higher product quality, which, combined with the extended selling period, leads to the increased selling price. Over the period 2009-2019, DCVP steadily increased its total assets by keeping its gearing ratio below 50%. DCVP reduces the number of days to collect receivables and the number of days to pay suppliers, i.e., farmers. A satisfactory liquidity level is achieved during the observed period, but the center's profitability is low. The average ROA during 2015-2019 is 0.07%. However, it should be emphasized that this institution's primary objective is not to maximize profits but to ensure a better position of small producers of fruits and vegetables in the market. The interviews conducted show a high level of satisfaction of the co-owners and the management with the center's achievements so far. Based on the results, we conclude that the DCVP is an excellent example for future public-private cooperation projects to increase domestic fruit and vegetable producers' competitiveness. The main recommendation for future projects is to involve producers in the decision-making process and develop accompanying activities to train farmers in new technologies and strengthen farmers' cooperation.","[Juracak, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Zagreb, Croatia; [Brckovic, Gordana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Brkic, Nenad] Univ Sarajevo, Fac Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Zagreb; University of Rijeka; University of Sarajevo,"Juracak, J (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Zagreb, Croatia.",jjuracak@agr.hr; gordanabrckovic@gmail.com; nenad.brkic@efsa.unsa.ba,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2021,,,,,,,361,378,,,,,,18,Business; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BS0DJ,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000681139700018,View Full Record in Web of Science

These data justify the need to analyze the cooperative principles in the success of agricultural cooperatives in Zulia State. The research was conducted in the counties located at the South of Maracaibo's Lake, a questionnaire to 51 cooperatives and interview to cooperative specialists were applied. Overall rate of success factors (IGFE), index review of success factors (IOE), and the index of productive activities (IAP) which have been subjected to correlation and means tests: success rates were constructed. The results emphasize that the principles with high average values and statistical significance in successful cooperatives are democratic management (0.7059), equal economic participation of partners (0.5233), education, training and information (0.4560), cooperation between cooperatives (0.4882) and commitment to the communities (0.3331). A significant correlation (P<0.01) between the IGFE (0.598) and IOE (0.598) with the dependent variable IAP was observed.

However, there is limited evidence regarding the effects of cooperative membership on women. In this paper, we evaluate impacts of membership in women-only and mixed-gender cooperatives in South India on women's intra-household decision-making power, using data of 313 female milk producers. Propensity score matching and a two-step control function approach are employed to account for selection bias due to observed and unobserved factors. We find that membership in either women-only or mixed-gender cooperatives has a positive impact on intra-household decision-making power. In particular, members of mixed-gender cooperatives gain significantly more power over decisions regarding dairy production, compared to members of women-only cooperatives. We conclude that women-only cooperatives are not more effective for women's empowerment than mixed-gender cooperatives. However, because women have limited access to mixed-gender cooperatives, women-only cooperatives are generally more accessible for the majority of them.","[Dohmwirth, Carla] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Liu, Ziming] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Social & Publ Adm, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China",Humboldt University of Berlin; East China University of Science & Technology,"Liu, ZM (corresponding author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Social & Publ Adm, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",ziming.liu@ecust.edu.cn,"Liu, Ziming/ADZ-7749-2022","Liu, Ziming/0000-0002-8867-2682",Stiftung fiat panis of Germany; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [18YJC790110],Stiftung fiat panis of Germany; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China,This work was supported by the Stiftung fiat panis of Germany and the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China under grant [18YJC790110].,,58,19,19,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1943-9342,1943-9407,,J DEV EFFECT,j Dev.

Interviews were conducted with district council members and representatives from the boards of directors. The data from both case cooperatives indicate a genuinely traditional democratic member governance structure. There is a great deal of social capital in the governance system. A tentative explanation of the member involvement is that the cooperatives' equity capital is owned by the individual members, and the members are free to sell and buy their shares at a market rate. The members are satisfied with the return on the capital they have invested in the cooperatives. They receive bonus shares and dividends above what most members would get in other investments. A conclusion is that very large cooperatives may succeed well with a member-democratic governance system of the traditional cooperative type, which in this case is probably due to the members' satisfaction with the individualized ownership of the cooperatives.","[Hakelius, Karin; Nilsson, Jerker] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Hakelius, K (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",karin.hakelius@slu.se; jerker.nilsson@slu.se,,"Hakelius, Karin/0000-0002-1738-6267",,,,,63,3,4,6,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,21,,,,,,,9073,10.3390/su12219073,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12219073,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OR2TW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000589328800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results indicate a strong relationship between the social networks and the farmers' propensity to participate in cooperative governance. This relationship has persisted even though the investigated 20-year period was very turbulent for Swedish agriculture. Over time, members have become more willing to be elected when they receive backing from their social networks, with personal networks being more important than professional networks.

One of the biggest problems arising from joining financial goals with social goals is the presence of increasing tensions between the members and stakeholders involved. Nevertheless, there has not been enough focus on how managers, employees, and stakeholders respond to the tensions caused by contradictions and how they try to reach a balance between financial, environmental, and social goals. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating how members of an agricultural cooperative in the Apulia region (Italy) try to join the organizational forms of business and social values, namely, the sustainable practices related to CO2 emission reduction, resource use efficiency, and food waste mitigation. Additionally, the study goes further and explores whether and how these contradictory pressures are solved. Starting from the sensemaking approach, the study carried out an inductive case study through the use of a multiple case study design and in-depth interviews. The findings highlight the following two novel aspects: (1) Managers prefer to adopt a cumulative mitigating hybridization approach and (2) a weak integration can be noticed between social and commercial dimensions, originating from a lack of holistic perspective and poor interorganizational communication.","[Pellegrini, Giustina; Conto, Francesco; Fiore, Mariantonietta] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy; [Annosi, Maria Carmela] Wageningen Univ & Res, Business Management Org, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Foggia; Wageningen University & Research,"Pellegrini, G (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",giustina.pellegrini@unifg.it; maria.annosi@wur.nl; francesco.conto@unifg.it; mariantonietta.fiore@unifg.it,"Pellegrini, Giustina/IST-6268-2023",,Fondazione Puglia; (Project `Gestione Integrata della Filiera e del Trasporto degli scarti (GIFTS) dell'ortofrutta),Fondazione Puglia; (Project `Gestione Integrata della Filiera e del Trasporto degli scarti (GIFTS) dell'ortofrutta),"This research received external funding by Fondazione Puglia (agreement with the Department of Economics of 11 March 2019), Project `Gestione Integrata della Filiera e del Trasporto degli scarti (GIFTS) dell'ortofrutta).",,15,14,14,2,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,3050,10.3390/su12073050,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12073050,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000531558100475,View Full Record in Web of Science

The empirical basis was a survey of farmers in Finland. Findings from limited dependent variable regression models suggest that the farmers who are most loyal to their cooperatives tend to oppose its foreign investments. Another group of farmers tended to switch membership status between different cooperatives, and a third group tended to opt out of cooperatives. The two latter categories were characterised by a lower level of social capital, and both of them welcomed the cooperatives' international operations. This finding was more significant for individual farm types than the social capital-linked opposition to internationalisation. A general conclusion is that the internationalisation of cooperatives seems to affect the members' trust in the cooperative differently. Thus there is increasing heterogeneity within the memberships which may give rise to governance problems.","[Ollila, Petri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Nilsson, Jerker; Hess, Sebastian] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Helsinki; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ollila, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, PL 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.ollila@helsinki.fi,"Hess, Sebastian/ADS-1491-2022","Hess, Sebastian/0000-0002-4597-7654",,,,,55,5,5,2,18,SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURAL SOC FINLAND,Lemu,"Joensuuntie 290, Lemu, FINLAND",1459-6067,1795-1895,,AGR FOOD SCI,Agr.

Primary data were obtained from 59 active and 14 inactive cooperatives in the selected districts. The study concludes that Ghanaian cooperatives in the sample bear much resemblance to the traditional form which emerged in Europe and North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Generally, such cooperatives have relatively small memberships from local communities who use a democratic governance system and do not delegate control to outsiders. While the cost of owning and transacting is limited with such characteristics, many traditional cooperatives lack the specific knowledge, economic efficiency, and resource endowment necessary to become or remain competitive. Indeed, the active cooperatives listed finance, access to inputs, tractor services and poor leadership as key challenges, while inactive cooperatives blamed poor member commitment as the primary culprit for their inactivity. Efforts aimed at promoting and supporting farmer cooperatives should focus on addressing these key challenges. Also, financial and technical support should probably be conditional on group performance and not group formation itself.","[Dary, Stanley Kojo] Simon Diedong Dombo Univ Business & Integrated De, Wa 00233, Upper West Regi, Ghana; [Grashuis, Jasper] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Dary, SK (corresponding author), Simon Diedong Dombo Univ Business & Integrated De, Wa 00233, Upper West Regi, Ghana.",sdary@uds.edu.gh,,"Dary, Stanley/0000-0002-9844-1685",,,,,34,5,5,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Encouraging farmers to self-organize was regarded as a useful tool to enhance the adoption of agricultural product certifications in Taiwan. However, previous studies solely focused on the association between membership in a production organization and single food certifications. Moreover, little is known of how different types of organizational participation could improve the adoption of agricultural product certifications. This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by employing multinomial logistic regression model (MNL) to investigate factors affecting farmers' decisions to participate in agricultural product certification. Special attention is paid to the role of different types of organizational participation in farmers' choices for agricultural product certification. The study used a nationally representative sample of core farmers in Taiwan, and its results revealed evident differences in farmers' organization types. For example, the farm operators who participate in agricultural cooperatives (co-ops) tend to use organic labels. In contrast, farm operators who participate in agricultural production and marketing groups (APMGs) tend to adopt the Traceable Agricultural Products (TAP) label. Moreover, age, education level, farming experience, farm labor, farm type, agricultural facilities, and regional location have a significant effect on farmers' choices for participating in agricultural product certification across different models. The findings suggest that policymakers should consider these differences in the organizational operation of APMGs and co-ops and provide customized measures by promoting different types of agricultural product certifications.","[Kuan, Mei-Yin; Wang, Jiun-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioind Commun & Dev, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Wang, Szu-Yung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Wang, JH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioind Commun & Dev, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",mikayla571@gmail.com; d05724006@ntu.edu.tw; wangjh@ntu.edu.tw,,"Wang, Jiun-Hao/0000-0001-7861-0341; MEI-YIN, KUAN/0000-0003-0404-3553",,,,,59,2,2,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,16,,,,,,,9429,10.3390/su13169429,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13169429,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UH7BP,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000690081700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, the design principles have been generalised to study human groups in other collective action scenarios, including farm producers who collectively buy inputs or sell outputs. Several case studies have conceptualised farmer cooperatives as common property institutions to study how various collective action scenarios have been approached. We contribute to the scarce literature with a field study in the Upper West Region of Ghana, using Ostrom's framework to compare the design principles of active and inactive farmer cooperatives. Using the mean group comparison method, we find numerous significant differences as active farmer cooperatives have clearer boundaries, require more capital investments, have more active board directors and managers, receive more governmental support, and have more locations. However, not all design principles are significantly different for active and inactive cooperatives (e.g. sanctions, legal rights). Considering our results, we perceive opportunities to formalise the conceptualisation of farmer cooperatives as common property institutions with both internal and external design principles. Our results also have policy implications in terms of top-down initiatives to spur collective action by Ghanaian farm producers.","[Grashuis, Jasper] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Dary, Stanley Kojo] Simon Diedong Dombo Univ Business & Integrated De, Wa, Ghana",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Grashuis, J (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grashuisj@missouri.edu,,"Dary, Stanley/0000-0002-9844-1685",,,,,56,1,1,3,13,"IGITUR, UTRECHT PUBLISHING & ARCHIVING SERVICES",URTRECHT,"POSTBUS 80124, URTRECHT, 3508 TC, NETHERLANDS",1875-0281,,,INT J COMMONS,Int.

The results showed that 65.68% of the differences were caused by individual-level factors, and 34.32% were caused by provincial-level factors. The factors at the individual level, including the improvement of production equipment (WE), education of farmers (EOF), regularization of management rules (RMR), and difficulty level of getting loans (DLL), had positive effects on growth of family farm, whereas the frequency of staff participating in training (FST) had a negative effect. At provincial level, improvement of the support policy system (IDSPS) could strengthen the positive correlation between RMR and growth of family farm. Moreover, the factor IDSPS combined with ability of agricultural cooperatives providing social services (AACPS) and spacious degree of technology access channel (SDTAC) could strengthen the positive correlation between EOF and growth of family farm, and reduced the negative correlation between FST and dependent variable.

Members' preference structures are affected by business size and attitudes towards risk. [EconLit Citations: Q130, M000, C400].

I argue that the state's modernist project of development placed the burden of cooperative members' transformation into model revolutionaries on individual will rather than on national and global political-economic relations. This resulted in Tulenos' inability to live up to Sandinista expectations and authorized the production of Sandinista and academic discourses that cast these producers as failed revolutionaries.

Empirical results from a sample of Spanish fruit and vegetable firms for the period between 2009 and 2012 reveal different adjustment processes of current, debt, and return on assets ratios between cooperatives and IOFs. We find significant differences between these firms, with slower adjustment rates for current and debt ratios in cooperatives. These findings may arise from the weakness associated with ownership structure in cooperatives, which reduces their adjustment processes compared to those of IOFs. The identification of differences in adjustment processes between cooperatives and IOFs may provide us with additional information regarding the specific management characteristics of these agri-food firms, thus identifying those firms that are most dependent on external market conditions.","[Martinez-Victoria, MCarmen] Tech Univ Cartagena, Business Econ Dept, Fac Business Adm, Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain; [Sanchez Val, Mariluz Mate] Tech Univ Cartagena, Finance & Accounting Dept, Fac Business Adm, Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain; [Arcas Lario, Narciso] Tech Univ Cartagena, Business Econ Dept, Paseo Alfonso XIII 48, Cartagena 30203, Murcia, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Martinez-Victoria, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Cartagena, Business Econ Dept, Fac Business Adm, Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain.",mluz.mate@upct.es; arcas.lario@upct.es; mdc.mvictoria@gmail.com,"Mate, Mariluz/H-2131-2015","Mate, Mariluz/0000-0002-9805-6365; Martinez-Victoria, MCarmen/0000-0003-3964-2759","Catedra Cajamar de Cooperativismo Agroalimentario, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Seneca Foundation [19884/GERM/15]","Catedra Cajamar de Cooperativismo Agroalimentario, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Catedra Cajamar de Cooperativismo Agroalimentario, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, and from Seneca Foundation.

The results of the survey show that male, middle-aged, and middle-class farmers or farmers who plant local optimal crops are more likely to become the members of cooperatives. There is a huge gap between service supply and demand of farmers; cooperatives have a positive effect on reducing the degree of service demand. This effect is only significant when concerning sale, pest control, and mechanization.

This amount was 3.08% of the average annual agricultural income calculated. About 41.22% of the participants showed no WTP. They believed that the public sector is accountable of the services and consequently, they should be provided free of charge. About 23.14% of the participants showed WTP only for the services that they needed. The average WTP for all participants was calculated as 40.9 TL/ha ($7.21/ha) and 1.2 million $/year for the GAP-Harran Plain. This amount is the minimum and may increase by several folds with a demand-based variety of service delivery. The factors that statistically effect WTP have been determined as age, education, experience, number of households working in agriculture, amount of land, agricultural income, non-agricultural income, membership status of agricultural cooperatives, and product pattern. The results provide useful information to guide researchers, decision-makers, and policy-makers.","[Dogan, Hatice Parlakci; Aydogdu, Mustafa Hakki] Harran Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-63050 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Sevinc, Mehmet Resit] Harran Univ, Dept Bozova Voc Sch, TR-63850 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Cancelik, Mehmet] Harran Univ, Dept Social Sci, Voc Sch, TR-63200 Sanliurfa, Turkey",Harran University; Harran University; Harran University,"Sevinç, MR (corresponding author), Harran Univ, Dept Bozova Voc Sch, TR-63850 Sanliurfa, Turkey.",hparlakcidogan@yahoo.com; mhaydogdu@hotmail.com; rsevinc@harran.edu.tr; m.cancelik@harran.edu.tr,"SEV?NÇ, MEHMET RE??T/AAG-6695-2019; cançelik, mehmet/ABF-7714-2020; AYDOGDU, MUSTAFA HAKKI/ABF-9877-2020","SEV?NÇ, MEHMET RE??T/0000-0002-0617-7822; AYDOGDU, MUSTAFA HAKKI/0000-0002-4945-5239; CANCELIK, MEHMET/0000-0001-8158-4455; Parlakci Dogan, Hatice/0000-0002-2186-3505",,,,,66,7,7,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,MAY,2020,10,5,,,,,,,152,10.3390/agriculture10050152,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10050152,,,16,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,LY9MH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000540851700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

These generalizations are only possible through refinement of frameworks currently used in the study of heterogeneity and common pool resource management.

Knowledge management contributes to the development of agribusinesses. The objective of this study is to analyze knowledge management practices in the supply chain of broilers at the level of farmers and compare the differences between farmers who are members of cooperatives, and those who are suppliers of firms. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a sample of broiler farmers (n = 240, where 80 respondents are associated with cooperatives) from Brazil, descriptive statistics were used to measure the four knowledge management dimensions (leadership, people, process and technology). The Mann-Whitney test was performed to verify the difference in the adoption of knowledge management practices between farmers who are members of cooperatives, and those who are suppliers of firms. Findings The results showed significant differences between the analyzed groups of broiler farmers that are members of an agricultural cooperative and suppliers of firms. Farmers who supply firms adopt knowledge management practices with greater intensity. They are also more technified and have a larger scale of production. Research limitations/implications The study was conducted in a single agribusiness chain. Future studies may look at another method of knowledge management assessment to see if the results will be similar. Practical implications The results can contribute to the development of programs and policies, incorporating knowledge management into agribusiness as a competitive strategy. Originality/value While knowledge management is a widely studied topic, there has been little focus on this subject with regard to agribusiness. Empirical findings of an important agribusiness supply chain are provided and show the differences in knowledge management perceptions between farmers who are members of cooperatives and those who are suppliers of firms.","[da Silva Zanuzzi, Cinthya Monica; Selig, Paulo Mauricio] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Foguesatto, Cristian Rogerio] Unisinos Univ, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Tonial, Graciele] Univ West Santa Catarina, Dept Adm, Joacaba, Brazil; [Pivoto, Dieisson] Fac Merid IMED, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade do Oeste de Santa Catarina,"Zanuzzi, CMD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",cinthyamsz01@gmail.com,"Foguesatto, Cristian/ABF-8870-2021","Zanuzzi, Cinthya Monica da Silva/0000-0001-6569-9981; Tonial, Graciele/0000-0001-5137-035X",,,,,60,2,2,2,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0306-8293,1758-6712,,INT J SOC ECON,Int.

Agricultural cooperatives can serve as an institutional vehicle for policymakers to deliver direct benefits to smallholder farmers in the form of subsidized agricultural inputs, usually improved seed varieties and fertilizers. They can also serve as platforms for collective action through which smallholders can reduce transportation and transaction costs or disperse the costs of marketing. In Zambia farmers are required to join a cooperative to qualify for seed and fertilizer support through the national Farmer Input Support Program (FISP), which is a structural incentive for cooperative membership and makes it complicated to determine if cooperative membership increases use of inputs and yields on its own. Using the Inverse Probability Weight Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) technique, we find Zambian smallholders participating in cooperatives achieve significantly higher maize yields and use significantly more hybrid-maize seed and fertilizers, even when controlling for FISP eligibility. Furthermore, across all selected productivity and input variables we find greater average treatment effects from cooperative membership than FISP participation. Cooperative membership is also associated with more assets, more land, and higher maize yields, which suggests that the poorest rural households are often not cooperative members. Cooperatives can be a powerful poverty policy tool to deliver direct benefits to small farmers, but not including the poorest households likely widens the rural poverty gap, both in terms of limited direct benefits of input support programs and in terms of farmers missing out on cooperative-specific benefits.

This model is used to explore farmer learning mechanisms and to simulate the bounded rational decisions made by farmer households.

After comparing the differences between actual land-use changes from 2007 to 2009 and the simulation results, we analyze the validity of the model and discuss the potential and limitations of the farmer land-use decision-making model under three scenarios. Based on the design and implementation of the model, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the CA-BDI framework is an appropriate model for exploring learning mechanisms and simulating bounded rational decisions; and (2) local governments should encourage scallion planting by assisting scallion farmer cooperatives and farmers to understand the market risk, standardize the rules of their cooperation, and supervise the contracts made between scallion cooperatives and farmers.","[Liang, Xiaoying; Chen, Hai; Wang, Yanni; Song, Shixiong] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an,"Chen, H (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",chw@nwu.edu.cn,"Jiang, Tao/IWM-7503-2023; ?, ??/IUP-7329-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271103, 40901093]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China [11JK0744]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41271103 and 40901093), Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China (Grant No. 11JK0744).

The social capital concept is integrated with cooperative lifecycle theory to describe the change of cooperative social capital along the lifecycle. We propose that cooperatives in different stages of the lifecycle are featured with different levels of social capital. Cooperatives usually enjoy a high level of social capital in the early stages of the lifecycle. However, the level of social capital in cooperatives exhibits a declining trend along the development of the organization. The decrease of social capital will lead to an imbalance of the social and economic attributes of cooperatives. The cooperative's governance structure must change accordingly. We argue that it is important for cooperatives to maintain and develop the social capital strategically over time. Otherwise, the comparative advantage of the cooperative business form may disappear.","[Deng, Wendong] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Hendrikse, George] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Liang, Qiao] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Publ Affairs, Yuhangtang 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Zhejiang University,"Liang, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Publ Affairs, Yuhangtang 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wdeng@rsm.nl; ghendrikse@rsm.nl; liangqiao2323@126.com,,"Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY19G030030]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573227],Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. LY19G030030) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71573227).,,110,14,15,9,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

To this end, it employs a dynamic game where an investor-owned firm (IOF) competes with a farmers' processing cooperative which incurs a fixed coordination cost per member. The results indicate that as the value of coordination cost per member increases or the processing margin rises, it becomes more likely for the IOF to use cooperative limit pricing, that is, to deter the cooperative's market entry. The opposite is true for an increase in the freight rate.","[Fousekis, Panos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Fousekis, P (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece.",panosfousekis@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

This research aims to identify and characterise different types of business models that create value from agricultural waste and by-products via cascading or closing loops. Conceptual and management insights into circular business models are still sparse. In total, 39 cases have been studied that convert agro-waste and by-products into valuable products via a circular economy approach. Semi-structured interviews and on-site visits of six representative cases have been done, and secondary data been collected. Data has been treated with content analysis. Cases are presented according to the type of organisational structure, resources, transformation processes, value propositions, key partners, customers, strategic approaches and innovation. Six types of circular business models are identified and discussed: biogas plant, upcycling entrepreneurship, environmental biorefinery, agricultural cooperative, agropark and support structure. They differ in their way of value creation and organisational form, but strongly depend on partnerships and their capacity to respond to changing external conditions. This study offers the first circular business model typology within the agricultural domain, revealing the interconnectedness of the six different business model types. It provides options for managers in positioning and adapting their business strategies. It highlights the potential of using biomass first for higher added-value products before exploiting it as energy source. Cascading biomass valorisation at a territorial level will increasingly be important for locally cooperating actors within a circular bioeconomy approach. (C) 2020 The Authors.

We develop a model to show that, in technologies with numerous sequential steps, even small shortfalls in worker effort can result in large output declines. Using data on cooperative and private farms in El Salvador, we find greater shortfalls in efficiency between cooperatives and private farms, as well as among cooperatives, for coffee, a crop requiring numerous steps in its cultivation, than for maize and sugar, which require fewer steps. Thus the undersupply of effort in cooperatives may be less than differences in productivity suggest, and cooperative agriculture is most likely to be successful where production does not involve many sequential steps.","[Ahn, Seung C.; Brada, Josef C.; Mendez, Jose A.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Ahn, Seung C.] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Sogang University,"Brada, JC (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",josef.brada@asu.edu,,,,,,,30,12,12,1,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

In this study, DEA is used as a managerial audit tool to identify and measure inefficiencies among a set of 73 independent decision-making units within one federation of the Caisses Populaires Desjardins in Quebec. The DEA results were compared with the federation's traditional accounting ratio measures. Management found that the DEA results confirmed most of their intuition on which units were unprofitable, and also pinpointed units that made a profit but were operationally inefficient. Overall, they agree with our results and on the benefits of using DEA to complement their accounting ratio analysis for improving the efficiency of some of their caisses.","Univ Quebec, Sch Business, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Sch Business & Econ, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA; Univ Quebec, Dept Accounting, Hull, PQ J8X 3X73, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Plattsburgh; University of Quebec,"Sedzro, K (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Sch Business, POB 8888,Stn Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",sedzro.k@uqam.ca,,,,,,,42,5,5,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0315-5986,1916-0615,,INFOR,Infor,NOV,2004,42,4,,,,,281,297,,,,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Operations Research & Management Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,016JZ,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000235617800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The divergence is puzzling given strong similarities in Japan and Korea's agricultural sectors and institutions. Electoral competition that accentuates the urban-rural divide in society works in favor of centralized farm political mobilization, whereas electoral competition that minimizes the urban-rural divide works in favor of decentralized farm political mobilization. The logic is that when electoral competition cuts across the urban-rural cleavage, farmers face greater challenges in mobilizing under a centralized farm group for electoral purposes. Simply put, farmers are unable to act as a unified voting bloc. Relatedly, political parties also face less electoral incentives to specifically target farmers as a unified voting bloc.","[Oh, Jennifer S.] Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, 52 Ewhayeodaegil, Seoul 03760, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Oh, JS (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, 52 Ewhayeodaegil, Seoul 03760, South Korea.",Jenn.oh@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,58,0,0,5,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0891-4486,1573-3416,,INT J POLITICS CULT,Int.

This created new market income opportunities for dairy processors, but also fostered the necessity for investments to access these markets. A literature review sees cooperatives to be disadvantaged at this point, because their organisational structure hinders their access to external financial resources. Confronted with these equity constraints, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how German dairy marketing cooperatives adapted to the new business environment and have been performing from 2000 to 2012. Design/methodology/approach - An approach combining descriptive data from public sources and financial ratio analysis was used to test hypotheses, derived from Transaction Cost Theory. Findings - Contrary to assumptions, cooperatives gained market shares on the German dairy market. However, dairy cooperatives managed to overcome the internal equity constraints only partially via mergers, which intensified structural change. Focusing on cost leadership, German cooperatives were not able to successfully diversify their product portfolio and still operate mainly in the fluid, low margins dairy market segments. Frustrated by their diminishing influence on the decision making process in the vastly grown cooperatives, a majority of farmers cancelled their cooperative membership. Practical implications - Until today an absolute turning point for the cooperative organisational form has not yet occurred, but if cooperatives do not find the means to invest more heavily in the new markets, a slow decline of cooperatives is expected. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the existing literature on marketing cooperatives by providing insights on the performance of cooperatives through combination of from theory derived assumptions with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods.","[Grau, Aaron; Hockmann, Heinrich; Levkovych, Inna] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Mkt & World Agr Trade, Agr Markets, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Grau, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Mkt & World Agr Trade, Agr Markets, Halle, Saale, Germany.",grau@iamo.de,"Grau, Aaron/HMV-1764-2023; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Levkvoych, Inna/AAE-2690-2019",", IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665;",,,,,46,3,3,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, less work has examined the role of symbolic values in these processes. Drawing on extensive fieldwork, this research examines the relationship between value and identity frames and resource access in three food and agriculture cooperatives that aim for community improvement. We find that as cultural and symbolic power become concentrated, diverse cultural values, and the potential resources they represent, can become more difficult to enact. While sustained dialog during a frame process can help bridge diverse resources, additional resources are often needed to support such activities. Our work suggests that frames are related to resource access, that they can be in tension with each other, do not always reflect practice, and may help reorganize capitals access.","[Hale, James] Univ Otago, Ctr Sustainabil, 563 Castle St N, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Carolan, Michael] Colorado State Univ, Dept Sociol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Otago; Colorado State University,"Hale, J (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Ctr Sustainabil, 563 Castle St N, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.",james.hale@otago.ac.nz,,"Hale, James/0000-0002-4144-9117","U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NIFA-COL00725]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016A3A2924243]","U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [grant number NIFA-COL00725] and Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [grant number NRF-2016A3A2924243].",,24,7,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1557-5330,1944-7485,,COMMUNITY DEV,Community Dev.,,2018,49,4,,,,,360,379,,10.1080/15575330.2018.1491614,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15575330.2018.1491614,,,20,Development Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Development Studies,GO7DE,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000440215500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

While these cooperatives have been widely successful in boosting agricultural commercialization among rural smallholders in China, their potential has not yet been recognized in the African context. To fill this gap, we present and discuss a theoretical framework based on recent literature, an in-depth case study from Uganda and quantitative analyses of data on horticultural cooperatives from Senegal and agricultural and livestock cooperatives from Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Rwanda and Kenya. We uncover the existence of cooperatives built on land sharing schemes in different parts of Africa and especially in Rwanda.

The main purpose of this empirical study is to investigate the most important factors that motivate Greek producers to participate in marketing cooperatives, as well as those motives that discourage them. The prefecture of Imathia, in the northern part of Greece, was chosen because it is characterized by a high involvement of cooperatives, wholesalers and retailers in F&V trading. A structured questionnaire was answered by 61 producers of Imathia in 2020. The results indicate that producers recognize that they ensure safer financial transactions and direct distribution of their fresh agricultural produce via marketing cooperatives. Moreover, the study showed that there is a statistically significant difference in the motives of participation in a marketing cooperative that has bargaining power and direct distribution of fresh agricultural produce between the three categories of education level. However, producers appeared to agree that (1) the great divergence in members' reasons for participation in a marketing cooperative and (2) the inability to take collective decisions by the general assembly are the most important disincentives for participation in marketing cooperatives.","[Batzios, Aristotelis; Sergaki, Panagiota] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Kontogeorgos, Achilleas] Int Hellen Univ, Dept Agr, Thessaloniki 57400, Greece; [Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios] Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Reg & Cross Border Dev, Kozani 50100, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; International Hellenic University; University of Western Macedonia,"Batzios, A (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",a1990batzios@gmail.com; akontoge@ihu.gr; fxtheodoridis@uowm.gr; gsergaki@agro.auth.gr,"Sergaki, Panagiota/AAN-8706-2021; Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/E-3450-2017","Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/0000-0003-2008-1023; SERGAKI, PANAGIOTA/0000-0003-1717-7091",,,,,56,5,5,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,1676,10.3390/su13041676,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13041676,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ8ON,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000624779000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

I test the effectiveness of social movement theories in explaining this phenomenon by examining frequency and intensity of protest from 1980-1995. I find that grievance models have little explanatory power, political opportunity accounts for the frequency of protest, and resource mobilization offers insight into both frequency and intensity of protests. Supplementing existing theories, I offer qualitative evidence that development programs designed to restructure agricultural cooperatives created mobilizing structures. The reforms were intended to help family farmers adapt to the new market economy, but because most protests targeted liberalization policies, I conclude that in their short-term success, development agencies inadvertently subsidized the cost of collection action against their long-term goals.","Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Valdez, S (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, 211 Savery Hall,Box 353340, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",sarahv@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,48,4,5,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

It has now been recognized that producer cooperatives might possess paradoxical potentials of promoting egalitarian economy and democratic management whilst at the same time constructing class hierarchies. So far, agrarian scholars have already identified how pre-existing social differentiation facilitated privileged members to exploit the marginal non-members. However, they have not explored how members exercise their agency in challenging the class division. In summer 2013, at the height of China's cooperatization movement, I embarked on a project of engaged anthropology to mobilize shrimp farmers in South China to establish a cooperative so as to challenge agribusinesses that squeeze farmers' returns, but members ended up hiring outside labour. However, members tried hard to bridge the hierarchy between investors and workers as well as between managers and labourers in order to expand its membership and build the village's reputation. This paper traces how cooperative members deal with the dilemmas between profit maximization and egalitarian distribution, highlighting the importance of class analysis for a pro-poor cooperative movement.","[Huang, Yu] Minzu Univ China, Sch Ethnol & Sociol, 27 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Huang, Y (corresponding author), Minzu Univ China, Sch Ethnol & Sociol, 27 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",huangyu@muc.edu.cn,,"Huang, Yu/0000-0003-4378-387X",Minzu University of China; Wenner-Gren Foundation,Minzu University of China; Wenner-Gren Foundation,Minzu University of China; The Wenner-Gren Foundation,,68,0,0,10,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Our analysis focuses on four Moroccan milk collection cooperatives that started using a milk analyzer with the aim of eliminating cheating by their suppliers. The cooperatives' room for maneuver in improving quality management was limited by the presence of competitors for milk collection and by the agro-industry's lack of transparency in the way its own quality controls were applied.

The analysis focusses on the dimensions of economic control, voice and agency, and shows that co-operatives can promote inclusion. However, co-operatives are inevitably influenced by the wider context in which they are constituted and are therefore part of an ongoing, and often contradictory, process of change.

In this paper, we highlight that a cooperative is an enterprise owned by a network of entrepreneurial members. By taking explicitly into account the social interactions among entrepreneurial members and the impact of social ties on members' product quality provisions, we identify the circumstances when pooling is efficient. It is shown that social interactions mitigate the free-riding effect of pooling and that the amount of members' social interactions depends upon, and increases with, the cooperative's pooling ratio. We show that the complete pooling policy is not only economically efficient but also socially advantageous when the context of the cooperative is conducive to frequent social interactions among members.","[Deng, Wendong] NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Archimedesstr 17, NL-4816 BA Breda, Netherlands; [Hendrikse, George] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Mandeville Bldg T10-56,Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Breda University of Applied Sciences; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Deng, WD (corresponding author), NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Archimedesstr 17, NL-4816 BA Breda, Netherlands.",deng.w@nhtv.nl; ghendrikse@rsm.nl,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Factors inhibiting early-stage rural cooperative growth and survival encompass various aspects of negative and antithetical social capital, exacerbated by management and marketing weaknesses, as well as regional and national institutional conditions.

This paper establishes a typology of cooperative exporters based on a sample of 45 Spanish citrus cooperatives and analyses the existence of significant differences between them based on their knowledge of markets, market orientation and innovation. The results show that there are differences in knowledge of markets among those cooperatives that export through second grade cooperatives and those who export directly.

In addition, we discuss ICT channel creation for improving knowledge, awareness, democracy, and the participation of members, a process in which IT contributes to the accessibility of members and communication between the co-operative, members, and stakeholders. The element design of this proposed framework has considered three key principles, which are (1) smart members, (2) the smart economy, and (3) smart governance. A smart co-operative is a term used to extend the concept of a smart city into co-operative organization to promote a sustainable development approach in the co-operative sector. Therefore, the smart co-operative combines ICT, smart concepts, co-operative business aspects, business models, and innovation. The findings suggest that the smart and sustainable development co-operative framework is suitable for co-operatives, providing a comprehensive framework for value creation through the smart co-operative concept.","[Chawviang, Anassaya; Kiattisin, Supaporn] Mahidol Univ, Fac Engn, Informat Technol Management, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand",Mahidol University,"Kiattisin, S (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Engn, Informat Technol Management, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.",anassaya.cha@student.mahidol.ac.th; supaporn.kit@mahidol.ac.th,,"kiattisin, supaporn/0000-0002-7776-643X",Agricultural Research Development Agency (Public Organization),Agricultural Research Development Agency (Public Organization),This research was funded by the Agricultural Research Development Agency (Public Organization).

Three categories of member attributes are identified: satisfaction with the profitability of farm operations, age of the member, and experience from board work. The cooperatives' degree of success is measured as members' commitment towards cooperatives, and members' trust in the board of directors. The data originate from a mail Survey among 2,250 Swedish farmers. The results indicate differences in members' commitment and their trust towards directors to be due to farm profitability, the members' age and experience as directors. After adding members' perception of their participation in the governance as a covariate, most of the other differences are explained by this variable. Age is still partly associated with trust towards directors; older farmers have less trust. [EconLit Classifications: Q13, D23, D72].

The objective was to implement certain rapeseed cultivation operations that had shown their efficiency in previous studies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: (i) the use of decision support systems (DSS) to calculate nitrogen fertilisation rates, (ii) the cultivation of legumes as intercrops with rapeseed or (iii) as previous crops. This paper first presents an estimate of the potential GHG effects of these cultivation operations, using results from previous studies obtained under experimental conditions or using crop modelling. It then presents the level of adoption by farmers of these cultivation operations in the context of the Demarche de progres DIESTER (R) initiative to continuously improve the environmental performance of rapeseed biodiesel. Depending on the year, 39 to 74 agricultural cooperatives and grain trading companies were involved in the study, and 90 170 to 283 480 hectares of rapeseed have been monitored. This is the first time in France that an attempt to improve cultivation operations for environmental reasons has been made on such a scale. The average GHG reduction values, compared to fossil fuels, varied from 49.5 to 55.8% depending on the year, which was most often above the 50% minimum reduction value for sustainable biodiesel, but well below the 70% minimum for very low GHG emission biodiesel. Using the results of previous studies, this article shows that the widespread use of decision support systems to calculate mineral N fertilizer rates, and the cultivation of legumes as a preceding crop or intercrop, would make it possible to significantly reduce GHGs and make it possible to produce very low GHG-emitting biodiesel in certain locations and/or years. However, the actual changes in cultural operations were too small to be effective. The reasons for this lack of impact and how to achieve results in the future are discussed in this article.","[Flenet, Francis; Wagner, Dominique; Simonin, Pascal] Terres Inovia, Ave Lucien Bretignieres, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",,"Flénet, F (corresponding author), Terres Inovia, Ave Lucien Bretignieres, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",f.flenet@terresinovia.fr,,,SAIPOL; AVRIL group,SAIPOL; AVRIL group,The authors wish to thank SAIPOL and AVRIL group for the financial support and for the coordination of this study.,,15,3,3,2,4,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",2272-6977,2257-6614,,OCL OILS FAT CROP LI,OCL Oilseed.Fats Crops Lipids,DEC 18,2020,27,,,,,,,,69,10.1051/ocl/2020068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/ocl/2020068,,,7,Agronomy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,PI8AW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000601308000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a result of privatisation a lot of firms had been changing their legal form. Before 1989 in agriculture cooperatives were the usual legal form. Nowadays Joint Stock Company and Limited Liability Companies dominate. This paper examines the impact of legal form of agricultural farms on agency costs for a panel of Slovak agricultural farms. We assume that the legal form of a farm determinates the level of the agency costs. There were three measures used: the ratio of operational expanses to annual sales, sales-to-total assets ratio and return on equity. Using MANCOVA and ANCOVA techniques, we find that the legal form of a farm is a relevant determinant of agency costs level. We also conclude that the use of operational expanses to annual sales ratio is recommended only in industries in which its mean value in long run is lower than 1.","[Toth, Marian; Piterkova, Andrea] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Munk, Michal] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Informat, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Tóth, M (corresponding author), Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",marian.toth@uniag.sk; mmunk@ukf.sk; radovan.savov@uniag.sk; xpiterkovaa@uniag.sk,"Munk, Michal/AAE-7199-2020; Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019; Toth, Marian/H-4857-2016; Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Munk, Michal/N-1724-2017","Munk, Michal/0000-0002-9913-3596",,,,,20,2,2,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,471,478,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000373210600054,View Full Record in Web of Science

The problem involves multiple crops, multiple smallholder farmers, and multiple periods. The current planning is performed manually and results in haphazard amounts of revenue per farmer. A priority-based max-min heuristic (PMMH) is proposed to solve this problem. A social objective of the PMMH is to minimise the standard deviation of the revenue per greenhouse. The proposed heuristic reduces this standard deviation in the solution by reallocating crops among the greenhouses of the farmers, especially those farmers with very high or very low revenues. The PMMH is tested on various problem scenarios. The solutions obtained with the PMMH provide better objective function values than those from What's Best solver. The results also show that the revenue per greenhouse is affected by the number of greenhouses per farmer.","[Pakawanich, Peerapong; Udomsakdigool, Apinanthana; Khompatraporn, Charoenchai] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Fac Engn, Dept Prod Engn, Bangkok, Thailand; [Khompatraporn, Charoenchai] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Grad Sch Management & Innovat, Bangkok, Thailand",King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi,"Khompatraporn, C (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand.",charoenchai.kho@kmutt.ac.th,"Khompatraporn, Charoenchai/AFX-9402-2022","Khompatraporn, Charoenchai/0000-0002-0828-5798",KMUTT Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship [3/2558],KMUTT Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship,This research has been supported by the KMUTT Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship (3/2558).,,25,1,1,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-5682,1476-9360,,J OPER RES SOC,J.

The defining feature is that the existing agricultural cooperation in Ukraine is not backed up by proper legislation to integrate with the European countries. Analyzing the state of agricultural cooperation in Ukraine in comparison with foreign countries, the country remains a number of unresolved issues regarding its normal functioning, namely: the activation of international economic cooperation of Ukraine involving the development of a strategy for the effective functioning of agricultural cooperation, which is the basis for ensuring the various areas of rural development employment of rural population. In addition, agricultural cooperation stimulates the development of agrarian market infrastructure, plays an exceptional role in strengthening the economic potential, competitiveness and social status of agricultural producers, improving economic conditions and creating incentives for the growth of commodity products. However, so far its development is at a low level, the main reasons being the underestimation in the process of economic reforms of cooperative forms of economic activity, general unfavorable conditions for agricultural production, psychological unwillingness of peasants to cooperate and insufficient knowledge of the rural population about the benefits of cooperation, weak state support for small businesses in agribusiness and agricultural cooperatives. Methods. The countries of the West in every way stimulate the development of cooperation: by appropriate laws, privileges, subsidies. Ukraine needs to take the example from these countries in order to develop the cooperative movement, which will stimulate rural development. Results. Ukraine is trying to build on the experience of different countries in the field of agricultural cooperation, backing up on the best of the countries studied. Practical implications. Studies have shown that world experience convinces that cooperation has contributed to the development of many countries in the world. In Europe, for example, cooperatives are an important part of economic life and industry. Value/originality. Analyzing the activities of agricultural cooperatives operating in the world, we point out that the main advantage of combining agricultural producers in cooperatives is a grower group (union or cooperative) is considered as the only powerful organization that is able to buy large volumes of products and services and realize large volumes of production.","[Sakovska, Olena] Uman Natl Univ Hort, Uman, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Uman National University of Horticulture,"Sakovska, O (corresponding author), Uman Natl Univ Hort, Uman, Ukraine.",sakovska_lena@ukr.net,"Sakovska, Olena/AAD-7646-2019","Sakovska, Olena/0000-0003-2676-6170",,,,,16,4,4,1,12,BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES,RIGA,"VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA",2256-0742,2256-0963,,BALT J ECON STUD,Balt.

The statistical analysis uses nationally representative data for 8350 randomly-selected households interviewed during 2004/05 for the second Malawi Integrated Household Survey. Regressions are estimated separately for households in the north, centre, and south of Malawi to account for spatial heterogeneity. Results of a multilevel logit model reveal that households are less likely to be food insecure if they have larger cultivated land per capita, receive agricultural field assistance, reside in a community with an agricultural cooperative and relatively high annual rainfall, and are headed by an individual with a high school degree. Factors that positively correlate with household food insecurity are price of maize, price of fertiliser, number of household members, and distance to markets. Implications of these findings for policy are discussed.","[Fisher, Monica] Ethiopia Off, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Lewin, Paul A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Fisher, M (corresponding author), Ethiopia Off, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, C-O ILRI Sholla Campus,POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",m.fisher@cgiar.org,"Lewin, Paul A/H-5610-2012; Lewin, Paul A/F-5872-2017","Lewin, Paul A/0000-0002-2343-7059; Lewin, Paul A/0000-0002-2343-7059; Fisher, Monica/0000-0002-6669-6261",,,,,35,16,16,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0376-835X,1470-3637,,DEV SO AFR,Dev.

Other indicative findings on participatory employee ownership firms outperforming conventional participatory firms lead us to hypothesize whether employee ownership and participatory decision-making may have a synergistic performance effect. A longitudinal approach mainly suggests that employee ownership firms perform worse than conventional firms before the inception of an employee ownership programme, but better afterwards. The findings are discussed in relation to economic theories on profit sharing and on participatory and labour-managed firms.","UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH BUSINESS,SEATTLE,WA 98195",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Winther, G (corresponding author), UNIV AALBORG,DEPT DEV & PLANNING,AALBORG,DENMARK.",,,,,,,,58,17,17,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"6 BONHILL STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND EC2A 4PU",0143-831X,,,ECON IND DEMOCRACY,Econ.

The adoption of its regulations is uneven, with most regulations followed except the one-person, one-vote rule. We model investment decisions of Chinese cooperatives and measure the efficiency of capital allocation under heterogeneous membership and alternative governance policies. We show that relative membership heterogeneity in equity and patronage holdings and a cooperative's dividend policy are crucial in determining the optimal level of governance centralization. Centralizing the governance to major equity holders and following other regulations reflect a trade-off faced by cooperatives between obtaining financial support from the government and achieving efficient decision-making.","[Ma Meilin] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Zhu Heng] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ma, ML (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",mameilin@purdue.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273267],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are grateful to Samuel Bird, Michael Carter, James Chalfant, Rachael Goodhue, Sherman Hardesty, Alexander McCalla, and Kevin Novan for sharing their ideas on this research.

We use predictive analytics to forecast U.S. farmer cooperative sustainability at an aggregate level and include multiple dimensions of membership heterogeneity. We report the importance and shape of the effect of membership heterogeneity when predicting and forecasting cooperative sustainability in the near-term. We also report forecasts of cooperative sustainability given expected changes to membership heterogeneity. The data this study used are from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Economic Research Service (ERS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) joined with USDA-Rural Development cooperative financial data at the state level. Membership heterogeneity was found to be less relevant than other variables included in the model for predicting cooperative business volume and number of cooperatives headquartered per state, and an estimate of cooperative sustainability. Membership heterogeneity effects were mostly offsetting given expected changes to member heterogeneity, and/or were offset due to changes to other macro factors. Consequently, we conclude membership heterogeneity may affect the number of cooperatives and extent consistent with theoretical literature at a micro level; however, we also expect a similar level of sustainability of cooperatives at an aggregate level in the near-term despite changes to membership heterogeneity.","[Elliott, Matthew; Elliott, Lisa; Van der Sluis, Evert] South Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Box 2236,1150 Campanile Ave, Brookings, SD 57007 USA",South Dakota State University,"Elliott, M (corresponding author), South Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Box 2236,1150 Campanile Ave, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",matthew.elliott@sdstate.edu; lisa.elliott@sdstate.edu; Evert.VanDerSluis@sdstate.edu,,,"South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station at South Dakota State University; Hatch project from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1006890]; NIFA [1006890, 812817] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station at South Dakota State University; Hatch project from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),We gratefully acknowledge that this project was supported by the South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station at South Dakota State University and by Hatch project accession No. 1006890 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.,,41,6,6,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2018,10,6,,,,,,,2048,10.3390/su10062048,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10062048,,,31,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GK9LE,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000436570100360,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditionally there has been a problem of organization among farmers mainly due to the reluctance to pool decisional and property rights on input and/or output. Following the Transaction Costs Economics framework, the paper aims to investigate which are the main drivers of the collective forms of organization in the Italian agro-food system, paying particular attention to transaction costs' attributes and to the increasing role played by the institutional environment as well. The choice to join a cooperative or producer organization is therefore conceptualized as a governance structure choice.

The methods used were historical-logical, systemic and hypothetical-deductive and, as empirical, observation. The procedures used were analysis and synthesis, scientific abstraction, induction-deduction and individual and group interview techniques, with a predominance of documentary analysis and research, and participatory action. It is concluded that the foundations of cooperativism have turned this movement into a key factor of development, which contributes in a decisive way to food sovereignty, so the synergy between both aspects will allow to make it concrete and to project actions in pursuit of a nutritional education that leads to a healthy life. The contributions of the cooperative sector to the management of local food systems and municipal development strategies as tools that help to food sovereignty and nutritional education are needed.","[Labrador Machin, Odalys] Univ Pinar del Rio Hermanos Saiz Montes de Oca, Dept Preparac & Superac Cuadros, Pinar Del Rio, Cuba; [Mirabal Gonzalez, Yamira; Torres Paez, Carlos Cesar] Univ Pinar del Rio Hermanos Saiz Montes de Oca, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Ctr Estudios Direcc Desarrollo Local Turismo & Co, Pinar Del Rio, Cuba",,"Machín, OL (corresponding author), Univ Pinar del Rio Hermanos Saiz Montes de Oca, Dept Preparac & Superac Cuadros, Pinar Del Rio, Cuba.",odalys@upr.edu.cu; yamira@upr.edu.cu; carlosc@upr.edu.cu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,UNIV PINAR RIO HERMANOS SAIZ MONTES OCA,PINA DEL RIO,"CALLE MARTI NO 300 27 NOVIEMBRE & GONZALEZ ALCORTA, PINA DEL RIO, CP 20100, CUBA",2310-340X,,,REV COOP DESARRO-COO,Rev.

Trust fosters cooperation in many economic and social interactions and is important to the success of traditional agricultural cooperatives. Little is known about how trust affects farmers' willingness to cooperate to provide an ecosystem service, what types of trust are most important, and under what conditions trust may matter. In this study, we present results of a survey of Missouri crop farmers exploring the role trust plays in farmers' stated willingness to cooperate to control pests. We find that most farmers say they are willing to cooperate, and most farmers are willing to trust others. However, we find little evidence that trust positively influences farmers' willingness to cooperate to control pests. Instead, we find that trust may only matter under certain conditions, such as when participants' farms are dissimilar, and that other determinants, such as the perceived benefit of cooperation and environmental concern, are more important than trust to farmers who are contemplating cooperation to control pests.","[Stallman, Heidi R.; James, Harvey S., Jr.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Stallman, HR (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",hrs220@mail.missouri.edu; hjames@missouri.edu,"James, Harvey/V-4021-2019","James, Harvey/0000-0003-0189-271X; Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,58,16,16,3,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

These entities played a key role in the institutional architecture of the apartheid regime, ensuring the domination of white commercial farmers over the sector. Within the framework of the deregulation of the economy and the agricultural sector, such entities faced transformations of modern capitalism, especially the growing power of financial actors and markets. Although white commercial farmers still largely retain these inherited structures, these companies are presently being targeted more and more by private takeovers and/or private equity deals. Based on two specific empirical examples of private equity deals affecting South African grain cooperatives, this paper describes this financialization process in practice, in particular by analysing the interaction between financial and agricultural actors and the alliances on the ground that determine its success. In doing so, it details the different trajectories of these (former) cooperatives, highlighting the resilience, mutation, and extinction of commercial agriculture in South Africa.","[Ducastel, Antoine] CIRAD UMR ART Dev, TA C-113-15,73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Anseeuw, Ward] CIRAD UMR ART Dev & Int Land Coalit, Via Paolo di Dono 44, Rome, Italy",CIRAD; CIRAD,"Ducastel, A (corresponding author), CIRAD UMR ART Dev, TA C-113-15,73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",antoine.ducastel@cirad.fr,,"Ducastel, Antoine/0000-0001-6343-5173",,,,,47,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In this paper, we discuss and challenge the depoliticization of cooperatives based on research into how two Paraguayan cooperatives dealt with the aftermath of a debt forgiveness law for small farmers. The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities. To conclude, we discuss the advantages and challenges of politicizing cooperatives and offer reflections on how these challenges might be overcome.","[Burke, Brian J.] Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Piekielek, Jessica] So Oregon Univ, Ashland, OR USA",University of Arizona; Southern Oregon University,"Burke, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",bburke@email.arizona.edu; piekielj@sou.edu,,"Burke, Brian/0000-0002-0550-6364",,,,,53,3,3,1,15,SOC APPLIED ANTHROPOLOGY,OKLAHOMA CITY,"3000 UNITED FOUNDERS BLVD, STE 148, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73112 USA",0018-7259,1938-3525,,HUM ORGAN,Hum.

We apply this framework to two case studies: an open-air market promoting short food supply chains in France, and a partnership between an agricultural cooperative and several solidarity purchase groups (GAS) in Italy. Analysing the trajectories of the two initiatives, we highlight the processes through which new economic models are jointly built via interactions between different actors.

Land inequality was serious in the region under the Republic of Vietnam's regime. The new government struggled with agricultural collectivisation contributing to the decline in rice productivity. This study explains the persistence of a market-based agricultural production in the southern economy under the new political regime. Beside the economic reasons and arguments of local peasants' everyday politics cited in the literature, we argue that the de facto political power of the middle-class landowners was an important factor impeding the performance of agricultural cooperatives. It also implies that agricultural productivity was more vital than land inequality during the study period. We apply the model of Acemoglu and Robinson explaining how de facto political power helps elites to maintain their economic institutions in spite of a political change.","[Bui, Minh-Tam T.] Srinakharinwirot Univ, Sch Econ & Publ Policy, 114 Soi Sukhumvit 23, Bangkok 10110, Thailand; [Preechametta, Arayah] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",Srinakharinwirot University; Thammasat University,"Bui, MTT (corresponding author), Srinakharinwirot Univ, Sch Econ & Publ Policy, 114 Soi Sukhumvit 23, Bangkok 10110, Thailand.",buithiminh@swu.ac.th,"Bui, MinhTam/U-2468-2019; BUI, MinhTam/GRR-7131-2022","BUI, MinhTam/0000-0002-4959-9507",Thailand Research Fund,Thailand Research Fund(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)),"The authors are grateful for the financial support from the Thailand Research Fund.

One of which is that the problems and strategies must be the target of managers and authorities in a sustainable common project of development to the benefit of the whole dairy supply chain.","[Beber, Caetano Luiz; Carpio, Andres Fabricio Ruales; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ, Chair Econ Agribusiness, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Goettingen Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Almadani, Mohamad Isam] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Farm Econ, Bundesallee 63, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",University of Gottingen; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Beber, CL (corresponding author), Georg August Univ, Chair Econ Agribusiness, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Goettingen Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cbeber@uni-goettingen.de,"Beber, Caetano Luiz/AGH-3629-2022; Beber, Caetano Luiz/JFS-7444-2023; Beber, Caetano Luiz/AAK-8402-2020","Beber, Caetano Luiz/0000-0002-5036-4932; Beber, Caetano Luiz/0000-0002-5036-4932; Almadani, Mohamad Isam/0000-0002-5706-7922",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This work was supported by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES).,,64,14,15,0,20,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to place the discussion on aid effectiveness within a multilevel governance perspective, going beyond country assessments. Secondly, to evaluate the Paris principles in terms of dynamic processes rather than simply outcomes, thus entailing the need for systemic evaluations, also through participatory methods. The Ethio-Italian cooperation project Agricultural Value Chains in Oromia'' is analysed as a case study, assessing its coherence with the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness by involving stakeholders at different levels. Overall, the project's focus on transformative quality-oriented value chain processes is proved to substantially shape dynamic multi-stakeholder interactions in enhancing Paris principles at local, national and international levels.","[Biggeri, Mario; Ciani, Federico] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, FI, Italy; [Ciani, Federico; Ferrannini, Andrea] PIN Scrl, ARCO Lab Act Res COdev, Polo Univ Citta Prato,Piazza Ciardi 25, I-59100 Prato, PO, Italy",University of Florence,"Ferrannini, A (corresponding author), PIN Scrl, ARCO Lab Act Res COdev, Polo Univ Citta Prato,Piazza Ciardi 25, I-59100 Prato, PO, Italy.",mario.biggeri@unifi.it; federico.ciani@unifi.it; andrea.ferrannini@arcolab.org,"Ciani, Federico/HJA-2460-2022","BIGGERI, MARIO/0000-0001-7986-380X",,,,,47,4,4,2,25,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0957-8811,1743-9728,,EUR J DEV RES,Eur.

This study uses in-depth interviews, fieldwork, and secondary sources to contextualize EPEC within the county's stories about place-within its heritage narratives. The dominant heritage narrative (depicting Lake County's character as agriculturalist, cooperative and harmonious, and antiregulatory) is shown to be a major factor shaping and justifying the creation and operation of EPEC. Despite the existence of counternarratives, the dominant heritage narrative prefigured the emergence of EPEC and helped reinforce EPEC as the county's way of handling the growth of grape growing in the region and the resulting erosion problem. This article argues for greater attention to the role of community narratives about place in understanding how decisions are made on environmental and land-use issues.","Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Alkon, AH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ahalkon@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,42,35,35,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1086-0266,,,ORGAN ENVIRON,Organ.

The analysis finds a positive effect of voluntary participation on personal social capital. However, once we consider the degree of participation by classifying participants into nominal and active participants, status changes from nonparticipants to nominal participants nurture personal social capital, but status changes from nominal to active participants fail to enhance personal social capital. Our findings suggest that increasing the level of participation does not necessarily contribute to social capital development in a linear way because active participation may bring about not just positive features-such as frequent interactions with others or experiences of successful collaboration-but also conflict among community members.","[Hulugalla, Niranjala] State Minist Home Affairs, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Yamada, Kyohei] Int Univ Japan, Grad Sch Int Relat, Minamiuonuma, Japan; [Kakinaka, Makoto] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan",Hiroshima University,"Kakinaka, M (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan.",kakinaka@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Kakinaka, Makoto/O-2150-2015","Kakinaka, Makoto/0000-0003-2349-1976; Yamada, Kyohei/0000-0003-0800-069X",,,,,82,1,1,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0954-1748,1099-1328,,J INT DEV,J.

The government also seeks to promote agricultural exports and farmers' participation in processing and distributing agricultural products. Led by the Prime Minister's Office, and taking advantage of changes in the political environment of agriculture that have weakened the political power of farmers and JA, the government has launched a reform offensive with variable impact: progress has been made in some areas (e.g. JA reform) but little change in others (such as rice production adjustment).

The fixed effects are found to be significant and important, but can be only partly explained by observed cooperative attributes. This provides another support to the Monte Carlo results of Borjas and Sueyoshi, that controlling for group effects is superior to alternative models.

This paper distinguishes production uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty in examining four kinds of business relationships of Chinese vegetable farmers: market exchange, cooperative membership without marketing transaction, cooperative membership with marketing transaction, and contract farming. We applied a multinomial logit model to data collected among 413 farmers in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. The results suggested that all three types of uncertainty significantly affect the business relationships chosen by vegetable farmers. In particular, it was found that as production uncertainty increases, farmers prefer contract farming and both cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction over market exchange; while as behavioral uncertainty increases, farmers are less likely to be involved in contract farming. Environmental uncertainty does not affect the likelihood that farmers choose market exchange or contract farming, while mixed results are obtained for its effects on cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction.

Many questions have arisen in recent decades in relation to the environmental impacts caused by agricultural activities. But the matter cannot be reduced to discussions, often dogmatic and sterile, opposing agriculture to the environment. To contribute to a better understanding of this problem, this study aims to examine the role of agricultural cooperatives in the dissemination of sustainable agricultural practices among its members. The data collection method involved interviews with managers of cooperatives and producer groups, direct observation on the field, and when possible and relevant, literature reviews. It is concluded that cooperatives have promoted actions to increase producers' access to more sustainable agricultural practices, but, however, they still face difficulties in disseminating these practices among its members.","[Leite, Antonio Edson] Fac Sudoeste Paulista, Adm Empresas, Avare, SP, Brazil; [Leite, Antonio Edson] Univ Estadual Paulista, Engn Prod, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Leite, Antonio Edson] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, UFSCAR, Engn Prod, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Leite, Antonio Edson] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Prod Engn, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Batalha, Mario Otavio] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Engn Quim, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Batalha, Mario Otavio] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Engn Prod, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Batalha, Mario Otavio] Inst Natl Polytech Lorraine, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Batalha, Mario Otavio] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universite de Lorraine; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,"Leite, AE (corresponding author), Fac Sudoeste Paulista, Adm Empresas, Avare, SP, Brazil.;Leite, AE (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Engn Prod, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.;Leite, AE (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, UFSCAR, Engn Prod, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;Leite, AE (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Prod Engn, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",antonio.edson.leite@gmail.com; dmob@ufscar.br,"Batalha, Mario O/J-9302-2012","Batalha, Mario Otavio/0000-0003-2711-3358",,,,,44,0,0,1,37,INTERCIENCIA,CARACAS,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,OCT,2016,41,10,,,,,660,667,,,,,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ9HV,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000386186800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building on Galbraith's insight that corporations cause subtle but pervasive societal imbalances, the paper locates the role of nonprofit organizations in compensating for these imbalances, thus showing corporations and nonprofit organizations to be mutually complementary rather than antagonistic actors. This argument is supported by Niklas Luhmann's vision of the precarious relationship between the complexity and sustainability of social systems as well as by Kenneth Boulding's analysis of the farmer and labor movement. Luhmann's and Boulding's perspectives show profit-seeking corporations to be social systems developing high technological complexity at the cost of sacrificing their societal sustainability, while the improvement of the latter constitutes the rationale of many nonprofit organizations. The same systems-theoretic logic suggests, however, that nonprofit organizations may tend to underestimate the technological complexity of implementing their mission-related activities, thereby undermining their own effectiveness.

We examine the role of producer organizations (POs) in influencing safe food production behaviours among farmers. Using data from 11 expert interviews and a quantitative survey involving 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya, a propensity score matching estimation is employed to assess membership effects. We show that membership in POs positively and significantly influences smallholders' adoption of food safety measures related to milk storage and the milking area. We highlight the importance of social incentives in improving food safety adoption among farmers even when price incentives are absent. Our recommendation is that PO policies that alleviate barriers to food safety adoption among farmers will be helpful in scaling up adoption.","[Mwambi, Mercy; Bijman, Jos] Wageningen Univ & Res, Business Management & Org Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Mshenga, Patience] Egerton Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness Management, POB 536, Egerton 20115, Kenya; [Oosting, Simon] Wageningen Univ & Res, Anim Prod Syst Grp, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Egerton University; Wageningen University & Research,"Bijman, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Business Management & Org Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",jos.bijman@wur.nl,,"Oosting, Simon/0000-0003-2080-1879; Mwambi, Mercy/0000-0002-6403-6032",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development (NWO-WOTRO) [W.08.205.204],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development (NWO-WOTRO),"Financial support was provided by Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development (NWO-WOTRO) through a project called `Local and International business collaboration for inclusiveness and Quality Improvement in Dairy chains in Southeast Asia and East Africa (LIQUID)' (Grant number: W.08.205.204).

However, many cooperatives are threatened by the risk of abandonment of members' cropland, which reduces their sourcing capacity. In this context, joint cropland management initiatives have become a useful form of social and organizational innovation. This research's contribution is twofold: it examines the relevance of some drivers of this organizational innovation, and it determines the cooperative characteristics or combinations of characteristics that can sufficiently explain the adoption of a joint cropland management strategy. Some cooperatives' features have been a priori identified as related to the achievement of joint cropland initiatives: economic size, social innovation, innovative behavior, and collaborative orientation. The study is mainly based on data from a cooperatives survey, and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) methodology has been used. The analysis has been completed by surveying cooperatives' managers about their opinions on a joint cropland management strategy's main advantages and drivers. Results indicate that social and economic innovation, size, and propensity to cooperate with other cooperatives are key factors that help create a cooperative profile capable of tackling the challenge of land abandonment and the consequent loss of production.","[Veronica, Pineiro] Univ Nacl Sur UNS, Dept Agron, San Andres 800, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Veronica, Pineiro; Victor, Martinez-Gomez; Jose-Maria, Garcia-Alvarez-Coque] Univ Politecn Valencia, Grp Int Econ & Dev, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Elena, Melia-Marti] Univ Politecn Valencia, CEGEA, Ctr Invest Gest Empresas, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",National University of the South; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Veronica, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Sur UNS, Dept Agron, San Andres 800, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Veronica, P (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Grp Int Econ & Dev, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",veronica.pineiro@uns.edu.ar; vicmargo@esp.upv.es; emeliam@esp.upv.es; jmgarcia@upvnet.upv.es,"Pineiro, Veronica/S-8587-2018; Garcia-Alvarez-Coque, Jose-Maria/G-9964-2015; Melia-Marti, Elena/K-5154-2016","Pineiro, Veronica/0000-0003-3658-969X; Garcia-Alvarez-Coque, Jose-Maria/0000-0002-4334-7843; Melia-Marti, Elena/0000-0002-0417-2139","Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain; European Regional Development Fund; European Commission [RTI2018-093791-B-C22]","Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain, European Regional Development Fund, European Commission.

Consequently, as ownership is dispersed and control is delegated, members may face increasing agency cost. In spite of the potential to impact performance and even survival, empirical attention to agency problems in farm producer organizations is limited. The purpose of this paper is to address the gap in the literature with an empirical study. Design/methodology/approach With survey responses from 365 farm producer organizations in the USA, the author uses a two-limit tobit model to estimate the relationships of six ownership and governance characteristics (i.e. board size, management size, director independence, manager independence, CEO independence and non-member ownership) to agency cost, which is proxied by the operating expense ratio. Findings While controlling for heterogeneity in scale and technology, the author finds positive relationships of board size, management size and CEO independence to agency cost. The novel result illustrates there is a significant cost to the adoption of non-traditional ownership and governance characteristics by farm producer organizations. Originality/value Agency cost is rarely studied in relation to farm producer organizations. Recent contributions in the empirical literature lacked an explicit connection of ownership and governance characteristics to agency cost.","[Grashuis, Jasper] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Grashuis, J (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grashuisj@missouri.edu,,"Grashuis, Jasper/0000-0002-5075-4439",,,,,37,4,4,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

As compared to the traditional cooperative, the NGC facilitates a strong market orientation by defining membership and requiring high supply and equity capital commitments. Approximately 100 such value-added ventures formed during a period called 'cooperative fever', but public and producer interest dissipated in the 2000s. With secondary data collected from print media publications, we conclude that many of the original NGCs exited by means of bankruptcy or liquidation because of challenges common to most business organizations. However, other failures and conversions of large, successful NGCs also indicate an inherent equity and liquidity constraint, suggesting a limited ability of the organizational form to drive complex and capital-intensive value-added ventures. We conclude by raising possible conditions for the future viability of producer-owned business organizations in the value-added agri-food industry.","[Grashuis, Jasper; Cook, Michael] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Cook, M (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",GrashuisJ@missouri.edu; CookML@missouri.edu,,,,,,,99,12,15,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

However, few studies have focused on tackling the effects of EA in relation with the concept of rural prosperity. This article analyzes, from a learning process of over 40 years of experience of an Agricultural Transformation Company (ATC), the relationship between EA and its influence on rural prosperity. The methodology applied is based on the Working With People (WWP) model, integrating the expert knowledge experimented through SAT's actions. The experience is centered on one of Spain's regions with the greatest crop surface dedicated to EA. Results show the effects that EA has on different dimensions of rural prosperity. The creation of trust and working with people are the main premises that help bring about rural prosperity and development with a vision of sustainability.","[De Los Rios-Carmenado, Ignacio; Rivera, Maria] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ave Puerta de Hierro 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Becerril-Hernandez, Hilario] Colegio Postgrad, Campus Tabasco,Km 3-5, Cardenas 86570, Tabasco, Mexico",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico,"De Los Rios-Carmenado, I (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Ave Puerta de Hierro 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",Ignacio.delosrios@upm.es; hbecerri@colpos.mx,"DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/HGD-4203-2022; Rivera, Maria/GYU-2150-2022; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/AAR-5700-2020; Rivera, María/AAF-1530-2020","DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2015-8983; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2015-8983; Rivera, María/0000-0003-0642-0818",,,,,43,6,9,1,7,COLEGIO POSTGRADUADOS,MONTECILLO,"CARRETERA MEXICO TEXCOCO KM 36 5, MONTECILLO 56230, ESTADO MEXICO, MEXICO",1405-3195,,,AGROCIENCIA-MEXICO,Agrociencia,APR-MAY,2016,50,3,,,,,375,389,,,,,,19,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,DL8JW,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000375889300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The risk sharing and benefit distribution mechanisms are important governance arrangements that affect cooperation longevity in member-heterogeneous cooperatives. However, the relationship between cooperatives' risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangements and cooperation longevity is not well understood. To address this research gap, we provide a conceptual framework to illustrate the relationship between risk sharing, benefit distribution, contract form and cooperation longevity. By conducting 23 interviews with three dairy cooperatives in China using a multiple-case-study method, we find that cooperation longevity is influenced by the alignment of the combination of risk sharing and benefit distribution for cooperatives and their members. Following the principles of risk-benefit equivalence and strategy-risk preference matching, we discuss four scenarios of match or mismatch of combinations of risk sharing and benefit distribution. We suggest that the government needs to strengthen risk mitigation capabilities for cooperatives and members, and to help them to build an effective risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangement to achieve sustainable development.","[Zhong, Zhen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jia, Fu] Univ York, York Management Sch, Heslington, England; [Long, Wenjin] China Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kevin Z.] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kevin Z.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, East & Cent Asia Off, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; University of York - UK; China Agricultural University; Zhejiang University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Jia, F (corresponding author), Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",fu.jia@york.ac.uk,"Long, Wenjin/AAU-1221-2020","Long, Wenjin/0000-0003-1419-2544; Kaiser, Gail/0000-0002-8791-1178","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773134, 72073135]; Renmin University of China [15XNL004]; Social Science Foundation of Beijing [19GLB023]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Renmin University of China; Social Science Foundation of Beijing,This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71773134]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 72073135]; the special developing and guiding fund for building world-class universities (disciplines) of Renmin University of China [grant number 15XNL004]; Social Science Foundation of Beijing [grant number 19GLB023].,,63,7,7,15,48,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

These failures entail financial and social costs due to frustrated expectations and the time invested in the negotiation process. The objective of this paper is to establish the economic, socio-cultural, organisational and process management factors that underlie this outcome. A survey was conducted among the directors and administrators of a sample of Spanish agri-food cooperatives that had participated in merger processes which were aborted at the negotiation stage or were not approved by their members. Factor and discriminant analyses established the aspects which had the greatest impact on the failure of the merger processes. Far from being economic factors, these analyses reveal that defensive localisms, a lack of commitment to the merger on the part of members and directors, and communication failures were more significant.","[Melia-Marti, Elena; Lajara-Camilleri, Natalia; Julia-Igual, Juan F.] Univ Politecn Valencia, CEGEA, Ctr Invest Gest Empresas, Valencia 46071, Spain; [Martinez-Garcia, Ana] ALIMER, Alimentos Mediterraneo, Murcia 30815, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Melia-Marti, E (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, CEGEA, Ctr Invest Gest Empresas, Valencia 46071, Spain.",anamartinez527@hotmail.com,"Melia-Marti, Elena/K-5154-2016","Melia-Marti, Elena/0000-0002-0417-2139",,,,,82,2,2,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,NOV,2021,11,11,,,,,,,1173,10.3390/agriculture11111173,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11111173,,,19,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,XF0QH,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000723783400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The recent dramatic decline in the number of vinegrowers has been of great concern particularly to wine producers, policy makers, and local authorities because such a pattern has had, and most importantly will have, serious economic, social, and environmental implications. The focus of this paper is on two issues. First, some descriptive statistics on the demographics of vinegrowers and characteristics of vineyards are presented and second, a probit model is developed to identify the demographic and other determinants of the probability of off-farm and off-vineyard work participation. The most important source of data information is primary data collected by the authors, using a questionnaire, which was completed by a representative sample of vinegrowers from the island of Samos. The empirical findings suggest that the promotion of vinegrowing requires policies that will enlarge the size of vineyards, promote investments in human and physical capital, and improve the public infrastructure.","ATINER, Athens 10683, Greece; Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon 74100, Greece",University of Crete,"Papanikos, GT (corresponding author), ATINER, 14 Solomou St, Athens 10683, Greece.",gtp@atiner.gr,"Papadopoulos, Athanasios/M-3412-2014","Papadopoulos, Athanasios/0000-0002-2226-3077",,,,,9,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In addition to linking smallholders to markets, cooperatives provide their members with various services, such as extension, credit, input subsidies, and social programmes. While the literature contains many examples of success, there has been limited discussion on the often long and turbulent process by which cooperatives develop over time and the viable options for shortcuts. This study examines four emerging cocoa cooperatives in Peru to determine their overall business viability, the key factors that advanced their development, and their capacity to address the needs of their members. Our findings suggest that strategies for supporting cooperative development have largely failed to address major internal weaknesses and the challenges posed in the external environment. The cooperatives have received time-bound, uncoordinated, and often small-scale, interventions, which have focused on infrastructure expansion and technical assistance. Important areas related to business management and governance structures, trust relationships with buyers, and sufficient working capital have largely been ignored. Shortcuts may be achieved through improvements in access to business development and financial services, deeper engagement by private sector to support the development process, and commitment by stakeholders to monitoring and critical reflection for strategy refinement.","[Donovan, Jason; Blare, Trent] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lima, Peru; [Poole, Nigel] Sch Oriental & African Studies SOAS, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Donovan, J (corresponding author), World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lima, Peru.",j.donovan@cgiar.org,"Blare, Trent/AAA-3210-2019","Blare, Trent/0000-0002-2318-0409; Poole, Nigel/0000-0002-2157-7883; Donovan, Jason/0000-0001-7733-7451","CGIAR Global Research Program Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA); CGIAR Global Research Program on Policies, Markets, and Institutions (PIM)","CGIAR Global Research Program Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA); CGIAR Global Research Program on Policies, Markets, and Institutions (PIM)","The CGIAR Global Research Program Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA) and CGIAR Global Research Program on Policies, Markets, and Institutions (PIM) provided funding for this research.",,38,14,15,2,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

A variety of diverse studies on the Almeria agricultural and credit cooperative sector and the exploration of social-economic and eco-social indicators, in addition to economic-market indicators are presented. Each correspond to a cooperative logic that spans theoretical perspectives from the dominant economic-market model, new institutionalism, and an eco-social approach, echoing theories on collective coordination governance, and the avoidance of the tragedy of the commons. The latter is of particular importance given environmental challenges and scarce resources for agricultural activity. The cooperatives in Almeria have increasingly relied on collective collaboration and coordination in order to meet social-economic and social-ecological challenges, transforming their role from that founded on a market dominant logic to that of cooperation as a coordination mechanism based on the mutual benefit of the community and environment. In turn, their ability to meet a wide range of needs and challenges of members and the community leads to their longevity. Cooperatives are able to act as both a market and non-market coordination mechanism, balancing the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, such that neither market nor non-market logics are dominant or exclusive.","[Giagnocavo, Cynthia] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Catedra Coexphal UAL, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CeiA3, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Galdeano-Gomez, Emilio; Carlos Perez-Mesa, Juan] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CeiA3, Almeria 04120, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Giagnocavo, C (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Catedra Coexphal UAL, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CeiA3, Almeria 04120, Spain.",cgiagnocavo@ual.es; galdeano@ual.es; juancarl@ual.es,"Giagnocavo, Cynthia/AAA-8983-2019; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014","Giagnocavo, Cynthia/0000-0001-9349-9581; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475; Galdeano Gomez, Emilio/0000-0001-5414-4331","Andalusian government for the R&D project of Excellence [P12-SEJ-2555]; European Union H2020, large scale pilot, Internet of Food and Farm 2020 IoF2020; Spanish MCINN; FEDER projects [ECO2017-82347-P, ECO2015-66504-P]; CeiA3 Campus of Excellence; CIAMBITAL of the University of Almeria","Andalusian government for the R&D project of Excellence; European Union H2020, large scale pilot, Internet of Food and Farm 2020 IoF2020; Spanish MCINN(Spanish Government); FEDER projects; CeiA3 Campus of Excellence; CIAMBITAL of the University of Almeria","The authors' would like to acknowledge support from the Andalusian government for the R&D project of Excellence P12-SEJ-2555; the European Union H2020, large scale pilot, Internet of Food and Farm 2020 IoF2020, and by the Spanish MCINN and FEDER projects ECO2017-82347-P and ECO2015-66504-P.

This paper reports a study that applied a choice experiment method in a novel setting to increase understanding of the preferences of investors in agricultural firms. A large questionnaire dataset consisting of 845 financially literate subjects enabled testing of the form in which residual and control rights provide incentives for non-producer investors to invest in agricultural firms. The choice experiment data were analyzed using a latent class model. The results demonstrate that the subjects were interested in the currently hypothetical, new types of investment instruments in agricultural producer cooperatives. Three investor classes were distinguished based on the preferences: return-seeking, ownership-oriented and risk-averse investors. Who controls the firm appears to be irrelevant concerning willingness to invest, while the rural ties of the respondent are positively related to the preference for voting rights.","[Alho, Eeva] Pellervo Econ Res PTT, Helsinki, Finland; [Alho, Eeva] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Alho, E (corresponding author), Pellervo Econ Res PTT, Helsinki, Finland.;Alho, E (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",eeva.alho@ptt.fi,,,,,,,85,3,3,0,14,SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURAL SOC FINLAND,UNIV HELSINSKI,"MTT AGRIFOOD RES FINLAND, AGRIC & FOOD SCI, EDITORIAL OFF, DEPT AGRIC SCI, PO BOX 27, UNIV HELSINSKI, FI-00014, FINLAND",1459-6067,1795-1895,,AGR FOOD SCI,Agr.

There are 26224 Agriculture Co-operative Societies in the state among them many co-operatives are engaged with horticulture sector in Gujarat state. Amalsad Co-operative works in a highly competitive market. There are more than 15 private traders in the Amalsad market. But the co-operative accounts for 60% of the total market arrivals of fruits. With a paid up capital of Rs. 9.16 lakh and reserve funds of the order of Rs. 5.53 crore, the Amalsad Co-operative shows a robust financial performance. The cooperative made a profit of Rs. 46.89 lakh in 2006-07. Besides, the co-operative owns a petrol pump and a cloth store at Amalsad, though there is also a departmental store in the compound of the co-operative. The farmer members are given advance credit and many other input and consumption loans and facilities for the crop. Co-operatives were the main channel used to sell chickoo than regulated market. Highest price was received by farmer members of co-operative society during the corresponding year as compared by APMC and pre-harvest contractor. The main reason for the selection of cooperatives as marketing channel was higher price payment, the quality based and timely payment. Amalsad Co-operative Society had got two awards for the year 2006-07 i. e. National Productivity Award, 2006 and NCDC Award, 2006. Amalsad Co-operative is able to provide a sustainable solution to the marketing problems in horticulture as it is professionally organized and managed under the able supervision and direction of share holders. In many ways, Amalsad Co-operatives come close to the New Generation Co-operatives. Due to their better marketing abilities, they have been able to gain member loyalty as well as overcome capital constraint which so often is a major problem for co-operative organizations. The role of Amalsad Co-operative is not only to develop the society but also increase the economic condition of the farmers.","[Thakar, K. P.; Patel, D. A.; Darji, V.

At the onset of the war, many officials from the western provinces pressed the central government to fund programmes to allow millions of refugees from Japanese-occupied territory to settle on and cultivate wasteland' (huang) on the peripheries of their jurisdictions. Influenced more by pre-War ideology than the demands of the War, central and provincial governments established land settlement and cultivation zones' (kenzhiqu) in these provinces. However, these ventures were much less well supported than their proponents had hoped. This was not only because the War strained government financesfunding for kenzhiqu was always limited relative to support for agricultural cooperativesbut also partly because kenzhiqu attempts to recruit settlers clashed with the acute labour shortage in core zones of unoccupied China, which led to the abandonment of already cultivated land there, and partly because of the mistrust between central and regional governments. Nonetheless, wartime advocacy for more land cultivation in the Northwest did have important repercussions, leading to a renewed interest in penal colonies.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Hist Class & Archaeol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Lawson, J (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Hist Class & Archaeol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",joseph.lawson@ncl.ac.uk,,"Lawson, Joseph/0000-0002-8811-5245",,,,,100,8,8,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0026-749X,1469-8099,,MOD ASIAN STUD,Mod.

In the cooperative (non-cooperative) RJV, the firms (do not) internalize R&D spillovers. We show that, for the domestic firm, the cooperative RJV dominates, and licensing is the least desirable alternative. Although licensing is dominant for the foreign firm, it is not implementable. Both RJVs are implementable. Implementation of both types of RJVs improves the competitiveness of the domestic firm and welfare. This study yields an important policy prescription: a subsidy policy that induces the foreign firm to accept a feasible cooperative RJV when it strictly prefers a feasible non-cooperative RJV is always welfare improving.","[Aoyama, Naoto] Aomori Publ Univ, Fac Management & Econ, 153-4 Yamazaki, Aomori 0300196, Japan; [Silva, Emilson Caputo Delfino] Univ Alberta, Dept Mkt Business Econ & Law, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Alberta,"Silva, ECD (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Mkt Business Econ & Law, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada.",aoyama@b.nebuta.ac.jp; emilson@ualberta.ca,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [25780166]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780166] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI grant number 25780166.,,58,0,0,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4336,,GAMES-BASEL,Games,APR,2022,13,2,,,,,,,32,10.3390/g13020032,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/g13020032,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,0R2BQ,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000785407800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most current solutions to these problems emphasize strengthening member loyalty and commitment. Yet, many of these solutions are symptomatic rather than fundamental. Searching for fundamental solutions, this paper draws on the Luhmannian system-environment paradigm. Bringing this paradigm to bear on the cooperative scholarship, the paper views cooperatives as operationally closed systems maintaining a precarious relationship to their outer environment, which includes cooperative members. In view of their operational closure, cooperatives tend to overstrain the carrying capacity of their environment by being active in the areas marked by a limited extent of the true commonness of member interests. This overstraining results in a host of problems associated with member heterogeneity. The fundamental solutions following from the system-environment paradigm require the adjustment of cooperative boundaries and goals in light of the evolving range of the true common interests of members. In terms of methodology, we review the extant literature, synthesize the main elements of the system-environment approach and conduct a meta-analysis of case studies and other empirical research to highlight our theoretical arguments.","[Iliopoulos, Constantine] Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Nik Chlorou 1, Athens 11528, Greece; [Valentinov, Vladislav] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Grosse Steinstr 73, D-06099 Halle, Germany; [Valentinov, Vladislav] Interdisciplinary Res Unit Cooperat Studies, Grosse Steinstr 73, D-06099 Halle, Germany; [Valentinov, Vladislav] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Fac Law & Econ, D-06108 Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Iliopoulos, C (corresponding author), Agr Econ Res Inst AGRERI, Nik Chlorou 1, Athens 11528, Greece.",iliopoulosC@agreri.gr; valentinov@iamo.de,"Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Iliopoulos, Constantine/F-9617-2014; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019",", IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Iliopoulos, Constantine/0000-0002-1770-8270; Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646",,,,,94,30,32,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2018,10,4,,,,,,,1271,10.3390/su10041271,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10041271,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ3IY,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000435188000375,View Full Record in Web of Science

The conceptual frame-work developed shows that members of co-operatives have roles to act within their organisation that utilise natural capital. Acting out these roles may see the co-operative become pro-active in governing its natural capital based on economic and social goals which are guided by the co-operative principles and values. Working with the financial services sector, co-operatives would be able to engage with their members to educate and share knowledge on strategies to manage and/or mitigate the risk of natural capital depletion.

However, most existing environmental policies consider ecosystems' desirable properties as given, leading ecosystem managers to favor turnkey solutions. How could public policy better support local collective initiatives aiming at reconciling agriculture and the environment? This paper presents an empirical case study from western France, in which a partnership between an agricultural cooperative and an ecological research center resulted in a collective design initiative. We conceptually model this initiative drawing upon recent design theories and Georgescu-Roegen's 'fund-flow' model, defining 'ecological funds' as the starting point of a collective design process. The results highlight the importance of developing policy instruments that can better support local innovation processes through greater democratization. Adopting a design approach to sustainable agricultural landscape management could be particularly fruitful in situations where collective action is necessary but where there is no common good recognized as such, and no existing community identified.

The achieved results show that the soil hygiene in this region is mainly affected by the activity of this chemical factory. This factory is producing many risky substances and their results can be seen in the condition of soil hygiene and in the quality of farmed plants. The results of monitored heavy metals (Cd, Co, Ni) prove that the content of cadmium and nickel is the main polluting factor of soil in this region.

Design/methodology/approach This research was based on the case study method, combined with ethnographic interviews and document analysis. Findings The findings showed that the industry was highly successful economically, enabling the management to strengthen its authority without sharing information. The decision-making process, thus, became authoritarian, while the community's democratic mechanism was only nominal. This change was also accomplished by cultural transition from cooperative toward more capitalistic values. Management preferred to hire professional workers from the outside without any preference for kibbutz members, causing ethical dilemmas for certain elderly kibbutz members, who felt that the factory had abandoned socialistic ideas. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted only on one kibbutz industry; further research is recommended. Practical implications Management at cooperative organizations needs to realize that in a capitalistic environment, adaptation can cause the organization to lose its cooperative features. To prevent a cultural shift toward capitalistic values, managers need to be socialized and workers persuaded of the importance of cooperative values. Originality/value The study is innovative for its focus on loss of cooperative community and managerial style that has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. This research sheds light on organizational conditions that can cause cooperative communities to lose their democratic and socialistic attributes.","[Moskovich, Yaffa] Zefat Acad Coll, Dept Behav Sci, Safed, Israel",,"Moskovich, Y (corresponding author), Zefat Acad Coll, Dept Behav Sci, Safed, Israel.",mosko777@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-333X,1758-6720,,INT J SOCIOL SOC POL,Int.

This study comprehensively analyzes the literature on credit unions using the leading indices for bibliometric examination: Elsevier's Scopus and Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science databases. Our searches reveal a high level of complementarity between the databases concerning the subject. Their combined use has enabled us to extensively trace the evolution of studies on the subject regarding volume and impact. We identify the major countries, journals, authors, articles, intellectual basis and topics. Further, using CiteSpace, we have mapped the networks of co-authorship, co-citations, and co-keywords in credit union research. The findings allow us to conclude that economics and business finance are the principal areas of credit union research although articles in sociology and history were also observed. Finally, by investigating contemporary co-keywords clusters and future research directions, we identify four main avenues of research: economic performance, corporate governance, accounting and disclosure and, credit union to bank comparisons regarding customer relationships and technology.","[Maia, Saulo Cardoso; de Benedicto, Gideon Carvalho; do Prado, Jose Willer; de Almeida Bispo, Oscar Neto; de Brito, Mozar Jose] UFLA Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Adm, Caixa Postal 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Robb, David Alastair] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Room 313,Colin Clark Bldg,St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Universidade Federal de Lavras; University of Queensland,"Maia, SC (corresponding author), UFLA Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Adm, Caixa Postal 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",saulocm@ufsj.edu.br,"Maia, Saulo Cardoso/M-6528-2017; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; do Prado, José Willer/G-1404-2017","Maia, Saulo Cardoso/0000-0001-6117-4037; do Prado, José Willer/0000-0003-3926-2406",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)-Finance Code 001.,,122,33,37,9,230,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0138-9130,1588-2861,,SCIENTOMETRICS,Scientometrics,SEP,2019,120,3,,,,,929,960,,10.1007/s11192-019-03165-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03165-1,,,32,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,IR4WE,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000481434200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only very few farmers could attend some insurance programs, attend cooperatives or sign contracts to mitigate risk. Because there is a huge population of low-income, resource-poor subsistence farmers, and the investment for agricultural infrastructures is far away from sufficiency and many farmers' livelihood could not be insured, the capacity of farmers' resisting agricultural risks in China is very poor. So governments should strengthen agricultural risk management. Governments should establish special agencies responsible for agricultural risk management and enact relative acts to insure agribusiness and agricultural insurance programs profitable, and take different risk management approaches according to the status of local economy, and encourage and support farmers set up agricultural cooperatives, and intensify financial support for agricultural development.","[Zhang Yong-xia] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,UNIV ELECTRONIC SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY CHINA PRESS,CHENGDU,"UESTC PRESS, CHENGDU, 610054, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81114-983-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,43,49,,,,,,7,Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Government & Law; Public Administration,BIK15,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000260290400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Six informants were selected through a purposive sampling method. The findings indicate that the definition of performance revolves around the dimensions of efficiency (i.e. doing things right) and effectiveness (i.e. doing the right things). This oper-ationalisation of the dimensions fits with the identity of cooperatives. Smallholders' cooperative performance is summarised as the ability to conduct the process of basic management tasks in an efficient and effective manner as well as conform to the expectations of its members. The originality of this study lies in its attempt to investigate the concept of performance using the pragmatic understanding of top management in line with the mental model.

From multi-stakeholder cooperatives to Open Cooperatives in food and farming,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Multi-stakeholder cooperatives; Sustainable food systems; Food policy; Solidarity economy; Open cooperatives; Pro-commons,,"Many authors have proposed cooperatives as one of the preferred governance structures for realising alternative food systems, being recommended both in farming and also downstream at consumer level. However, recommendations for the cooperative model still draw dividing line between producer and consumer cooperatives. As opposed to conventional agricultural cooperatives (ACs) made up of farmer members only, the multi-stakeholder model brings together producers, consumers and/or restaurateurs under one single enterprise. This paper analyses multi-stakeholder cooperatives' (MSCs) potential to recreate more sustainable food flows between rural and urban areas and to overcome the limitations of conventional farmer cooperatives focused more on economic than social and environmental benefits. As part of this research, historical data from cooperative archives is used to look at the history and early attempts of multi-stakeholder cooperation in food and farming. Additionally, current supporting evidence from Spain and UK, in the context of European food policy frameworks, is also presented. A fourfold proposal for open cooperatives is discussed and applied to the analysis of the case studies in the framework of global transformative networks and alliances. The introduction of different types of members seems to both complicate and enrich the cooperative mission, both theoretically and in practice. Their networks with other social movements reveal how the MSCs presented are trying to change, rather than adapt to the market economies they struggle to survive in. The findings suggest MSCs in food and farming are striving to achieve more-than-economic benefits and are moving into the arena of the open and pro-commons economy and other global social movements.

This paper aims to explore the determinants of pig farmers' safe production behaviour, giving special focus from the perspective of cooperatives' services. This study adopted cross sectional survey data from 27 pig cooperatives and their 540 farmers in China to test the influence of cooperatives' services on farmers' safe production behaviour. The hypotheses were tested using a logit regression model. The findings indicated that although the number of services is not a key determinant of farmers' safe production behaviour, service quality matters. When a cooperative is strongly capable of involving more farmers in certain services, and provides certain services in more frequency, member farmers behave more safely. The results also show that veterinarian and pig-selling services play an important role in ensuring farmers' safe production behaviour. For this study, the quality of cooperatives' services is implied to have a positive impact on farmers' safe production behaviour. Leaders/managers of cooperatives must try to improve the quality of their services instead of merely attempting to provide a large number of services. For government officials and policy makers, designing policies that encourage cooperatives to improve their service quality is important. This research contributes to the scant literature on how cooperative services could help farmers engage in safer production behaviour, which would improve the safety of pork products in the future.","[Ji Chen; Chen Qin] Zhejiang Univ, CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Trienekens, Jacques] Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Dept, Business Management & Org, Box 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wang Hai-tao] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Wageningen University & Research; Hefei University of Technology,"Wang, HT (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.",wht288@126.com,"trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403243, 71403077]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We acknowledge the financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403243 and 71403077).,,55,20,20,7,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

We compare the quality of wine producers with and without GIs and test for the effectiveness of GIs based on (a) the strictness of GIs' production standards and (b) GIs' organizational characteristics as a collective brand. We argue that GIs encourage producer quality because they attenuate free-riding problems, provide incentives to invest and facilitate knowledge sharing. Focusing on the Spanish wine industry, the results reveal that except for wineries with the lowest GI category (i.e., protected geographical indication), GI wineries show higher quality than non-GI wineries. We also observe that more stringent categories increase quality but at a decreasing rate. Regarding the influence of organizational features, we found that collective action problems seem to be relevant.

This study analyses how a hybrid cooperative business model can solve horizontal and vertical coor-dination challenges, drawing on an analysis of a pineapple cooperative business, Tropical Pines, in Queensland. Semi-structured interviews with a cross section of key stakeholders and thematic content analysis are used to identify key factors. Leadership, information sharing, trust, market forecasting, risk sharing, accountability, and provision of agronomic and other support to growers are identified as key factors that distinguish this cooper-ative hybrid model from more standard business models. Achieving both horizontal and vertical integration maximises resource utilisation and returns to growers, as well as reducing market uncertainty and maximizing product consistency. However, there are also higher costs involved with hybrid models, particularly the focus on communication and engagement required to maintain the trust of growers. These costs increase with the size and complexity of the cooperative, which creates a tension because size and scale are often required to generate the efficiencies and market power necessary to deliver benefits.","[Rolfe, John; Akbar, Delwar; Rahman, Azad; Rajapaksa, Darshana] CQUnivers, Sch Business & Law, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia; [Rolfe, John] CQUniv, Sch Business & Law, Bruce Highway, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia",Central Queensland University; Central Queensland University,"Rolfe, J (corresponding author), CQUniv, Sch Business & Law, Bruce Highway, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au,"Rajapaksa, Darshana/AGQ-8557-2022","Rajapaksa, Darshana/0000-0002-8161-7963",,,,,54,2,2,8,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

This study examined the factors driving low adoption of vaccination against Newcastle disease (NCD) and Rift Valley fever (RFV) among smallholder women farmers of Nyagatare District in order to identify appropriate strategies that can lead to improved livestock production. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used to collect data on the level of women's participation in household decision making and their involvement at different levels along the vaccine value chain (VVC) for the NCD and RVF. Data were collected from 55 chicken and goat farmers-36 of which were women-as well as representatives of chicken farmer cooperatives, sector veterinarians, agrovet shop owners, and personnel from local NGOs working on livestock production and improvement. Our results reveal that women's ability to use livestock vaccines is constrained by cultural norms that limit their decisions over productive assets and income that they can use for buying vaccines. Women are also hindered by unavailability of livestock vaccines, lack of information and knowledge about livestock vaccination, and limited access to veterinary extension services. Our results highlight a need to organize gender training targeting men and women to change the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that affect women's ability to make independent decisions regarding the purchase and use of vaccines. Women also need training on livestock disease management through vaccination and easy access to veterinary services.","[Mukamana, Liberata; Niyitanga, Fidele; Majyambere, Denis; Kabarungi, Mary] Univ Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda; [Rosenbaum, Marieke; Miller, Beth; Amuguni, Helen] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Schurer, Janna] Univ Global Hlth Equ, Kigali, Rwanda",University of Rwanda; Tufts University,"Mukamana, L (corresponding author), Univ Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda.",liberatamukamana@gmail.com; Marieke.Rosenbaum@tufts.edu; jschurer@gmail.com; beth@bethmiller.org; lfniyitanga@gmail.com; majyamberedenisd@gmail.com; karumary@gmail.com; jamugu01@exchange.tufts.edu,,,"Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund [109061]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Global Affairs Canada; Canada's International Development Research Center (IDRC); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health [KL2TR002545]","Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR); Global Affairs Canada(CGIAR); Canada's International Development Research Center (IDRC)(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS))","This research was funded by the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund under a project titled Hearing their voices-Action research to support women's agency and empowerment in livestock vaccine distribution, delivery and use in Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya.

The objective of this study is to analyze the governance of an agri-food cooperative comprised of farmers with more than 40 years of experience. In addition, we propose, based on the findings obtained, a plan for the organization to integrate the culture of the projects and project management in its governance system. This paper is based on a conceptual framework that takes into account the systemic nature and dynamics of social and organizational interactions, with the aim of moving towards sustainability within the agri-food system, through the analysis of an empiric study in the agriculture cooperative sector in the southeast of Spain. The findings show that working by projects offers a novel and effective governance model for the sector, and that integrating expert and experienced knowledge, working with people, is a fundamental condition for moving towards sustainability.","[Teresa Herrera-Reyes, Ana] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Higher Tech Sch Agron Food & Biosyst Engn, Agroforestry Engn Dept, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [de los Rios Carmenado, Ignacio] Sch Ind Org EOI, Res Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Martinez-Almela, Jesus] Bioagroprojects Biotech PPM, Villarreal 12540, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; ETS de Ingenieria Agronomica Alimentaria de Biosistemas,"Herrera-Reyes, AT (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Higher Tech Sch Agron Food & Biosyst Engn, Agroforestry Engn Dept, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",anateresah@gmail.com; irioscarmenado@learning.eoi.es; jma@bioagroprojects.com,"DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/AAR-5700-2020; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/HGD-4203-2022","DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2015-8983; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2015-8983; Herrera-Reyes, Ana Teresa/0000-0002-9997-7457",,,,,93,9,9,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2018,10,6,,,,,,,1881,10.3390/su10061881,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10061881,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GK9LE,,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000436570100193,View Full Record in Web of Science

Saudi Arabia is particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events, such as arid weather and drought. The purpose of this study is to assess farmers' beliefs and concerns as regards climate change. Extensive interviews were conducted with 164 farmers in the Jazan region. Results revealed that 89.6% of the farmers believed that climate change is due to human activities and 93.3% believed that it is because of natural change. Seventy-five percent of the farmers were concerned about insects and 73% about the prevalence of weeds on their farms. Findings of cluster analysis revealed that farmers who are more likely to believe in climate change are more in agreement with the role of extension services in capacity building. Farmers' beliefs about climate change were significantly influenced by membership of agricultural cooperatives, access to loans, use of extension services, age, farm size, and level of soil fertility. Access to loans was the only significant factor to explain the differences in farmers' concerns. These results suggest the need for capacity-building activities targeted at improving farmers' adaptability to manage climate variability.","[Alotaibi, Bader Alhafi; Kassem, Hazem S.; Muddassir, Muhammad] King Saud Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Kassem, Hazem S.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Nayak, Roshan K.] Univ Calif Agr & Nat Resources, Calif Fdn 4H, Davis, CA 95616 USA",King Saud University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University,"Alotaibi, BA (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Soc, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",balhafi@ksu.edu.sa; hskassem@ksu.edu.sa; rknayak@ucanr.edu; mrajpoot@ksu.edu.sa,"Muddassir, Mohd./ABB-4258-2020; Kassem, Hazem/AAG-9089-2020; Alotaibi, Bader Alahfi/ABG-1067-2021; Kassem, Hazem S/N-2926-2018; Muddassir, Muhammad/IQV-5417-2023","Muddassir, Mohd./0000-0001-7069-2557; Kassem, Hazem/0000-0001-9327-3283; Alhafi-Alotaibi, Bader/0000-0002-9633-4341","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia [RGP-1440-016]","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia","The authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia, for funding this research through Research Group No. RGP-1440-016.",,43,11,11,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUL,2020,10,7,,,,,,,253,10.3390/agriculture10070253,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10070253,,,15,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,MS4HE,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000554238500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Insignificant relationship was found between the male composition in the board with performance. The mean of members' participation (attendance of directors at board meetings) was found to be high but it did have any significant association with cooperative performance.

Specifically, the authors identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China ( traditional and modern ones) when the external environment changes, the cooperative size expands and heterogeneity in membership widens. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assume that the uncertainty of the external environment and the deviation of organisational adaptation constitute the two dynamic factors that generated risks for farmer cooperatives. A survey of 158 farmer cooperatives is obtained in Zhejiang province in 2010, and factor analysis is employed to identify the risks and their critical degrees of traditional and modern cooperatives. Findings - The results indicate that two types of cooperatives in China face drastically different sets of risks. Traditional cooperatives face larger competitive and human resources risks, whereas modern cooperatives face larger decision-making and behavioural risks. Product market risk, macroeconomic policy risk and financial risk are common critical risks faced by both types of cooperatives. Originality/value - In this paper, risks in China's farmer cooperatives were empirically studied and systematically discussed. The paper offers a typology to identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China ( traditional and modern ones) according to property rights arrangements and governance structure.","[Zhang, Ying] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Int Cooperat, Wenzhou, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zu Hui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Wenzhou University; Zhejiang University,"Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhhuang@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [70903052, 71020107028]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Support from the projects No.70903052 and No. 71020107028 funded by the National Science Foundation of China is gratefully acknowledged.,,25,10,10,5,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Yet, its success rate is particularly dependent on the managerial capacities of urban gardeners to coordinate and organize collective actions for the successful exploitation of the gardens. The calls from governments to organize cooperative structures among farmers seem justified and merits a high priority on agricultural policy agendas. Although principles of cooperative structures exist, there is no blueprint available that indicates how to start a gardeners' cooperation. Moreover, these collaborations need to ally with and build on existing social structures of the urban gardeners involved. Our research can contribute to this alignment process by exploring and comparing international standards of prevailing organizations and their functioning among 261 gardeners in two cities in Benin. We found that a vast majority of urban gardeners are members of a cooperation. Nevertheless, their membership is largely titular because gardeners mostly behave semi-autonomously and few decisions are taken collectively. The obvious economic advantages of leveraging bargaining power, reducing transaction costs, and increasing possibilities for loans are seriously underutilized. We suggest that capacity building can help to develop cooperation among urban gardeners to reach their full potential which, congruently, should also improve the livelihoods of the urban poor.","[Houessou, Donald M.; Sonneveld, Ben G.

We consider the case of Mozambique, where the government has made agricultural concessions to corporations, as well as land grants to communities. These uses may stand in competition with one another, and we test if violence affects the awarding of concessions or land grants. We analyze district-level, GIS-generated data on concessions, grants, and civil war events. We find wartime violence intensity is associated with more concessions and fewer grants. We conversely find recentness of violence is associated with fewer concessions and more grants. Embedding our empirical analysis in a community resilience framework, we suggest the intensity of wartime violence may erode local institutions - be they traditional governance structures, or agricultural cooperatives seeking community lands - or limit their access to government bodies and local NGOs tasked with vetting, delimiting, and monitoring proposed concessions. Paradoxically, recentness violence may mobilize those same institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the intense relationship of the cooperative with its environment, previous studies have not considered this relationship. From the financial perspective, our study analyses the mechanisms from which the location and the interaction among economic agents influence the cooperatives. To get this purpose, we develop an empirical application based on a sample of 4.825 Spanish cooperatives and non-cooperatives over the period of 2009-2012. With this sample, we apply panel data and estimate the environment effects (location and interaction) on the productive structure of cooperatives and non-cooperatives. We obtain significant coefficients associated with the spatial structure, thus verifying the relevance of the spatial factors in the financial behaviour of the cooperatives.

However, what the Party has not wanted reformed, and has fought strongly on behalf of, is culture. Using primary source official CPV cultural policy documentation and secondary sources highlighting contemporary meanings of Vietnamese and foreign cultures, this paper evaluates the Party's use of culture as a resource in the direction and regulation of the nation's market economy with a socialist orientation. While culture is expedient for all governments, I argue that the CPV's intent is unique in that it uses culture as an instrument to maintain its ownership, rather than simply to legitimize its regulatory ability, over the national political economy. This paper aims to show how culture is part and parcel of post-socialist governance's political-economic framework and contributes to debates surrounding the reach and impact of neoliberalism in formerly command economies.

This paper explores the organizational characteristics that distinguish POs in the vegetables sector of Uruguay. In comparing organic and conventional vegetables chains, we have identified five types of POs and we have investigated their distinct organizational characteristics. We found, first, that POs in the organic value chain are responding to market incentives, whereas POs in the conventional value chain are responding to public incentives. Second, contrary to POs with a focus on social and political activities, POs with economic activities are small, they have a product focus, they require member investment, and they have a high formalization status. Third, POs with output-driven objectives have higher levels of horizontal and vertical coordination than POs with value-driven objectives. Our study contributes to the increasing body of literature on the internal and external conditions that explain the diversity of POs in developing and transition countries.","[Kormelinck, Annemarie Groot; Bijman, Jos; Trienekens, Jacques] Wageningen Univ & Res, Business Management & Org Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Kormelinck, AG (corresponding author), Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",agrootkormelinck@gmail.com,"bijman, jos/C-2929-2015; trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023","bijman, jos/0000-0001-9143-7870; Groot-Kormelinck, Annemarie/0000-0002-3862-0753",Wageningen University & Research internal funds (Wageningen School of Social Sciences fund); HortEco programme,Wageningen University & Research internal funds (Wageningen School of Social Sciences fund); HortEco programme,Funding comes from Wageningen University & Research internal funds (Wageningen School of Social Sciences fund).

In this article, we propose a method that can operate on nominal and numeric attributes to obtain fuzzy classification rules by combining a competitive neural network with an optimization technique based on variable population particle swarms. The fitness function that controls swarm movement uses a voting criterion that weights, in a fuzzy manner, numeric attribute participation. The efficiency and efficacy of this method are strongly conditioned by how membership functions to each of the fuzzy sets are established. In previous works, this was done by partitioning the range of each numeric attribute at equal-length intervals, centering a triangular function with appropriate overlap in each of them. In this case, an improvement to the fuzzy set generation process is proposed using the Fuzzy C-Means methods. The results obtained were compared to those yielded by the previous version using 11 databases from the UCI repository and three databases from the Ecuadorian financial system one from a credit and savings cooperative and two from banks that grant productive and non-productive credits as well as microcredits. The results obtained were satisfactory.

Smallholder farmers collectively gain economies of scale, access to technology, pool their capital resources to invest in value-added activities and gain bargaining power. Different forms of collective organisations have emerged around the developing world, where smallholder farmers are predominant. Nonetheless, information about the organisational attributes of different collective organisations is scant. This study aims to analyse and compare the organisational attributes of two forms of collective organisations namely, Cooperatives and Farmer Companies (FCs). A range of organisational attributes (ownership, control, benefit, governance, marketing, and external factors) of cooperatives and FCs in the Sri Lankan rice sector are analysed and compared. This study employed qualitative methodology, using face to face semi-structured interviews. Results revealed that cooperatives and FCs have similar control and benefit attributes and different ownership and governance attributes. These FCs accepted external investments while the cooperatives accepted products from non-members. The FCs were more specialised in the specific type of rice grain sold to regional and specific markets. Both types of collective organisations had received substantial governmental financial support, however cooperatives were also strongly influenced by external governmental departments and exempted from tax.","[Fernando, Sanjaya; Garnevska, Elena; Ramilan, Thiagarajah; Shadbolt, Nicola] Massey Univ, Coll Sci, Sch Agr & Environm, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",Massey University,"Fernando, S (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Coll Sci, Sch Agr & Environm, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",prageethaps@agri.rjt.ac.lk,,"Garnevska, Elena/0000-0002-2453-4539",New Zealand Government's Commonwealth Scholarship,New Zealand Government's Commonwealth Scholarship,Funding source This research article has been one of the research outputs of a PhD study supported by the New Zealand Government's Commonwealth Scholarship.,,66,5,5,1,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

The common agricultural policy, through a subsidy policy, has caused a significant proportion of public funding to flow to agricultural subsidies, so it is appropriate to focus on the effect of these subsidies in the context of the sustainable development of EU agriculture. The impact of agricultural subsidies on business performance is of interest to policy makers. In agrarian practice, insufficient attention is paid to the legal form of agricultural performance, so our economic analysis focused on this area of research. The aim of the paper was to evaluate the effect of financial support in the form of subsidies resulting from the EU's common agricultural policy and to verify its connection with the performance of agricultural enterprises in terms of the legal form in the context of sustainable development of the agricultural sector in Slovakia. No statistically significant linear correlation was found between farms' performance results and the volume of subsidies per hectare of agricultural land for each legal form throughout the reporting period.

Doing so promises to lower the cost of achieving agreed climate objectives, which allows countries to increase their mitigation efforts with given resources. Lower costs do not automatically translate into greater climate ambition, however: Transfers that involve questionable mitigation outcomes can effectively increase overall emissions, affirming the need for a sound regulatory framework. As Parties negotiate guidance on the implementation of cooperative approaches under the Paris Agreement, they must consider governance options to secure environmental integrity and address the question of overall climate ambition. But country views are far apart on central questions. Of all the issues under negotiation to operationalize the Paris Agreement, cooperative approaches are the only agenda item still under debate. Drawing on an analytical framework that incorporates economic theory, deliberative jurisprudence, practical case studies, and treaty interpretation, this Article maps central positions of actors in the negotiations and evaluates relevant options included in recent textual proposals. It concludes with a set of recommendations on how operational guidance can balance necessary safeguards for climate ambition with flexibility to contain transaction costs and allow for greater participation.","[Mehling, Michael A.] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mehling, Michael A.] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Strathclyde,"Mehling, MA (corresponding author), MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Mehling, MA (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Sch Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",mmehling@mit.edu,,,,,,,208,1,2,3,10,UNIV CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SCH LAW,BERKELEY,"BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA",0046-1121,,,ECOL LAW QUART,Ecol.

The richness of this case is neither reviewed in geographies of Guyana nor incorporated in leading theories of indigenous territoriality. The government's ambitious agenda of resource development included agricultural cooperatives, a new regional structure of governance, a villagization scheme, a hydropower project, and growth in small-scale mining. Archival research and interviews in two Amerindian villages draw out these projects in specific places to demonstrate how a collective government agenda of racial and resource consolidation redefined or re-placed a diverse indigenous landscape. The legacy of diffuse village-state relations is compromising cultural and territorial integrity as distinct peoples under transitions to neoliberalism in the postsocialist era. Whereas most literature expects essentializations ascribed to clearly defined territories, debates over land rights and resource development in Guyana indicate overlapping spatial and temporal territorializations redefining territory, identity, and space on multiple scales. This complexity is described in terms of liminal indigeneity to reflect the dynamic nature of the movement and to suggest pathways for further research.","[Hennessy, Logan A.] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94712 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Hennessy, LA (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Liberal Studies Program, Burk Hall 238,1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94712 USA.",loganh@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,150,16,17,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

The empirical analytical method is thus used, through the analysis of frequencies and correlations. The results obtained reveal the existence of a suboptimal and heterogeneous degree of digitization of European agri-food cooperatives, clearly conditioned by their size and the wealth of the country where they operate. In this situation, it is recommended to promote public policies that guarantee high-performance digital connectivity, an improvement in training in digital skills and the promotion of cooperative integration processes.","[Jorge-Vazquez, Javier; Chivite-Cebolla, Ma Peana] Catholic Univ Avila, Dept Econ, DEKIS Res Grp, Avila 05005, Spain; [Salinas-Ramos, Francisco] Catholic Univ Avila, Dept Econ, Avila 05005, Spain",Santa Teresa Jesus Catholic University of Avila; Santa Teresa Jesus Catholic University of Avila,"Jorge-Vázquez, J (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Avila, Dept Econ, DEKIS Res Grp, Avila 05005, Spain.",javier.jorge@ucavila.es; mpeana.chivite@ucavila.es; francisco.salinas@ucavila.es,"Jorge-Vázquez, Javier/AAA-2725-2020; Cebolla, Mª Peana Chivite/ABF-2559-2020","Jorge-Vázquez, Javier/0000-0003-3654-7203; Cebolla, Mª Peana Chivite/0000-0003-4774-6259",AAUCAV [BI1920]; Catholic University of Avila,AAUCAV; Catholic University of Avila,"This research was funded by AAUCAV, grant number BI1920 and The APC was partially funded by the incentive granted to the authors by the Catholic University of Avila.",,44,18,18,11,44,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUN,2021,11,6,,,,,,,514,10.3390/agriculture11060514,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060514,,,16,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,SX6SW,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000665333200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the case of agri-food cooperatives in the olive oil producing areas of Spain, a substantial share of the business is based around the social economy, with CIRIEC reporting a cooperativization rate of 70%. As such, there are increasing opportunities for these cooperatives to adopt tools that enable the potential development of social innovation actions. In the present article, we conduct a literature review to explore the definitions of social innovation provided in the last decade. We then analyse the results relating to a proposed model of social innovation applied to the olive oil industry, involving the participation of an expert panel composed of people with a position on the board of directors or managers of olive oil cooperatives and companies in the olive oil industry. From the analysis of the data collected, we identify four dimensions of Social Innovation that are particularly relevant to the olive oil industry: the Economic Dimension, the Cultural Dimension, the Environmental Dimension, and the Technological Dimension. These dimensions give rise to a methodological model for the implementation of Social Innovation actions in the olive oil industry.","[Antonio Parrilla-Gonzalez, Juan] Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Jaen, Spain; [Ortega-Alonso, Diego] Univ Jaen, Dept Didact Artist Express, Jaen, Spain",Universidad de Jaen; Universidad de Jaen,"Parrilla-González, JA (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Jaen, Spain.",japarril@ujaen.es,,"Ortega Alonso, Diego/0000-0002-4190-1871; Parrilla-Gonzalez, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-3849-8775",,,,,49,4,4,1,5,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2021,20,3,,,SI,,119,130,,10.30682/nm2103h,http://dx.doi.org/10.30682/nm2103h,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,YJ0CR,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000744207700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Correspondingly, they are pooling products to quality-differentiated markets and offering quality-differentiated prices to farmers in multiple stages. Methodology/results: We propose a two-stage stochastic program to study the quality coordination problem in a setting where a co-op specifies a quality standard and offers a multistage payment scheme in its contract with multiple farmers who can exert quality-related effort and also show preference toward prompt payment timing. We first analyze a commonly adopted payment scheme, the pooling payment scheme, and then propose an improved payment scheme, the upfront incentive (UI) payment scheme. We find that the pooling payment scheme is able to coordinate the supply chain only when farmers' time preference is higher than a threshold; otherwise, the scheme leads to the problem of over-motivation with respect to effort. However, the UI payment scheme can coordinate the supply chain unconditionally and is also robust to farmers heterogeneous in farm size. We further conduct two extensions, including farmers heterogeneous in farm size and dynamic market size. Managerial implications: The results provide guidance ona co-op's contract design, including quality provision and payment mechanisms in multiple periods.","[Qian, Xiaoyan] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian 116025, Peoples R China; [Olsen, Tava Lennon] Univ Auckland, Business Sch, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; University of Auckland,"Olsen, TL (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Business Sch, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",qianxiaoyan@dufe.edu.cn; t.olsen@auckland.ac.nz,"Olsen, Tava L/G-4460-2019","Olsen, Tava L/0000-0002-5477-6280; Qian, Xiaoyan/0000-0003-4515-6562",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71901054]; Te PunahaMatatini Centre of Research Excellence,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Te PunahaMatatini Centre of Research Excellence,This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71901054].

Yet, it is also by no means static. This article frames the trajectory of Japan's agricultural support and protection regime as a process of gradual endogenous institutional change. The pace and direction of this process are not only determined on the macro level, but also in the 'local'. To illustrate this argument, the article traces the local origins of recent policies toward farmland consolidation surrounding a major revision of the Agricultural Land Law in 2009. This revision deregulated corporate farmland access, but also prepared the ground for a new approach to public farmland allocation to expanding farms. The latter was sourced from certain local farmland governance models. At a closer look, these local models are not only 'best practices' to achieve farmland consolidation, but also reflect the 'defensive' interests of the incumbent local stakeholders of the postwar agricultural support and protection regime, such as the local branches of JA, the powerful organization of agricultural cooperatives. More generally, the article proposes to understand local-national policy transfers as a mode of endogenous institutional change.","[Jentzsch, Hanno] German Inst Japanese Studies, Chiyoda Ku, Jochi Kioizaka Bldg 2F,7-1 Kioicho, Tokyo 1020094, Japan",,"Jentzsch, H (corresponding author), German Inst Japanese Studies, Chiyoda Ku, Jochi Kioizaka Bldg 2F,7-1 Kioicho, Tokyo 1020094, Japan.",jentzsch@dijtokyo.org,,"Jentzsch, Hanno/0000-0002-7570-9159",,,,,74,2,2,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1369-1465,1468-2680,,SOC SCI JPN J,Soc.

We analysed not only direct effects but also the possibilities of mediating these effects to increase the overall effect on IP. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from managers of agribusinesses in Slovakia (175 respondents). We used the partial least squares structural equation modelling method and the appropriate software to test the theoretical research model and the proposed hypotheses to examine the relationships among the individual selected constructs in more depth. The findings point to the existence of a statistically significant relationship between EO and IP, which, however, is weaker than the overall effect of the involvement of mediation variables. Each mediation variable (IWB and KBDC) increases the overall effect separately, but their joint mediation action is of the greatest importance, when full mediation takes place. The strength of the relationship between the two main variables is also influenced by the size of the agrarian enterprise such that being larger has a negative moderation effect. Significant differences were also identified in the legal forms of business in favour of companies over agricultural co-operatives (ACs).","[Jankelova, N.; Joniakova, Z.] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Presov,"Jankelová, N (corresponding author), Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",nadezda.jankelova@euba.sk,"Jankelová, Nadeda/AAS-5404-2020","Jankelová, Nadeda/0000-0002-0045-4737",Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences VEGA [1/0017/20],Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),Supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences VEGA (Project No. 1/0017/20: Changes in the Implementation of Management Functions in the Context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Adaptation Processes in Business in Slovakia) .,,36,4,4,4,27,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The exit behavior meant establishing a marketing or processing operation in parallel to cooperative deliveries or the planning such an action. Scale development to measure cooperative attributes resulted in six latent variables: A need to restructure the farm business, the membership role in the cooperative, opportunity, fear of negative evaluation, self-efficacy, and cooperative (dis)loyalty. The latent variables identified were tested against behavioral intentions in two logistic regressions where the dairy farmers' plans for remaining or exiting the cooperative and their plans for postfarm gate entrepreneurial activities were the dependent variables. Two latent variables emerged as significant predictors: restructuring the farm business and the membership role. These predictors were push factors in the model, suggesting that dissatisfaction with delivery to existing dairy cooperatives, rather than job or life satisfaction from setting up their own business, acted as farmers' motive to exit. These results can be used in developing communication and strategies for more viable dairy cooperatives and in understanding the incentives behind the ongoing restructuring of the dairy market from a supply perspective.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an in-depth case study of a cooperative SC in Vietnam from the perspectives of both the cooperative and its farmers. Findings The study found that cooperative SCs are the most appropriate for Vietnamese farmers. It also identified the key activities needed to engage farmers with cooperative SCs and the mechanisms that the cooperative needs to develop. Cooperative SCs can be enhanced only when farmers are motivated to engage in SC activities and when the cooperative implements a robust management mechanism. Originality/value This study provides new, insightful results on how to engage with small fragmented farmers for SC collaboration and how to enhance the roles of cooperative SCs in the vegetable industry in Vietnam. It also provides information for policymakers to support sustainable vegetable SC development and maintain its sustainability.","[Yang, Ying; Pham, Mai Ha; Sun, Jun Wei] Newcastle Univ, Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Yang, Biao] Univ Sussex, Dept Management, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Tran, Phuong Nguyen Thu] Univ Econ, Sch Int Business & Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Newcastle University - UK; University of Sussex; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,"Yang, Y (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",ying.yang2@newcastle.ac.uk; M.H.Pham2@newcastle.ac.uk; biao.yang@sussex.ac.uk; J.Sun14@newcastle.ac.uk; thuphuong@ueh.edu.vn,"yang, ying/JEF-2607-2023; Tran, Nguyen Thu Phuong/AAR-7422-2021; Yang, Biao/AAS-7380-2021","Tran, Nguyen Thu Phuong/0000-0002-2410-8281; Yang, Biao/0000-0003-3484-8176",,,,,77,8,8,3,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,JAN 3,2022,27,1,,,,,54,65,,10.1108/SCM-05-2020-0194,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-05-2020-0194,,MAY 2021,12,Business; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,XW9XV,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000656995800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, globalization increases competition, and the survival of farmers depends on technological and marketing efficiencies, which represent difficult aspects for settlers to address. Collective organizations are becoming increasingly important; however, these organizations are rare in the settlements. Based on this finding, this study identifies the factors that influence collective action in rural settlements in the Brazilian Midwest. For that, 1162 questionnaires were completed in 54 settlements in the states of the region, and 55 presidents of collective organizations were interviewed. Organizations were classified as commercial, political and mixed, depending on their activities. Most organizations invest mainly in short-term investments for which it is difficult to exclude beneficiaries. Sanctions are rare, and when they are possible, they are rarely applied. This is a problem in commercial organizations, where it is an obstacle for the effective participation of members. In political organizations, membership is not a problem, but the lack of leadership should be addressed. Mixed organizations are not a solution, since the characteristics of political and commercial organizations are antagonistic. The creation of two distinct organizations is preferable.","[Farias de Souza Nogueira, Maria Aparecida; Binotto, Erlaine] Fed Univ Grande Dourados UFGD, Dourados, MS, Brazil; [Vilpoux, Olivier Francois] Catholic Univ Campo Grande UCDB, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados,"Vilpoux, OF (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Campo Grande UCDB, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",marianogueira@ufgd.edu.br; vilpoux@ucdb.br; erlainebinotto@ufgd.edu.br,"Binotto, Erlaine/AAW-4489-2020; Vilpoux, Olivier Francois/E-7816-2015","Binotto, Erlaine/0000-0002-0349-4566; Vilpoux, Olivier Francois/0000-0001-8457-2070; Nogueira, Maria Aparecida Farias de Souza/0000-0001-8410-666X",Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ),Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),This work was supported by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ).,,79,0,0,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted of managers of Brazilian agricultural cooperatives that have strategic alliances and 91 valid questionnaires were obtained. The data collected were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings - Information sharing had positive effects on collaborative innovation and the environmental dimension of social responsibility. No significant relationships were found between information sharing and social responsibility, in the economic and social dimensions, nor between collaborative innovation and social responsibility, in the environmental and economic dimensions. Originality/value - The main contribution of the research is to examine the links between information sharing, collaborative innovation, and social responsibility. The study provides empirical evidence that information sharing between cooperative partnerships favors the exploration of new knowledge/technologies. It also reveals that information sharing helps social responsibility in its environmental dimension by providing information that can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the activities of cooperative alliances. However, it suggests that information sharing influences collaborative innovation and social responsibility in its environmental dimension, but not in its economic and social dimensions.","[Beuren, Ilse Maria; dos Santos, Vanderlei; Bernd, Daniele Cristina; Pazetto, Celliane Ferraz] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Grad Program Accounting, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Beuren, IM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Grad Program Accounting, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",ilse.beuren@gmail.com; vanderleidossantos09@gmail.com; dcbernd@hotmail.com; cellianeferraz@gmail.com,"Beuren, Ilse Maria/AAA-7938-2019","Beuren, Ilse Maria/0000-0003-4007-6408; Bernd, Daniele Cristina/0000-0002-9195-9510",,,,,51,5,6,5,24,FUND ESCOLA COMERCIO ALVARES PENTEADO-FECAP,SAO PAULO SP,"AV DA LIBERDADE 532, SAO PAULO SP, CEP01502-001, BRAZIL",1806-4892,1983-0807,,RBGN-REV BRAS GEST N,RBGN-Rev.

The main reasons discussed in the literature are information asymmetries, which leads to adverse selection and moral hazard, as well as the absence of profit orientation due to poorly specified and diluted property rights. However, although, in reality, many cooperatives indeed perform poorly, and some are apparently able to completely avoid or at least reduce the problems that are considered prototypical for this hybrid organizational form. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics required to reduce the problems resulting from poorly specified property rights and information asymmetries and, hence, to successfully compete in the market. The data we use to identify the characteristics that separate good and bad cooperatives encompass 136 organizations in Austria, Germany, and northern Italy. Our logistic regression estimations show that older and larger cooperatives (in terms of acreage) have a significantly higher probability to be listed in at least one of two highly respected wine guides. Moreover, German cooperatives have a significantly lower probability of being listed than either Austrian or northern Italian cooperatives. The findings suggest that differences in performance can be explained by the management of cooperatives.","[Fanasch, Patrizia; Frick, Bernd] Paderborn Univ, Management Dept, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Frick, Bernd] Castle Seeburg Univ, Dept Sport Econ & Sport Mkt, Seeburgstr 8, A-5201 Seekirchen Salzburg, Austria",University of Paderborn,"Fanasch, P (corresponding author), Paderborn Univ, Management Dept, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",patrizia.fanasch@uni-paderborn.de; bernd.frick@uni-paderborn.de,,"Fanasch, Patrizia/0000-0002-6254-8106",,,,,68,9,9,2,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

In the diagnosis carried out, it was found, through surveys and interviews, documentary analysis and observation of the areas, that there was a lack of knowledge on the subject, which leaves it exposed to any eventuality, especially because of its exposure to natural and biological risks. With the implementation of the methodology, a better identification and evaluation of risks was obtained, mainly in the prevention and control of tobacco cultivation and other various crops. In economic terms, losses and their valuation are minimized or reduced in the event of their materialization or occurrence.

Currently, local products from small-scale farms and national branded products with a relatively large scale of production are being registered using GI schemes. Considering the relationships among GI products, their agricultural landscapes, and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), as a GI case study, we examined small GI farms in Odate City, Akita Prefecture, Japan, which produce edible plants called Tonburi. This research explored the complex cause-effect relationship between TEK and landscapes and found that the TEK of Tonburi production influenced biological diversity and vice versa. The TEK and skills of small farmers were confined to the family members of each farmer and were not shared at the community level until GI registration. However, the farmers shared their TEK of sustainable agricultural landscape management through the process of GI registration. Through negotiation between local agricultural cooperatives and farmers, TEK was provided as a form of cultural capital and shared with new producers after GI registration. We concluded that enclosed TEK negatively affects production maintenance and landscape management in the long term. However, the GI registration process contributes to the sharing of TEK as a form of cultural capital among Tonburi farmers.","[Uchiyama, Yuta; Kohsaka, Ryo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Tashiro, Ai; Uchiyama, Yuta; Kohsaka, Ryo] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan",Nagoya University; Tohoku University,"Kohsaka, R (corresponding author), D2-1 510,Furo Cho,Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",kohsaka@hotmail.com,"Tashiro, Ai/K-8237-2018; Kohsaka, Ryo/J-3022-2019","Tashiro, Ai/0000-0001-6056-2775; Kohsaka, Ryo/0000-0001-6822-4340; Uchiyama, Yuta/0000-0001-7363-896X","JSPS KAKENHI [JP16KK0053, JP17K02105, JP17H01682, JP17H04627]; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [14200126]; Toyota Foundation [D17-N-0107]; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Research Institute for Humanity and Nature; Toyota Foundation; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries(Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan)","This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP16KK0053; JP17K02105; JP17H01682; JP17H04627; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [No. 14200126]; Toyota Foundation [D17-N-0107]; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [Policy Science Research Project 2018].",,46,20,21,6,54,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,,,J RURAL STUD,J.

Meanwhile, on the margins, agro-ecologically oriented tours bring admiring US students, farmers and agrarian advocates. Cubans concur that the country must solve key problems in its agricultural sector to overcome the contradictions of its agri-food model, and that this entails more exchange with the US - but in what capacity and on what terms? The current crossroads begs the classic agrarian question, even as it updates it. Having experienced and survived the promises and disasters of both capitalist and communist agricultural economies, Cuban farmers expand the original peasant' protagonist. As they navigate new non-state markets and recent re-entrenchment of state control of prices, Cuban farmers and cooperatives struggle to avoid monopolizing tendencies of unfettered capitalist as well as communist agricultural economies - both of which have historically been ecologically damaging. US agribusiness courts Cuba, but not as mere unidirectional capture: Cubans are inviting and leveraging trade to end the embargo, which is increasingly being modified altogether. Key Cuban agrarian principles of resilience and cooperativismo have persisted through capitalist and communist crises: could they influence prospects for agro-industrial hegemony from the North?","[Graddy-Lovelace, Garrett] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Graddy-Lovelace, G (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",graddy@american.edu,,,,,,,118,4,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Yet, despite Tunisia was at forefront of introducing them, the uptake of SWCT by farmers has been less broad than desired. This study aims to identdy and analyze those factors that have affected the rate of adoption of SWCT within the Sidi Bouzid governorate of Central Tunisia; a region that is representative of resource-poor environments within the country, and one where land degradation is of both historical and contemporary concern. Employing a binary logistic regression model, with data obtained from a survey of 250 farmers, our results suggest that socio-economic and institutional factors play an important role in the adoption of SWCT. Membership within an agricultural cooperative was positively correlated with adoption. Surprisingly, however, participation in organized trainings for SWCT was negatively correlated with adoption, similarly to livestock holdings. We provide plausible explanations for this counterintuitive finding, together with an argument that conventional processes for knowledge transfer and dissemination are in need of reform.","[Dhehibi, Boubaker] ICARDA, RALSP, Amman, Jordan; [Zucca, Claudio] ICARDA, ILWMP, Rabat, Morocco; [Frija, Aymen] ICARDA, RALSP, Tunis, Tunisia; [Kassam, Shinan N.] Caritas Switzerland, Dushanbe, Tajikistan",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Dhehibi, B (corresponding author), ICARDA, RALSP, Amman, Jordan.",b.dhehibi@cgiar.org,"Zucca, Claudio/K-9167-2013","Zucca, Claudio/0000-0002-8636-0511; Dhehibi, Boubaker/0000-0003-3854-6669",CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems; Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) within the water scarcity initiative of the Near East and North Africa,CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems(CGIAR); Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) within the water scarcity initiative of the Near East and North Africa,"This work was undertaken as part of, and funded by, the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems (http://drylandsystems.cgiar.org/) led by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA: http://www.icarda.org).

To enhance the sheep productivity, 16 Bonga sheep breed improvement cooperatives were established in Kaffa zone of southern Ethiopia. Even though the cooperatives bring success in terms of breed improvement and income generation, there's no empirical evidence of this. Thus, this study was intended to identify factors affecting cooperative membership and estimate its impact on farmers' income. To do this, data from 320 sampled households were collected by using multistage sampling techniques. For analysis, the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model was employed. The result of ESR estimation shows that the probability of farmers' membership decision is decided by the number of sheep owned, extension contact, and proximity to a cooperative office. The model results further confirm that members get significantly better (34%) than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better (56%) than members if they had joined cooperatives. This suggests sheep breeding cooperatives are effective in improving the income of sheep producers. Thus, efforts need to be made to tackle factors that are impeding households' cooperative participation. Further, strengthening of the existing cooperatives and establishment of additional cooperatives is suggested.","[Tarekegn, Kassa] Southern Agr Res Inst, Arba Minch Agr Res Ctr, Awasa, Ethiopia; [Shitaye, Yishak; Gafaro, Tesfaye] Southern Agr Res Inst, Bonga Agr Res Ctr, Awasa, Ethiopia",,"Tarekegn, K (corresponding author), Southern Agr Res Inst, Arba Minch Agr Res Ctr, Awasa, Ethiopia.",kassatar12@gmail.com,"Banta, Yishak Shitaye/ABA-4830-2021; Erekalo, Kassa Tarekegn/ABB-2079-2020","Erekalo, Kassa Tarekegn/0000-0001-9571-1849","Southern Agricultural Research Institute, Ethiopia","Southern Agricultural Research Institute, Ethiopia","This work was supported by the Southern Agricultural Research Institute, Ethiopia.",,59,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2042-1338,2042-1346,,AFR J SCI TECHNOL IN,Afr.

The innovation journey analysis demonstrates that the prefectural government served as an innovation intermediary' to: (1) provide a clear vision of sustainable agriculture for farmers and other actors, (2) create and reinforce both technological and market niches and (3) develop actor networks involving local actors. It also identifies the following roles of the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JAs) and the specialist wholesaler as innovation intermediaries to: (1) develop new farming materials such as fertilizers, (2) translate and deliver practical farming knowledge for farmers and (3) establish the market of environmental-friendly rice. Statistical analysis uncovers that farmers more appreciated the supports from the JAs than those from other intermediaries to participate in the schemes. Complemented by the innovation journey analysis, our findings suggest that the keys to increasing farmers' participation in the schemes include a clear vision and economic incentives for farmers as well as the coordination among intermediaries who have different expertise.","[Kishioka, Tomoya] Kanazawa Univ, Noto Satoyama Satoumi Meister Training Program, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Hashimoto, Shizuka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Nishi, Maiko] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Architecture Planning & Preservat, New York, NY USA; [Saito, Osamu] UNU Inst Adv Studies Sustainabil, Tokyo, Japan; [Kohsaka, Ryo] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan",Kanazawa University; University of Tokyo; Columbia University; United Nations University; Tohoku University,"Hashimoto, S (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",ahash@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Saito, Osamu/AAH-6091-2020; Saito, Osamu/AAU-1495-2021; Hashimoto, Shizuka/I-1948-2018; HASHIMOTO, Shizuka/P-5317-2019; Kohsaka, Ryo/J-3022-2019","Saito, Osamu/0000-0002-0697-9593; Hashimoto, Shizuka/0000-0003-4423-9374; HASHIMOTO, Shizuka/0000-0003-4423-9374; Kohsaka, Ryo/0000-0001-6822-4340; Nishi, Maiko/0000-0001-7323-9168","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-15-1]; JSPS KAKENHI [15KT002, 17KT0076]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15KT0027, 17KT0076] Funding Source: KAKEN","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-15-1) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan; JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 15KT002], [grant number 17KT0076].",,59,6,6,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

The productivity of goat farmers is poorly understood and assumed similar across all households. Cooperatives are hailed as an institution that can provide market power to smallholders in developing countries. We assess the impact of cooperatives on the technical efficiency of goat farmers in Nepal. Multistage sampling and in-person interviews were used to collect information from 334 nonmember and 327 member cooperative farmers from two prominent goat production districts in Nepal. We use translog production function to calculate the technical efficiency. The endogeneity associated with cooperative membership is addressed through an instrumental variable approach. The one-step analysis was used to avoid bias due to the one-sided stochastic frontier analysis error. All conventional inputs have significant and positive impact on performance. Cooperative membership shows positive and significant impact on technical efficiency. The average technical efficiency score of cooperative members was 93.2%, while of nonmembers was 90.7%, and the difference was significant. Variables positively affecting technical efficiency include number of family members in agriculture, education, and training on goat production. Cooperative membership encourages farmers to embark on commercial production, fodder tree planting, farm byproducts utilization and kitchen waste utilization.","[Neupane, Huma; He, Qinying] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Neupane, Huma] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Agr & Anim Sci, Dept Social Sci, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ LSU, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Paudel, Krishna P.] LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Adhikari, Mandeep] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Mol Biosci & Bioengn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",South China Agricultural University; Tribhuvan University; Institute of Agriculture & Animal Science (IAAS) - Nepal; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"He, QY (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",heqy83@scau.edu.cn,"Neupane, Huma/HGD-4136-2022; Adhikari, Mandeep/GXA-1118-2022","Paudel, Krishna/0000-0002-9780-5520; He, Qinying/0000-0003-1234-5690; Neupane, Huma/0000-0002-1592-6522; Adhikari, Mandeep/0000-0001-9171-636X","University Grant Commission, Nepal [76/77-AgFx02010]","University Grant Commission, Nepal(University Grants Commission, India)","University Grant Commission, Nepal, Grant/Award Number: 76/77-Ag& F#x02010;3.",,89,13,13,3,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Due to increased governance through universal codes, standards and certification, Fairtrade risks becoming an abstract ethical and regulatory tool, disconnected from the moral economies of those poor farmers it is intended to benefit. In response, the paper makes a case for a deeper understanding of the moral economies of farmers involved in Fairtrade networks and the ways in which these emerge out of moral experiences that are deeply embedded in local social and cultural relations. Through a case study of Eksteenskuil Agricultural Cooperative in South Africa's Northern Cape, it seeks to demonstrate the importance of understanding the moral experiences of producers to better consider what is at stake for them, focusing on notions of cooperation, fairness and the 'good farmer', perceptions of community, and concerns with survival and self-sufficiency. The paper concludes that working in culturally-sensitive ways with producer communities and understanding how their local moral worlds are structured is vital in bridging the gap between abstract ethical discourses and the place-based moral experiences of producers, and to ensuring the effectiveness of Fairtrade initiatives.","[McEwan, Cheryl] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Hughes, Alex] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Bek, David] Coventry Univ, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Durham University; Newcastle University - UK; Coventry University,"McEwan, C (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Lower Mountjoy,South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",Cheryl.McEwan@durham.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme Trust [F/00128/BE],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors are grateful to the Leverhulme Trust (F/00128/BE) for funding the research.",,57,5,5,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

The logit model and the artificial neural network model have been developed to reflect risk factors to identify the probability of default by each new borrower. The study supports the use of the logit model to develop the system because it gives more accuracy in predicting the probability of default and debtor classification than the artificial neural network model. The working process of the system is classified into two sections including credit risk management, which is the process of screening the loan applications and setting the credit approval or rejection criteria, and affordability risk management, which is the process of determining the maximum loan amount for the debtor who has passed the credit approval criteria. In this study, the author caps the debt service ratio as a threshold for determining the amount of credit (the loan amount approved and interest expense) at 70% and determines that the maximum loan principal is 63% of the debtor's total annual income. The system is also used as an instrument to support the implementation of appropriate credit policies in handling agricultural households' excess debt and promote the building of financial discipline for agricultural households in the rural sector of Thailand.","[Somboon, Songkran] Bank Agr & Agr Cooperat BAAC, Risk Management Dept, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Somboon, S (corresponding author), 2346 Phahonyothin Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.",Songkransomboon@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,"KASERSART UNIV, FAC ECONOMICS",BANGKOK,"CENTER APPLIED ECONOMICS RESEARCH, 50 PHAHON YOTHIN RD, JATUJAK, BANGKOK, 10900, THAILAND",2586-9124,2586-9132,,APPL ECON J,Appl.

Based on the service innovation theory, we propose a novel hybrid multiple criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to evaluate service innovation strategies for improving the sustainability of China's banking industry during the Fintech revolution. A six-dimensional model comprising 20 sub-criteria is constructed and both the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique and DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) are used to explore interrelationships among the indices and their related weights. Finally, the modified VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method is employed to evaluate performance gaps in the four major types of commercial banks in China-state-owned, joint-stock, city commercial banks, and other credit cooperatives-in the field of service innovation. The improvement priorities, ranked from highest to lowest, are new business partners, new service concepts, organizational innovation, technological innovation, new customer interactions, and new revenue models.

Design/methodology/approach - Analysis based on secondary data sources and interviews with people involved when the dominant meat co-operative in Sweden underwent major changes. Findings - The decline in the Swedish meat industry is interpreted using the theory of institutional change presented by Aoki (2007, 2011). The country's former national agricultural policy created a specific set of norms and values. Co-operatives were considered to be indispensable. The co-operative sector was large and hierarchically organised. Therefore, external signals did not create sufficient endogenous processes within the co-operatives. Co-operative adaptation to rising competitive pressure took place only reluctantly and belatedly. Hence many farmer-members defected and the major co-operative faced finally insurmountable problems. A strong ideological conviction caused the once dominant co-operative to collapse and much of the Swedish meat industry to disappear. Originality/value - This study shows that strong ideology (here a conviction about the advantages of politically governed co-operatives) can hamper endogenous processes within an organisation. Management may ignore outside influences, to the extent that even a large industry is impaired. Other large, hierarchically structured and top-governed organisations with a strong ideology may behave in a similar way.","[Nilsson, Jerker] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Lind, Lena W.] Minist Enterprise & Innovat, Rural Growth Div, Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Nilsson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",Jerker.Nilsson@slu.se,,,,,,,33,9,9,1,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A large sample was drawn from a range of co-operative and mutual enterprises, and the suggested model was estimated using a partial least squares approach. Findings Significant relationships were found between all constructs. However, emotional value and affective commitment were found to have particularly strong relationships. Emotional value had a strong influence on both affective and continuance commitment, while affective commitment had a strong influence on loyalty and WOM.

It requires substantial capital to facilitate such a transition, but it is very difficult for farmers in China to access bank credit. One way that commercial farms have to overcome such handicap is by organizing themselves into cooperatives. To assess the effect of cooperatives on the credit accessibility of commercial farms, we have developed a theoretical model as well as an empirical study of commercial farms in Jiangsu Province based on data from a survey of 754 commercial farm owners. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method that control endogeneity problem are used in the analysis. The empirical results show that cooperatives have a significant positive impact on the credit access of commercial farms. Commercial farms participating in cooperatives may alleviated their credit constraints by about 17.3 percentage points and increase the average credit per capita by nearly 80,000 Yuan. Cooperatives improve the credit access of commercial farms by exerting strong market power and reputation effect based on its organizational advantages.

Of 52 samples that contained pesticide residues, carbendazim was detected in 27 (51.9%) in the concentration range of 0.02-0.04 mg kg(-1), hexythiazox in 22 (42.3%) in the concentration range of 0.02-0.05 mg kg-1, imazalil in 8 (15.0%) in the concentration range of 0.02-1.2 mg kg(-1), imidacloprid in 5 (9.6%) in a concentration range of 0.02-0.07 mg kg(-1) methidathion in 17 (32.6%) in the concentration range of 0.06-1.3 mg kg(-1), and methiocarb in 1 (2%) at a concentration of 0.02 mg kg(-1). Bitertanol, pyriproxyfen, thiabendazole and trichlorfon were not detected in any sample. Although 19 samples contained residues of two or three of the studied pesticides, no sample exceeded the European Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). The results show that despite a high occurrence of pesticide residues in oranges and tangerines from Valencian Community, the contamination levels of these residues could not be considered a serious public health problem according to European Union (EU) regulations.

New farmers' organisations emerged and traditional co-operatives had to search for strategies at multiple levels (markets, membership, services provision, and diversification) to strengthen their position. In this ethnographic study, we analyse three central co-operative values democracy, solidarity, autonomy and their translation and development within the adaptation strategies developed by five farmers' organisations. Despite the many challenges to co-operative values related to a context of market deregulation, the new strategies developed demonstrate the continued importance and rejuvenation of these co-operative values as narratives and practices. In addition, results show a blurring of boundaries between organisations of different kinds (specifically co-operatives and public limited companies) and overlaps in the strategies employed by both (including new forms of collaboration and marketing). Whilst these emerging forms, and the associated strategies and values embodied, could be read as the hybridization of a traditional co-operative approach, we argue that the concept of hybridity unduly polarises cooperatives and corporates in a way that does not acknowledge the implicit plurality of motivations and behaviours in all forms of business structure. Consequently, the paper argues that looking at the practices of co-operation, beyond rigid categories, helps to understand better how co-operative values are actually enacted within farmers' organisations.

The project aimed at introducing compost production and use in the village of Al Jalameh, Palestine. This paper describes the successes and lessons from the pilot project. Methods Based on the data collected on the population, waste production and economic activities, the best production methodology and composting units were designed and piloted. The compost was produced from animal manure, farm waste and organic fraction of domestic solid waste. Approaches to increase profit and sustain the initiative was implemented. Results The facility managed by Al Jalameh Agricultural Cooperative Society, recycles 60% organic fraction of domestic waste reducing the quantity of waste to the landfill. An estimated 1425 m(3)/year of compost are required for local agriculture while 800 tons/year is produced. With most of their compost coming from Israeli sources, the composting facility is at a competitive advantage. To increase the profit, around 28,125 kg of waste plastic sheets from greenhouses are collected for recycling each year generating a stable income of 5625.00 JOD/year. Conclusions The compost produced in the village is purchased by the local farmers increasing access to compost at competitive price. Farmers are economically encouraged by compost production that could solve the organic waste management issue and at the same time guarantee a sort of self-production of fertiliser useful for local agriculture. This initiative could be extended to other villages in Jenin and other developing countries where agriculture is their major occupation.","[Bonoli, Alessandra; Zanni, Sara; Awere, Eric] Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn DICAM, Via Terracini 28, I-40131 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Awere, E (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn DICAM, Via Terracini 28, I-40131 Bologna, Italy.",alessandra.bonoli@unibo.it; sara.zanni7@unibo.it; eric.awere2@unibo.it,"Zanni, Sara/ABI-6134-2020; Awere, Eric/ABI-6135-2020; Bonoli, Alessandra/D-5390-2019","Zanni, Sara/0000-0002-4766-992X; Awere, Eric/0000-0001-6084-7877;",Arab American University of Jenin (AAUJ); Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees (PARC); Al Jalameh Agricultural Cooperative Society; JSC (Joint Service Council for Solid Waste Management in the Governorate of Ramallah and Al Bireh),Arab American University of Jenin (AAUJ); Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees (PARC); Al Jalameh Agricultural Cooperative Society; JSC (Joint Service Council for Solid Waste Management in the Governorate of Ramallah and Al Bireh),"Authors are grateful to The Nexus Emilia Romagna and Meets Jenin Associations for the study opportunity; the Arab American University of Jenin (AAUJ), Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees (PARC), Al Jalameh Agricultural Cooperative Society and JSC (Joint Service Council for Solid Waste Management in the Governorate of Ramallah and Al Bireh) for supporting in all research phases.",,36,5,5,1,6,"ISLAMIC AZAD UNIV, TONEKABON BRANCH",TONEKABON,"DEPT FISHERIES SCIENCES & MARINE BIOLOGY, VALI ABAD, TONEKABON, IRAN",2195-3228,2251-7715,,INT J RECYCLING ORG,Int.

The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) showed that Can Tho province was the most vulnerable to climate change, followed by Dong Thap and Tien Giang provinces. In particular, the social index sub-indicator showed high vulnerability. The beta regression analysis identified seventeen significant factors influencing the susceptibility of rice farming households in the study area, such as weather information, flood occurrence, drought occurrence, access to extension services, access to credit, and cooperative membership as well as demographic variables and livelihoods related factors. The LVI result suggests the need for the government to consider raising the priority on households in Can Tho province through adaptation support to improve the resilience and adaptive capacity, especially by enhancing the social network in this area to stimulate support from local authorities and farmer groups. The regression results imply that extension services should provide adequate and timely weather information to equip the farmers to be more prepared for climatic shocks. Moreover, credit facilities with low interest rates should be made available, especially to those who are members of agricultural cooperatives.","[Ho, Tien D. N.; Kuwornu, John K.

Cooperatives offer a well-established livelihood strategy and means to support small-holders. This case study examined a Ukrainian cooperative using the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) to understand the role cooperatives play in addressing climate change, and the process by which capacity is used to adapt and/or mitigate climate change. Climate change does not prompt cooperative formation and climate change mitigation might not be a planned outcome in a livelihood strategy. However, modifying the SLF to include climate change outcomes provides a means of understanding the process by which building capacity results in mitigation and adaptation. Cooperative members and stakeholders outside of the cooperative participated in semi-structure interviews. Social capital emerged as a theme with interviewees from all backgrounds. Initially closed networks and distrust prevented members from joining the cooperative. As the cooperative built new networks, the benefit of joining became apparent to members. Information gained through networks improved access to other capitals, improved livelihood outcomes and addressed climate change. Social capital fulfils key roles in the process of capacity building and implementation of sustainable measures; thus improving social capital could arguably be the chief benefit of cooperatives.","[Kopytko, Natalie] Univ Leeds, Leeds Humanities Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Kopytko, N (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Leeds Humanities Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",n.kopytko@leeds.ac.uk,,"Kopytko, Natalie/0000-0002-5164-1233",,,,,47,4,6,2,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

It also helps to select and determine factors influencing farmers' perception and adaptation to uptake organic vegetable farming and to investigate if this in turn supports sustainable development of farmers' livelihood in the study zone. A total of 108 organic farmers of Chiang Mai Organic Agriculture Cooperative were randomly selected from three districts based on current farming practices experience, in transforming to organic vegetable farming in 2013. Information was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussion from January to April 2013. Adaptation of organic farming and farm practice's were analyzed using the three point rating scale method. In order to fulfill the objectives mentioned above, descriptive was used. The findings revealed that a number of farmers in three study areas had previous experience in organic vegetable production, organic vegetable farming practice, i.e., land preparation, vegetable seed, types of crop, planting method, soil nutrient management, pest management, weed management and harvesting. The disadvantages or constraints in small-farmer adoption of organic agriculture include: debt and income, bio-physical and knowledge constraints. The multiple regression analysis results indicated that age, education level, household labor, farm income and extension visit significantly contributed to farmers' perception on organic vegetable production. Moreover, education level, experience, natural water and farmers' networks or membership significantly contributed to farmers' adaptation on organic vegetable production.

A large sample (n = 856) of CME members and IOF customers was drawn from an online consumer panel, with broadly equal numbers in each, who completed a questionnaire examining their CE, CL, and propensity for WOM. A path model, estimated by PLS, was used to examine the relationships between four dimensions of CE (engagement attention, co-development, enthusiasm, and interaction). Although the study did not find significant differences between CME members and IOF customers in terms of the influence CE had on CL and WOM, it did find CME members had higher CE scores across all dimensions. With engagement enthusiasm (EE) as the most influential factor, followed by engagement attention (EA). The study provides empirical evidence of the influence CE has on both CL and WOM, as well as the propensity of CME members to have higher levels of CE. This offers robust support to the importance of mutuality within CME businesses. The study provides further evidence of the importance of CE in fostering CL and WOM, as well as the relative importance of EE enthusiasm and EA in this. For managers of CMEs the study shows the strength of mutuality in fostering member CE. For IOF managers, it suggests that CE does matter, and it should be monitored.","[Mazzarol, Tim; Soutar, Geoffrey N.] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Reboud, Sophie] Burgundy Sch Business, Dijon, France; [Clark, Delwyn] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Western Australia; Burgundy School of Business; University of Waikato,"Mazzarol, T (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",tim.mazzarol@uwa.edu.au; geoff.soutar@uwa.edu.au; sophie.reboud@bsb-education.com; dnclark@waikato.ac.nz,"Soutar, Geoffrey/C-2453-2013","Soutar, Geoffrey/0000-0003-1478-788X; Reboud, Sophie/0000-0003-2867-1378; Mazzarol, Tim/0000-0001-7107-7046","Co-operative Enterprise Research Unit (CERU), University of Western Australia","Co-operative Enterprise Research Unit (CERU), University of Western Australia","The project was funded by the Co-operative Enterprise Research Unit (CERU), University of Western Australia.",,154,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

By applying the stakeholder theory, we examine the magnitude of women's participation across MFIs based on their legal characteristics, that is, cooperatives and non-cooperatives across the following dimensions-organizational size, efficiency, loan size, and gender mix. We find that in the case of the cooperative types of MFIs, increases in average loan sizes are associated with decreases in female participation in the administration and governance. Further, the findings demonstrate that with increases in the participation of women borrowers, the number of women in organizational governance also increases. These findings suggest important research and practical implications regarding women's empowerment through participation in mutual cooperative societies. We conclude that credit unions and cooperatives could be an effective tool for enhancing women's participation in organizational administration and governance.","[Bezboruah, Karabi C.] Univ Texas Arlington, Sch Urban & Publ Affairs, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Pillai, Vijayan] Univ Texas Arlington, Sch Social Work, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Bezboruah, KC (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Sch Urban & Publ Affairs, 601S Nedderman Dr,Box 19588, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",bezborua@uta.edu; pillai@uta.edu,"Bezboruah, Karabi C/J-5785-2013","Bezboruah, Karabi C/0000-0001-6070-2010",,,,,68,8,9,3,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0957-8765,1573-7888,,VOLUNTAS,Voluntas,JUN,2015,26,3,,,,,913,940,,10.1007/s11266-014-9467-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11266-014-9467-9,,,28,Social Issues,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Issues,CI3IK,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000354641200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

At this end, it focuses on two research questions: What financial dynamics the Italian cooperatives have involved before, during and after the 2008 crisis, that is, in the decade 2004/2013? Are there statistically differences between business sectors and geographic area? Design/methodology/approach - Secondary data on AIDA database have been used. The financial structure is assessed using two ratios: the financial leverage ratio and quick ratio. The final sample consists of 1,446 cooperatives. The trend and exploratory analysis, analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test have been used. Findings - The financial structure of cooperatives has not been substantially affected by the crisis in any geographic area and business sector, by virtue of resilience of their business model. Moreover, these two factors produce statistically significant differences in the financial structure of cooperatives. Research limitations/implications - The study takes into account only the cooperatives that survived the crisis, so, presumably, the strongest. Moreover, another and more ratios should be considered at the end to have a more complete view on the financial dynamics. Originality/value - The literature on resilience of cooperatives is still not very rich. Moreover, this work analyses and integrates aspects and approaches that are not usually considered together.","[Fusco, Floriana] Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Management & Local Dev, Benevento, Italy; [Migliaccio, Guido] Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Business Adm & Accounting, Benevento, Italy",University of Sannio; University of Sannio,"Fusco, F (corresponding author), Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Management & Local Dev, Benevento, Italy.",floriana.fusco@unisannio.it; guido.migliaccio@unisannio.it,"Fusco, Floriana/AEN-5818-2022; Migliaccio, Guido GM/H-7362-2016","Fusco, Floriana/0000-0002-3488-4970; Migliaccio, Guido GM/0000-0002-8882-7648",,,,,96,18,18,1,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1450-2194,1758-888X,,EUROMED J BUS,EuroMed J.

However, whereas there are practical applications implemented in banks, there are rarely empirical studies about this legal form of banking system. Nowadays, the financial crisis is affecting the development of certain industries and territories. Credit unions, as singular financial organizations, have intangible elements with peculiar characteristics. These characteristics must be studied to manage their competitive advantages and provide management with relevant information for decision making. Through the Delphi analysis, this article will identify the singularities of human capital in these entities. The singularities of the credit union sector show that human resources are potentially more determined to adopt a strong corporate culture and invest more in training. On the other hand, main deficits of credit unions will be their aptitudes and lesser capacities, academic level or low investment in training.","[Segui-Mas, Elies] Univ Politecn Valencia, Fac Adm & Direccio Empreses, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Seguí-Mas, E (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Fac Adm & Direccio Empreses, Edifici 7J,Cami de Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",esegui@cegea.upv.es; rjserver@esp.upv.es,"Server-Izquierdo, Ricardo J/HKE-1532-2023; Seguí-Mas, Elies/L-2292-2014","Seguí-Mas, Elies/0000-0001-6985-4758; Server-Izquierdo, Ricardo/0000-0003-1446-2276",Ministry of Science and Technology [DER2008-03475],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),This study was funded by the Spanish R&D Plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology (DER2008-03475).,,18,6,6,0,10,INTERCIENCIA,CARACAS,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,OCT,2009,34,10,,,,,718,724,,,,,,7,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,538AP,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000273156400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The authors estimate a mixed-effects and two-limit Tobit regression to examine the effect of credit union specific characteristics, banking industry and macroeconomic conditions, on efficiency. Findings Credit unions' CE averaged 38.9 percent compared to 54.4 percent for technical efficiency. The authors find that technical efficiency does not translate into CE and vice versa. Practical implications The authors suggest that when targeting CE, credit union managers would have to make technical efficiency a priority.

Within the DCFTA (Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area) and SME (Small and medium-sized enterprises ) projects it is important to ensure opportunity of certain products constant delivery to european countries. We have investigated this issue for this purpose. An anonimous research of ordinary people and detailed survey of entrepreneurs involved in exports, about land and other resources, financial issues and rediness of sociaty to start business,was carried out to reveal various problems in this field. Interesting results were received after making statistical analysis and relevant conclusions were made. Specifically, research finds that there are material and labor resources and sustainable climatic conditions for the continuous supply of herbs on the EU market in the Imereti Agrozone. In addition, the creation of green and greenhouse industries requires interested population to provide targeted state support for credit availability, quality seed materials and pest control and irrigation infrastructure.

In postwar Japan, agricultural support and protection served as a functional equivalent to welfare provision in rural and semi-rural areas. However, an ongoing agricultural reform process has put pressure on aging smallholders and on JA, the powerful organization of agricultural cooperatives. This article investigates how these local actors have responded to an increasingly hostile socio-economic and political environment. To address this question, the article focuses on hamlet-based collective farming, which is a form of agricultural production that can reproduce the welfare character of the postwar support and protection regime on the local level. Based on field research in several rural and semi-rural communities, the article argues that the functions and the local proliferation of hamlet-based farming are shaped by village institutions: hamlet-level norms and rules governing land use and agricultural cooperation, as well as social ties between hamlets, local co-ops, and local governments. While the integration of village institutions into local cooperative and administrative structures can support a systematic local proliferation of collective farming, municipal and cooperative mergers have rendered such comprehensive local responses more complicated. More generally, the article proposes to investigate local acts of recombining community ties and norms with changing macro policies as a promising analytical angle to understand the ongoing renegotiation of East Asian welfare regimes.","[Jentzsch, Hanno] Univ Vienna, Inst East Asian Studies, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Jentzsch, H (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Inst East Asian Studies, Vienna, Austria.",hanno.jentzsch@univie.ac.at,,"Jentzsch, Hanno/0000-0002-7570-9159",German Institute for Japanese Studies (DIJ) in Tokyo,German Institute for Japanese Studies (DIJ) in Tokyo,The author would like to thank the German Institute for Japanese Studies (DIJ) in Tokyo for supporting this research.,,72,0,0,4,21,PACIFIC AFFAIRS UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,VANCOUVER,"#376-1855 WEST MALL, VANCOUVER, BC V6T 1Z2, CANADA",0030-851X,1715-3379,,PAC AFF,Pac.

Farmers have been exposed to multiple stressors including climate change, and they have managed to adapt to those risks. The adaptation actions undertaken by farmers and their decision making are, however, only poorly understood. By studying adaptation practices undertaken by apple farmers in three regions: Nagano and Kazuno in Japan and Elgin in South Africa, we categorize the adaptation actions into two types: farmer initiated bottom-up adaptation and institution led top-down adaptation. We found that the driver which differentiates the type of adaptation likely adopted was strongly related to the farmers' characteristics, particularly their dependence on the institutions, e.g. the farmers' cooperative, in selling their products. The farmers who rely on the farmers' cooperative for their sales are likely to adopt the institution-led adaptation, whereas the farmers who have established their own sales channels tend to start innovative actions by bottom-up. We further argue that even though the two types have contrasting features, the combinations of the both types of adaptations could lead to more successful adaptation particularly in agriculture. This study also emphasizes that more farm-level studies for various crops and regions are warranted to provide substantial feedbacks to adaptation policy.","[Fujisawa, Mariko; Kobayashi, Kazuhiko] Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Fujisawa, Mariko; New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, ACDI, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Johnston, Peter] Univ Cape Town, CSAG, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Tokyo; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Kobayashi, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Yayoi 1-1-1, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",k.kobayashi.ut@gmail.com,"Kobayashi, Kazuhiko/AAN-7096-2020; New, Mark/A-7684-2008","New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Johnston, Peter/0000-0003-3329-0334","Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)","Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)(CGIAR)","The grant is in 'Theme 4.2-Activity 261' (http://activities.ccafs.cgiar.org/activity.do?id=261), Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) (http://ccafs.cgiar.org/), the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

The objective was to share firsthand experience of participatory research among researchers who were mostly not familiar with this approach. Workshop participants were divided into smaller multidisciplinary groups and given the opportunity to interact with representatives from eight actor positions in the value chain of the agrifood cooperative Terrena located in Western France. The four stages of the workshop were: (1) key actor interviews, (2) sharing proposed solutions for overcoming barriers, and (3) developing possible interdisciplinary concepts. Expressions of frustration were recorded serving both as a motivation for group members to become more aware of the scientific concerns and practices of their colleagues, as well as a recognition that some researchers have better skills integrating qualitative approaches than others. Nevertheless, the workshop format was an effective way to gain a common understanding of the pertinent issues that need to be addressed to meet overall multiactor-approach objectives.

Agricultural projects and agricultural cooperatives are also considered as the basis for agricultural development in the economies of many countries. One of the most important targets of development is to fight poverty and famine, and achieving that depends on how to deal with agricultural lands with good management and scientific methods. The aim of this research is to identify the economic feasibility of one of the agricultural activities in the province of Dhi Qar. The study included 132 farms specialized in the cultivation of wheat crop in the province of Dhi Qar for the agricultural season 2017-2018. The results of the research showed that the projects in the province have economic and technical efficiency and proved the results of the economic feasibility criteria of investment in such projects. The researchers found that the size of the possession 30-50 dunums has both productive and technical efficiency, while the farmers with holdings of more than 50 dunums has the best economic efficiency in the use of available resources, despite the low productivity if the return on investment about 188% in small farms, while the profitability of about 119% dinars, while the capital productivity amounted to about 2.081 dinars, and therefore the researchers recommended the need to encourage investment in the large plants given their ability to absorb technology, reduce average production costs and intensify other resources.","[Barbaz, D.

We analyse the drivers associated with public support for such policy using the contingent valuation method. The role of individuals' psychological aspects, based on the reasoned action approach, along with individuals' views on the country's past regime (i.e., to the former Soviet Union), their awareness about the governmental policy, their sociodemographic characteristics, and household location on their willingness to pay (WTP) for the policy is analysed using an interval regression model. Additionally, we examine changes in individuals' WTP before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated total economic value of the policy is KZT 1335 bn for the length of the program at KZT 267 bn per year, which is approximately half the total program budget, which includes other interventions beyond the creation of production co-operatives. The total economic value of the policy would equal the cost of the whole program after 10 years, indicating public support for this policy amongst Kazakh citizens. Psychological factors, i.e., attitude, perceived social pressure, and perceived behavioural control, and the respondents' awareness of the policy and views on the Soviet Union regime are associated with their WTP. Sociodemographic factors, namely, age, income, and education, are also statistically significant. Finally, the effect of the shocks of COVID-19 is negatively associated with the respondents' WTP.","[Kaliyeva, Samal; Gadanakis, Yiorgos] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Areal, Francisco Jose] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Ctr Rural Econ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Reading; Newcastle University - UK,"Kaliyeva, S (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",s.kaliyeva@pgr.reading.ac.uk; francisco.areal-borrego@newcastle.ac.uk; g.gadanakis@reading.ac.uk,"Gadanakis, Yiorgos/AGU-0342-2022; Kaliyeva, Samal/E-7169-2015; Areal, Francisco Jose/ABC-8321-2021; Areal, Francisco/HPD-8333-2023; Areal, Francisco/J-8114-2015","Kaliyeva, Samal/0000-0002-0655-0682; Areal, Francisco/0000-0003-4625-7680; Gadanakis, Yiorgos/0000-0001-7441-970X; Kaliyeva, Samal/0000-0002-4561-8045",University of Reading; Centre for International Programs (CIP) Bolashak of the Republic of Kazakhstan,University of Reading; Centre for International Programs (CIP) Bolashak of the Republic of Kazakhstan,This study was funded by the University of Reading and the Centre for International Programs (CIP) Bolashak of the Republic of Kazakhstan.,,73,2,2,3,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUL,2021,11,7,,,,,,,642,10.3390/agriculture11070642,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11070642,,,19,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,UB9LI,,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000686158600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This advantage creates the possibility that landowners will demand payments greater than the required minimum, where this minimum required payment is known as the landowner's willingness to accept (WTA). However, in recent studies of conservation costs, researchers have assumed landowners will accept conservation with minimum payments. We investigated the ability of landowners to demand payments above their WTA when a conservation group has identified multiple sites for protection. First, we estimated the maximum payment landowners could potentially demand, which is set when groups of landowners act as a cooperative. Next, through the simulation of conservation auctions, we explored the amount of money above landowners' WTA (i.e., surplus) that conservation groups could cede to secure conservation agreements, again investigating the influence of landowner cooperatives. The simulations showed the informational advantage landowners held could make conservation investments up to 42% more expensive than suggested by the site WTAs. Moreover, all auctions resulted in landowners obtaining payments greater than their WTA; thus, it may be unrealistic to assume landowners will accept conservation contracts with minimum payments. Of particular significance for species conservation, conservation objectives focused on overall species richness, which therefore recognize site complementarity, create an incentive for landowners to form cooperatives to capture surplus. To the contrary, objectives in which sites are substitutes, such as the maximization of species occurrences, create a disincentive for cooperative formation.","[Lennox, Gareth D.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Sheffield; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Lennox, GD (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Alfred Denny Bldg,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",bop08gdl@shef.ac.uk,,"Armsworth, Paul/0000-0003-0918-0573","National Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Department of Agriculture through NSF [EF-0832858]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [0832858] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Homeland Security(United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)); U.S. Department of Agriculture through NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","We thank S.

The troubled performance relationship between credit unions and local government in the UK,LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article argues that the development of British credit unions is being held back by the unclear objectives and performance measures set by different external stakeholders. Credit unions are particularly vulnerable to contradictory accountability requirements, because they can serve a number of different socio-economic purposes. They may therefore face multiple lines of managerial and political accountability in a situation where they remain highly dependent on external stakeholders for funding. Survey evidence shows that the measures widely used to gauge credit union performance are not consistent with the policy objectives of the key stakeholders setting them. Taken together, they also fail to provide a balanced scorecard to support effective internal management decision making and external scrutiny. It is contended that key stakeholders need to compensate for the currently skewed performance score card with indicators that are sensitive to credit unions' specific objectives and to the stage they have reached in the credit union life cycle of development. Proposals for a wider and more appropriate suite of performance indicators are therefore outlined.","Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Davis, P (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,,34,13,13,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0300-3930,1743-9388,,LOCAL GOV STUD,Local Gov.

The change in land management and land use, in addition to economic and social effects, has a major impact on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil, quantity and quality of water resources, and air quality. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the drivers of abandoning agricultural lands in Sanandaj county in Iran using a structural equation modeling method. A systematic random sampling method was followed by a proportionate strategy for the selection of 351 samples from a total of 4500 farmers. Data were collected through a questionnaire developed during a comprehensive literature review. The results showed that the causes of ALA can be categorized into five drivers: economic, social, political, agro-technical, and managerial-legal ones. These drivers have a two-way relationship, both direct and indirect, with each other. According to the farmers' views, the most effective cause of ALA was managerial-legal with a factor loaded value of 0.79. The most important issues in the legal-managerial factor were lack of a strong and efficient land use management for lands around cities, inhibition of land fragmentation Act during the legacy after the culmination of Iran's revolution in 1978, purchasing agricultural lands around the city for housing construction purposes, the problem of segmented farms, and not paying enough attention to establish and enforce agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, better support of legal management issues about agricultural lands leads to better control of land use change (LUC).","[Movahedi, Reza] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Coll Agr, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Jawanmardi, Sina] Univ Coll Omran Toseeh, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Azadi, Hossein; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Azadi, Hossein] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Goli, Imaneh] Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran Sci & Res Branch, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Viira, Ants-Hannes] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Witlox, Frank] Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Tartu, Estonia; [Witlox, Frank] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Bu Ali Sina University; Ghent University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Islamic Azad University; Estonian University of Life Sciences; University of Tartu; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Movahedi, R (corresponding author), Bu Ali Sina Univ, Coll Agr, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran.",r.movahedi@basu.ac.ir,"Goli, Imaneh/ABI-4781-2020; Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008","Goli, Imaneh/0000-0002-5252-3300; Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823; Movahedi, Reza/0000-0001-5210-028X",,,,,84,8,8,6,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,SEP,2021,108,,,,,,,,105588,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105588,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105588,,JUN 2021,10,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UF2TB,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000688430200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We consider cooperatives as firms active on markets and as structures of collective action gathering farmers-members around common strategic goals. Williamson's framework from New Institutional Economics accounts for the embeddedness of firms' strategies and governance in their wider context of development. Under the influence of this context of development, Ostrom's IAD (Institutional Analysis and Development) and SES (Social-Ecological Systems) frameworks, merged in a so-called CIS framework, capture the dynamic interplay between the components of cooperatives. Resorting to a combination between these frameworks, this paper discusses how the interplay between the components of the cooperatives' social-ecological system unfolded in the trajectories of the Walloon dairy cooperatives over the last sixty years. We uncover a double social dilemma at play. On the part of the farmers, the social dilemma anchors itself in the tension between their short-term interests as milk supplier over those of principal investor. On the part of the cooperatives' directors, the social dilemma anchors itself in the features of linking and bridging social capital in the region, unfavourable to inter-cooperative dialogue. In the Walloon Region, these social dilemma constituted a structural driver of the competition between dairy cooperatives and the subsequent inability to cooperate and invest towards successful long-term diversification pathways. We discuss how contextual factors, in particular market features, regulatory frameworks, socio-political features, and institutional support to dialogue, may aggravate, or conversely mitigate the effect of these social dilemma on cooperatives' trajectories. We call for more historically-informed studies on the impact of context on cooperative dynamics and stress the relevance of contextualized approaches to unlock prospective dynamics of collective agency in transition pathways.","[De Herde, Veronique; V.

Generous efforts have been made by various stakeholders such as producers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations, to increase the country's maize yield and productivity. However, the outcome is not as expected to achieve food security and poverty reduction. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing the speed of adoption of the improved maize (BH-540) variety in the Central Gondar zone. A three-stage sampling method was used to select a total of 385 smallholder farmers. Moreover, a negative binomial regression was used to determine factors influencing the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. The negative binomial regression model revealed that the age of the household head, farm size, and membership of the cooperative were statistically significant and positively affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety, whereas distance to the nearest market and access to credit were statistically significant and inversely affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. Therefore, this study suggests that the native administration ought to organize skill division and provide short-range keeping fit packages to input suppliers, producers, traders, and development agents in each district. Moreover, supporting and strengthening the current agricultural cooperatives is advisable to strengthen farmer-to-farmer skill allotment by providing mindfulness conception, benefits, and numerous infrastructures. Furthermore, the trade and market development department should be designed to establish improved seed market institutions in each district.","[Abate, Tadie Mirie; Mekie, Taye Melese; Dessie, Abebe Birara] Univ Gondar, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Agr Econ, POB 196, Gondar, Ethiopia",University of Gondar,"Abate, TM (corresponding author), Univ Gondar, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Agr Econ, POB 196, Gondar, Ethiopia.",tadym21@gmail.com,"Abate, Tadie Mirie/AAD-8689-2021","Abate, Tadie Mirie/0000-0003-2305-3909",University of Gondar; [CART/Re/11/1131/2018],University of Gondar;,Funding Tadie Mirie Abate was supported by University of Gondar (CART/Re/11/1131/2018) .,,38,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,OCT,2022,8,10,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10916,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10916,,OCT 2022,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,5O6DE,36247130,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000872560700025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of organizational structure and variations in legal systems on the MFI dual performance goals. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample that includes 1,518 MFIs from 105 different countries over a period of 20 years, this study analyzes the data by applying a model that includes six categories of organizational structures and variations of legal systems, including both civil and common law, with accounting performance measures for the dependent variables. Findings The analyses provide robust results indicating that MFIs structured as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have better social outreach than all other types of MFIs and exhibit better financial performance than MFIs registered as commercial banks or credit unions. Legal systems also played a role in MFI effectiveness. Research limitations/implications Given the increasing importance of MFIs on economic development globally, this study has relevance on how the impact of MFI structural characteristics and macro-level influences on their dual performance criteria can be translated into management approaches and governance policies that can increase the effectiveness of these dual (i.e. social and financial) goals.

The economic benefits criteria include the level of profit each enterprise type is able to generate for farmers, and the risk protection and marketing advantages each affords to farmers. The study also compared the social benefits that farmers derive from cooperatives and other agricultural organizations. Data were collected from 203 farmers, in six provinces: Tire, Odemis, Kemalpasa, Seferihisar, Foca and Urla in the Aegean region of Turkey, using face-to-face interviews. The study employed the following two different analytic hierarchy process AHP models to determine the enterprise preferences of farmers: Model 1 assessed farmer's enterprise preferences in terms of high profit, low risk and marketing advantages. Model 2 evaluated farmers' enterprise and organization preferences in terms of social benefits, human development and democratic participation. Model 1 indicates that farmers prefer cooperatives (score of 0.632) over firms and dealers. Firms and dealers were assigned preferences scores of 0.239 and 0.129, respectively. In Model 2, farmers prefer cooperatives (0.491). The chamber of farmers and extension were assigned preference scores of 0.273 and 0.236, respectively. In conclusion, farmers still have confidence in the ability of cooperatives to provide the market-related services they need and opportunities for social development and democratic expression. These results may also indicate farmers' satisfaction with their role and influence in determining cooperative governance and modus operandi. Additionally, farmers' positive attitudes and confidence in cooperatives may also be an expression of deeply held values rooted in cultural and institutional traditions of collaboration and group action at the village level over many decades.","[Thomas, Terrence; Gunden, Cihat; Manoi, Manoi A.] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Agribusiness Appl Econ & Agrisci Educ, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Miran, Bulent] Ege Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Izmir, Turkey",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; Ege University,"Thomas, T (corresponding author), N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Agribusiness Appl Econ & Agrisci Educ, 1601 E Market St, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",twthomas@ncat.edu,"Gunden, Cihat/Z-6312-2019",,,,,,10,5,6,1,18,WFL PUBL,HELSINKI,"MERI-RASTILANTIE 3 C, HELSINKI, FI-00980, FINLAND",1459-0255,,,J FOOD AGRIC ENVIRON,J.

The understanding of land management and agriculture is very different between the groups. The paper presents the data of a project which is the collaboration of a Swiss and a Romanian team in a three-year programme (SCOPES programme of Swiss National Science Foundation), in which a survey was carried out with the help of questionnaires. This was applied in a sample of 612 rural households in four municipalities. The main questions focused on land use and land inheritance as well as agriculture. The sample included two generations: the parents and their children (362), men and women. The research team looked for an answer to the question: who are the next generation farmers in Romania and are there cultural and ethnic and also gender-based differences between rural families? As the data show there are four different strategies applied in the four regions. In one, traditional sustainable agriculture was preserved, combined with a high rate of international migration. In another village there is a good perspective for farming, but a lot of young people are going to other sectors of activities. In the third location the former socialist cooperative was transformed into a new type of agricultural cooperative. This region has the best developmental perspectives. In the fourth region agricultural activity is maintained and the local economy also includes other types of activities which are,complementary to agriculture (trade, industry and other services).","[Nemenyi, Agnes] Univ Babes Bolyai, Inst Sociol, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Nemenyi, A (corresponding author), Univ Babes Bolyai, Inst Sociol, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",anemenyi@hiphi.ubbcluj.ro; ruth.rossier@art.admin.ch,,,,,,,7,4,4,5,17,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU MIKOLAJA KOPERNIKA,TORUN,"UL.

In the present work, the effect of thermal processing on phytochemical profiles, antioxidant capacity, and volatile compounds of fig wines was investigated. The results show that varieties of detected volatiles and the content of anthocyanins in fig wines decreased significantly owing to fig drying, while individual phenolic concentration increased. The drying process exhibited no significant effect on the contents of total polyphenols and flavonoids, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and oxygen radical-scavenging capacities, whereas prefermentation heating showed a negative effect on the antioxidant capacity and phenolic compositions, and resulted in a significant decrease of the contents of acetaldehyde and acetoin. Overall, fig drying showed a stronger effect on the flavor profile of fig wines compared with prefermentation heating. Choosing an appropriate thermal processing procedure is essential to preserve the antioxidant capacity and flavor of fig wines. Practical applications Figs are sodium-, fat-, and cholesterol- free, while they are rich in fibers and antioxidants compounds. Our previous study indicates that figs are excellent raw materials for winemaking attributing to their high sugar and polyphenol contents. At present, there is a lack of studies on systematical investigation of the manufacture and the quality control of fig wines. The phytochemical compounds, antioxidant capacity, and volatiles in fig wines as well as the effect of thermal processing during prefermentation were investigated in this study. We expect our study will provide guidance for producing innovative and high quality products in the wine industry. In addition, we hope it could bring huge economic benefits to smallholder farmers and agricultural cooperatives in fig cultivation.","[Lu, Yao; Xu, Kang; Guo, Mengmeng] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Engn, Key Lab Food Proc Technol & Qual Control Shandong, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yao] Jinan Fruit Res Inst China Supply & Mkt Cooperat, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Song, Yinghui] Technol & Promot Ctr Grape & Grape Wine Penglai C, Yantai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhengtao] Guangxi Univ, Coll Light Ind & Food Engn, Nanning, Peoples R China",Shandong Agricultural University; Guangxi University,"Guo, MM (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Engn, Key Lab Food Proc Technol & Qual Control Shandong, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",guomm@sdau.edu.cn,"ZHAO, S/IWV-4219-2023","zhao, zhengtao/0000-0001-8552-4142",Science and Technology Development Plan of Weifang City [2018ZJ1112],Science and Technology Development Plan of Weifang City,"Science and Technology Development Plan of Weifang City, Grant/Award Number: 2018ZJ1112",,37,6,7,4,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0145-8892,1745-4549,,J FOOD PROCESS PRES,J.

The agricultural sector is so extensive that achievement of national goals and high levels of development is practically unattainable without active participation by farmers. Provision of a combination of agricultural functional requirements by cooperatives would lead to enhancement of the standard of living of their members. Rural production cooperatives, also known as agricultural cooperatives, are defined as a modern construct with their own specific organization and management. Cooperatives incorporate their own ruling principles, structures, networks, rules, regulations, and bylaws. These features provide concrete benefits in the process of agricultural development. This paper aims to review the activities of rural agricultural production cooperatives in Iran and propose a strategic planning approach for development and institutionalization of their operations. This qualitative research was conducted in Iran using case study and purposeful sampling method. The proposed strategies for promotion of production cooperatives include: provision of support in terms of financial credits, organizational and management expertise, technical know-how and technology, equipment and training, empowerment of members aimed at transforming them into successful farm managers, promotion of team work among members, and extraction of appropriate information and practical advice from research data provided by contemporary investigations. In conclusion, it is proposed that establishment of cooperatives alongside other issues should be considered by policy makers and local leaders and representatives trusted by farmers be involved in their implementation.","[Fatemi, Mahsa] Shiraz Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Shiraz, Iran",Shiraz University,"Fatemi, M (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Shiraz, Iran.",mahsa.fatemi65@gmail.com,"Fatemi, Mahsa/ABE-1985-2020","Fatemi, Mahsa/0000-0002-9568-9247",,,,,20,0,0,0,9,ACADEMIC JOURNALS,VICTORIA ISLAND,"P O BOX 5170-00200 NAIROBI, VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS 73023, NIGERIA",1991-637X,,,AFR J AGR RES,Afr.

This paper investigates the impact of these two significant changes on the profitability of the Hungarian banking sector between 2003 and 2019 using dynamic panel model estimates. The supervisory change has reduced the profitability of credit institutions and tighter supervision has been implemented. The transformation of the savings co-operative system was in fact an integration that led to the disappearance of savings co-operatives by 2019. Competition in the market has been weakened, which has increased the profitability of the remaining financial institutions.

The application of a maturity model to 15 credit unions in North America revealed that an overall level of KM maturity is at an early stage of development, but there are signs of future improvement. Credit unions operate in a highly competitive, knowledge-intensive financial industry and experience various pressures to increase their efficiency, which they can achieve through the implementation of KM solutions. Despite the absence of official KM strategies, KM projects were introduced locally in order to fill particular knowledge gaps. The availability of IT infrastructure and the implementation of KM-related technologies alone are insufficient to ensure universal success of organizational KM activities. Credit union managers periodically access and use academic research in their decision making. At the same time, they prefer accessing scholarly knowledge in translated form from books, practitioner magazines, and consultants. It was concluded that organizations competing in the knowledge-intensive sector have an inner need for KM solutions.","[Serenko, Alexander] Lakehead Univ, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Bontis, Nick] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Hull, Emily] Interdev Technol, Toronto, ON, Canada",Lakehead University; McMaster University,"Serenko, A (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",aserenko@lakeheadu.ca,"Serenko, Alexander/AAT-2082-2020",,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This study is kindly supported by the research grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

The research was performed on a sample of 175 companies of primary agricultural production in Slovakia. All data was analysed using the SPSS version 22.0 software package. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to assess the internal consistency of scales reliability. The Baron and Kenny mediator model was also used. The hypothesis was confirmed by the research. Complete mediation was identified where up to 91.6% of the overall effect is mediated through the sharing of the information variable. The practical implications of the research point out that the transparency of communication and support of innovations introduce positive effects in relation to the performance of agricultural companies. The IWB support is a predictor of production performance of agricultural companies. However, it does not have a clear effect; the effects of other factors are important. The IWB support positively affects the production performance of companies through the sharing of information between the managers and the employees, which becomes an important tool of innovative management. Agricultural cooperatives and joint stock companies can profit less significantly from the IWB support through the sharing of information than limited liability companies. The effect of IWB support on the production performance of cooperatives in natural expression shows statistically less significant impact.","[Jankelova, Nadezda; Joniakova, Zuzana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Presov; University of Economics Bratislava,"Jankelová, N (corresponding author), Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",nadezda.jankelova@euba.sk,"Jankelová, Nadeda/AAS-5404-2020","Jankelová, Nadeda/0000-0002-0045-4737",Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic; VEGA Project of the Slovak Academy of Sciences [1/0017/20],Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic; VEGA Project of the Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences),Supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic and the VEGA Project of the Slovak Academy of Sciences [Project No. 1/0017/20 (Changes in the Implementation of Management Functions in the Context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution)].,,27,0,0,3,14,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Here we show that acting through machines changes the way people solve these social dilemmas and we present experimental evidence showing that participants program their autonomous vehicles to act more cooperatively than if they were driving themselves. We show that this happens because programming causes selfish shortterm rewards to become less salient, leading to considerations of broader societal goals. We also show that the programmed behavior is influenced by past experience. Finally, we report evidence that the effect generalizes beyond the domain of autonomous vehicles.

Focussing on household off-farm employment decisions and land transfer decisions, we classified the households into six types based on their livelihood strategies, namely, off-farm employment-oriented, balanced, off-farm, idle, professional, and conventional. The survey results indicate that two capital factors, age and education, and two mediating factors, wage and crop prices, are important influences of off-farm employment decisions, whereas factors such as policies and subsidies, machinery, activities organized by local agricultural cooperatives, and land rent substantially influence land transfer decisions. By analysing the characteristics, trends and driving factors of livelihood transitions, i.e., changes in rural household livelihood strategies, from 1993 to 2013, we explored the mechanisms of livelihood transitions. The results indicate that the proportion of conventional households decreased and the proportion of off-farm employment-oriented households and off farm households increased. Agricultural production transformed from a system of scattered households (conventional and off-farm employment-oriented households) into broad-scale management households (professional and balanced households). These changes were the main characteristics of livelihood transitions under rapid industrialization combined with rapid urbanization in the Qingpu district. Rural livelihood transitions exhibited a stepped pattern, going through an initial stage, a self-organizing stage, and a government-led stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Tittor, A",,,,"Tittor, Anne",,,The changing drivers of oil palm cultivation and the persistent narrative of I 'already degraded land'. Insights from Nicaragua,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil palm; Rural history; Nicaragua; Political economy; Bioenergy,RUSH,"The article explores the histories of oil palm in Nicaragua during the 20th century within a drastically changing Political Economy. In Nicaragua, palm oil cultivation dates back to the 1950s, when the United Fruit Company started to plant oil palm on the Atlantic Coast. In the 1980s, due to the agrarian reform of the Sandinista revolution, political conditions and economic strategies changed completely. In this era, a socialist government started to create agricultural cooperatives for oil palm. After the defeat of the revolution, during the neoliberal era of the 1990s, palm oil cultivation expanded in different surges. This expansion was tied to funding from international organizations, especially during the conjuncture of the bioenergy framework, which implied a new narrative of sustainability from the global level. The extent of the territory on which oil palm is cultivated more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2010, and again more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, although the Sandinista government was back in power and not particularly supportive of oil palm. The article argues that although the drivers, the main actors, their specific arguments, funding sources, and policies promoting oil palm have varied over time, the narrative of 'already degraded land' has consistently been used. Social contestations from below point not only to environmental and social consequences, but to the funding schemes and narratives of international institutions sponsoring and promoting oil palm.","[Tittor, Anne] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Res Grp Bioecon & Inequal, Bachstr 18k, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Tittor, A (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Res Grp Bioecon & Inequal, Bachstr 18k, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",anne.tittor@uni-jena.de,,"Tittor, Anne/0000-0002-7114-3602",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The empirical research was carried out during my work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center of InterAmerican Studies (CIAS) at Bielefeld University, Germany within a project called the Americas as Space of Entanglements, supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

This study compares radar and optical data characterizing the development of wheat and rapeseed in an agricultural cooperative in the Czech Republic. Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series of the main vegetation seasons between 2015 and 2018 are processed, analysed, and compared with each other. In 2018, the comparison of data with ground measurement by camera was also used. The temporal development of RVI is affected by noise, which is caused by the composition of imagery from different Relative orbits. The separation of imagery according to the Relative orbit used seemed to provide results more comparable to the phenological curve. Simple linear regression between NDVI and RVI illustrated that considering Relative orbit can slightly increase the Coefficient of determination. By selecting a suitable Relative orbit, the coefficient of determination between NDVI and RVI increased from 0.281 to 0.387 in the case of wheat and from 0.233 to 0.316 in the case of rape monitoring. The RVI for rapeseed and the height of canopy correlation was 0.392. The results for RVI presented in this article demonstrated that monitoring wheat and rapeseed development by Sentinel-1 has potential, however more research needs to be conducted in the areas of spatial and temporal noise removal.","[Tuma, Lukas; Krepl, Vladimir] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Trop AgriSci, Dept Sustainable Technol, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kumhalova, Jitka] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Engn, Dept Machinery Utilizat, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kumhala, Frantisek] Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Agr Machines, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kumhala, F (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Agr Machines, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic.",ltuma@ftz.czu.cz; kumhalova@tf.czu.cz; kumhala@tf.czu.cz; krepl@ftz.czu.cz,"Kumhala, Frantisek/W-3935-2018","Kumhala, Frantisek/0000-0002-7782-6033; Vladimir, KREPL/0000-0001-7490-422X","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20205012, 20213108]; Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Engineering, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [31160/1312/313117]","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Engineering, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","We would like to thank the management of the ZD Vendoli agriculture cooperative for providing agronomic data and Ass.

The methodology includes a literature review, interaction with officials, rice experts and insurance experts, and discussion with farmers. A study was undertaken at province level to assess the impact of using rainfall index as a threshold. Additionally, focused group discussions (FGD) were conducted with rice farmers at the village level. Key issues targeted in the FGD were to understand the behavior and practices during droughts, impact of drought on crop yield, methods already in use to reduce the impact, such as plantation of drought-resistant rice, and the adoption of crop insurance. Data availability is a challenge and has led to withdrawal ofWeather Index Insurance (WII) in 2015. WII have threshold levels based on historical rainfall. Adoption of coping mechanisms, such as drought-resistant rice and irrigation increases the chances of adverse selection. In absence of ground based weather data, a combination of satellite agriculture drought information can be used to make crop insurance more attractive as it would help in reducing basis risk and improving insurers and farmers' confidence in the product. Discussion with farmers, insurance companies, and the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) in Thailand suggested low awareness among farmers about the potential benefits of weather index insurance products. Relatively low compensation is also an obstacle. Proper marketing and awareness raising campaigns should also accompany the introduction of index-based insurance products.","[Sinha, Shweta; Tripathi, Nitin K.] Asian Inst Technol, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Sinha, S (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.",shwet_s@yahoo.com; nitinkt@ait.asia,,"Tripathi, Nitin/0000-0001-5618-2841; Sinha, Shweta/0000-0003-3012-5712",Khon Kaen University,Khon Kaen University,"The research benefitted from valuable inputs and insights from various experts in different government and private organizations in terms of data, stimulating discussion and interviews.

To reduce the pollution, the Vietnamese government has implemented several programs to encourage eco-friendly cultivation practices to discourage the overuse of agro-chemicals. However, farmers in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta have resisted the adoption of these eco-friendly practices. The current study aimed at investigating the factors affecting the adoption of eco-friendly rice production practices. We conducted structured interviews with 202 rice farmers. Analysis using generalized ordered logit regression produced evidence that membership in agricultural cooperatives or clubs, perception of biodiversity losses, perceived ease of use, farmer experience, and the perceived difference in selling price all had positive effects on adoption, while risk perception and the number of paddy plots negatively affected the adoption. We also found that the single eco practice (adoption of one eco-friendly practice in rice farming) had the highest economic achievement. One more interesting finding is that a large proportion of farmers who use conventional methods shared similar characteristics with eco rice farmers. Based on the results, to promote the adoption of eco practices, it is necessary to create an incentive mechanism to encourage farmers to join farmer organizations. In addition, policy makers should focus on informing farmers about mitigating risks such as adverse climatic impacts, polluted water, and other environmental threats. Technical training courses and other information-sharing meetings should also be required to introduce to farmers about the benefits of eco practices.","[Vo Hong Tu; Nguyen Duy Can] Can Tho Univ, Coll Rural Dev, Dept Rural Socioecon, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Takahashi, Yoshifumi; Yabe, Mitsuyasu] Kyushu Univ, Div Int Agr Resource Econ & Business Adm, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agr,Lab Environm Econ, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Kopp, Steven W.] Univ Arkansas, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Can Tho University; Kyushu University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Yabe, M (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Div Int Agr Resource Econ & Business Adm, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agr,Lab Environm Econ, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.",vhtu@ctu.edu.vn; ndcan@ctu.edu.vn; gibun@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp; SKopp@walton.uark.edu; yabe@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Sarkar, Apurbo/HDO-2260-2022","Tu, Vo Hong/0000-0002-7000-1549","RONPAKU, JSPS [R11616]","RONPAKU, JSPS","This study (ID number R11616) was funded by RONPAKU, JSPS.",,57,19,19,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,FEB 6,2018,4,1,,,,,,,1432538,10.1080/23311932.2018.1432538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2018.1432538,,,23,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,HI4YO,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000456458900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The two cases are significantly different in terms of production, volume and scale, however they have evolved in a similar way. Specifically, each of the cooperatives began when a small group of producers organized to collectively obtain inputs. Since then, through a series of stages, they have reached the point of collective transformation and commercialization of a great diversity of products. The first case is the Sobrarbe Agricultural Limited Cooperative (Sociedad Cooperativa Limitada Agropecuaria del Sobrarbe-SCLAS), created in 1983, with its headquarters in Ainsa, the Sobrarbe county seat, in the province of Huesca in the Autonomous Community of Aragon. Sobrarbe County, with a population density below three inhabitants per square kilometer, is one of the areas in Spain that has most intensely suffered a depopulation process since the middle of the 20(th), century. SCLAS has a strong connection with the territory where it operates and is focused on maintaining and promoting agricultural life in Sobrarbe County and the Pyrenean mountains in general. Since its origins as a bakery established to supply bread to the most remote mountainous areas, the cooperative has been expanding to include a range of different facets and activities, such as: (i) supplying fertilizers and seeds; (ii) purchasing and storing harvested crops (cereals, oleaginous seeds, hay); (iii) a cooperative store for food, veterinarian pharmacy, plant health, livestock material, hardware and miscellaneous (work clothing, shoes, etc.); (iv) compound and mineral feed manufacturing; (v) veterinarian service, feed advice, and fiscal and financial advice; (vi) completing paperwork for the CAP and agro-environmental assistance; (vii) plans for new facilities; (viii) technical reports; and (ix) commercial technical management. The endless list of the cooperative's activities provides livestock producers and farmers with a framework for meeting their needs. This would otherwise be difficult, given the disadvantages in a challenging rural setting (poor roads and highways, depopulation, lack of services, etc.). The range of activities carried out by the cooperative was recognized with an Award for Diversification granted at the 1995 Conference of the Spanish Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives (Federacion Espanola de Cooperativas Agrarias). One example of the cooperative's diversification can be seen in its veterinarian services, which provide clinical attention to various animal species, as well as animal feed services, plans for livestock facilities, R&D activities with research institutions, quality controls, a veterinarian pharmacy, management of genealogical books, and the promotion of new production efforts. SCLAS also fulfills an important role by assisting producer groups that have been organized in the county to address natural resource management and the sustainability of agro-livestock activities. Some examples are the Sierra y Canones de Guara Livestock Farmers Association (Asociacion de Ganaderos de la Sierra y Canones de Guara), the Association of Pyrenees Inhabitants (Asociacion de Habitantes del Pirineo), and the Huesca Extensive Meat Producers Community (Comunidad de Productores de Carne Extensiva de Huesca). The second case study is on the Pedroches Valley Agro-Livestock Cooperative (Cooperativa Agroganadera del Valle de los Pedroches-COVAP), located in the southwestern part of the Iberian peninsula. It operates in a territory consisting of 15,000 square kilometers, with a population of 250,000 inhabitants who work primarily in the areas of agricultural and livestock farming. Significant economic activity has been developed during recent years around the agro-food industry and related services. The average altitude in the area is 650 meters above sea level, with low rainfall at 350mm/m(2), and an extreme continental climate. The land is not particularly apt for cereal cultivation or pastureland. The entire territory is dominated by the oak-meadow ecosystem, which is characteristic of the southwest part of the peninsula, with the holm oak (Quercus ilex) as the dominant arboreal species. In this territory COVAP has developed a unique agro-food model that integrates the entire production chain, including animal feed, genetics, breeding centers, a slaughterhouse, a milk industry and the commercialization of all products. The number of dairy cattle has increased to 30,000, distributed in 450 operations; the number of beef cattle integrated into the enterprise is 20,000 and the number of sheep, 180,000. Ninety percent of milk production is distributed in the domestic market, and ten percent in the European Union and other countries. Seventy percent of meat production is distributed in the domestic market and thirty percent in the European Union. Previously, dairy farming was practically non-existent in the area, however at the end of the 1970s, dairy cattle breeding was initiated, and numerous operations were established, with 2-3 cattle per farmer. With COVAP's support to farmers and efforts in commercialization, this area has become one of the most important centers of dairy production in Spain, with an annual production of 220,000 metric tons.","[Chapulle, J.

Although there is an extensive body of literature on comparisons of food safety control practices across different governance structures, these studies have been conducted mainly in terms of qualitative and descriptive analysis. In addition, little attention has been given to family farms. This study addresses the food safety control practices adopted by firms with different governance structures in China. Food safety control is expressed by the following aspects, i.e., pollution-free, green, organic, and/or geographical indication products certification, establishment of production records, and pesticide residue testing. Three types of governance structures that engage in agricultural production are distinguished: farmer cooperatives, agricultural companies, and family farms. The food safety control practices of various governance structures are investigated based on a database that comprises 600 vegetable and fruit enterprises in Zhejiang, China. The results show that (1) pesticide residue testing is adopted by the most firms, followed by products certification, and production records are adopted by the fewest firms, and (2) agricultural companies adopt more food safety control practices than family farms, while farmer cooperatives adopt the fewest food safety control practices. Governance structure features of a cooperative in terms of ownership, decision-making, and income distribution are the main reasons for the low level of food safety control in the cooperative.","[Zhou Jie-hong; Li Kai; Liang Qiao] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Liang, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",runzhou@zju.edu.cn; liangqiao2323@126.com,,"Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863; Zhou, Jiehong/0000-0002-1967-780X","National Social Science Fund of China [13AZD079]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ14G030041, LZ12G03003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333011, 71273234]",National Social Science Fund of China; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (13AZD079), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LQ14G030041 and LZ12G03003), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71333011 and 71273234).",,77,32,34,8,92,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

To evaluate the influence of nitrogen-rich fertilizers on quality characteristics of celery, shelf life tests of celery grown with 2 levels of nitrogen and 2 different nitrogen fertilizers were performed. The treatments of the celery samples were identified as follows: T1, mineral nitrogen (80 kg ha-1); T2, mineral nitrogen (120 kg ha-1); T3, organic nitrogen (80 kg ha-1); T4, organic nitrogen (120 kg ha-1); R4, residual organic nitrogen (120 kg ha-1); and C, untreated control. Celery plants were selected and packaged in either of the following 2 plastic films: antifog polyolefin (AFP) film or microperforated polypropylene (MPP) film. The nitrate contents, weight loss, hardness, changes in color parameters, and total phenols were studied for both packaging types during storage. The results demonstrated that celery fertilized with organic nitrogen and packaged in AFP film reached a shelf life of 37 d. The control sample packaged in MPP film was not marketable after 20 d, but the same untreated sample packaged in AFP film reached a shelf life of 30 d. Practical Application We consider the opportunity to apply a new packaging solution that could increase the shelf life of the product having highest interest on the markets. The positive effect of the organic nitrogen fertilization supply together with the packaging solutions a possible increasing in shelf life, reducing almost completely weight loss, and guaranteeing better hygiene and conservation.

For this purpose, bootstrapped envelopment analysis is applied and the best practice frontier obtained corresponds to decision making units showing the best environmental behaviour. The Malmquist total factor productivity (TFP) is decomposed into technological change, efficiency and environmental change. In the second stage, the correlations of these changes with other management variables of cooperatives are analysed. The indicators obtained, on one hand, advice about the nonseparable distance function estimations when the environmental factor is introduced. On the other hand, the results display a relevant increase in efficiency and environmental components for the period under study showing a high influence from labour qualification, environmental effort and spillover effect in the sector.","Univ Almeria, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-04120 La Canada De San Urbano, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria,"Galdeano-Gómez, E (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Econ Aplicada, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 La Canada De San Urbano, Almeria, Spain.",galdeano@ual.es,"Galdeano-Gómez, Emilio/J-9979-2014","Galdeano Gomez, Emilio/0000-0001-5414-4331",,,,,89,12,14,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I develop a simple theoretical model that posits directors who are racial minorities provide the credit unions they govern with a perspective that shapes lenders' trust of minority applicants. This trust is shaped by homophily and the tendency of individuals to prefer interactions with similar individuals. Using mortgage loan data from a cross-section of credit unions in the United States from 185,446 applications, I find that credit unions where the majority of board members are minorities are less likely to reject a similarly qualified minority applicant than their counterparts. Governance by minority directors significantly reduces the effects of discrimination faced by minority applicants. The board's effect is strongest in minority neighborhoods and where the homophily is stronger between directors and applicants.","[Goenner, Cullen F.] Univ North Dakota, Econ & Finance, Nistler Coll Business & Publ Adm, 293 Centennial Dr Stop 8369, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Goenner, CF (corresponding author), Univ North Dakota, Econ & Finance, Nistler Coll Business & Publ Adm, 293 Centennial Dr Stop 8369, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",cullen.goenner@UND.edu,,,Nistler College of Business and Public Administration at the University of North Dakota,Nistler College of Business and Public Administration at the University of North Dakota,"I would like to thank the editor Punit Arora and three anonymous reviewers of the journal for their insightful comments, which helped to improve this article.

However, they can be accelerated by human activities and therefore increase negative impacts on agricultural production as well as disturbing watershed management. Romania currently faces major environmental challenges and pressure on soil and water resources due to unsustainable farming practices and inappropriate tillage practices. The present work represents the first attempt to test the combined use of radionuclide approaches (i.e. Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex)) to quantify soil erosion changes in cultivated Transylvanian fields (Romania) at different temporal scales. Fourteen soil cores were collected along two transects in a cultivated field and two reference sites were selected to establish the mean reference inventories for both Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex). A value of 5460 +/- 880 Bq m(-2) (n = 10; CV = 16%) was determined for the Cs-137 mean reference inventory for both sites, given as areal activity +/- standard deviation, at 2 sigma confidence interval. As regarding Pb-210(ex) reference inventory, its value (9640 Bq m(-2)) is only given by the areal activity of one soil core from the second site. The high erosion rates obtained with the Pb-210(ex) are approachare an effect of the up and down ploughing practices which took place at the time of the local agricultural cooperative starting in the late 1950s. The middle-term redistribution rates provided by the Cs-137 technique highlighted preponderant deposition processes in the field investigated, reflecting the changes in the cultivation system with ploughing across the slope at the beginning of 1990s.

In most cases, data refers to the total amount of EPC collected, which is lower than EPC generated depending on the extent of application of the collection project. Moreover, results are not correlated to the kind of crops, area and number of farmers involved, making impossible to use them elsewhere. This study aims at estimating EPC generation indices. It focuses on the indirect assessment of EPC generation based on information given by the agronomists of agricultural supplies stores and agricultural cooperatives (stakeholders) consulting farmers. For the study area (Pella prefecture in Greece), EPC waste production was estimated for arable crops, fruits and vegetables and it was found to range from 0.9 to 35.3 pieces/hectare depending on the crop type. The weight of empty plastic pesticide containers (EPPCweight) indices were calculated at 0.97 kg/ha and 4.36 kg/farmer/year which are close to the scarce available literature data. These results can be the basis for the design of an EPC management program in areas where data of this type of wastes is lacking. Other results of this survey indicate that stakeholders (depending on their capacity) could be motivated to organize and operate EPC collection stations as well as to help farmers to comply with the national management plan. Based on the above findings, three alternative scenarios for EPC management are proposed to provide a basis for designing an applicable regional EPC management program.","[Marnasidis, Simeon] Reg Unit Pella Adm Rural Econ & Vet, Edessa 58200, Greece; [Marnasidis, Simeon; Stamatelatou, Katerina; Verikouki, Efstathia] Hellenic Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Aristotelous 18, Patras 26335, Greece; [Stamatelatou, Katerina] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Environm Engn, Vas Sofias 12, Xanthi 67132, Greece; [Kazantzis, Konstantinos] Greek Agr Org Demeter, Inst Plant Breeding & Phytogen Resources, RR Stn 38, Naousa 59035, Greece",Hellenic Open University; Democritus University of Thrace,"Marnasidis, S (corresponding author), Reg Unit Pella Adm Rural Econ & Vet, Edessa 58200, Greece.",marnasidis@pella.gr,"Stamatelatou, Katerina/AAU-3760-2020","Stamatelatou, Katerina/0000-0003-1645-7438",,,,,41,13,13,3,27,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Whole field management (WFM) was compared with SSM using either three acre grids or soil type for soil sampling and fertilizer recommendations. The data indicate that site specific P and K application on corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) did not reliably increase net returns. The main effect of the site specific P and K applications on physical quantities of fertilizer was to redistribute the nutrient applications within fields. Both grid and soil type treatments had lower net return standard deviations than WFM.

Although these cooperatives are governed by clear national guidelines that encourage transparency and accountability to their membership, in reality their ability to realise this may be compromised by an imperative to achieve service delivery in an environment of limited governmental support. Drawing on empirical research undertaken at five agricultural cooperatives in the Elliot area of Eastern Cape Province, we examine the extent to which they are able to balance democratic function with effective programme delivery. We show that the limited capacity of local government to reach out to rural areas promotes heavy competition between cooperatives for government programmes, resulting in a highly skewed distribution of benefits determined primarily by how effectively each can 'reach up' to local service providers to secure them. This encourages cooperatives to elect powerful actors to represent them because they are perceived to have the greater political 'connectedness' required to access these benefits. However, these powerful actors are often less accountable to membership and therefore more likely to disburse benefits to suit their own vested interests. We suggest that, under current conditions, the process of creating effective and legitimate cooperatives must balance strong leadership with a high degree of accountability and transparency to ensure that benefits are disbursed as widely and appropriately as possible to members. Separating executive, judicial and legislative power structures associated with the securing and disbursement of resources to ensure processes are transparent, might be the most practical way of achieving this. Ultimately, if the capacity of the state is strengthened to enable them to 'reach down' to cooperatives more effectively, the need to vest leadership in powerful actors and risk compromising accountability and egalitarian service delivery, might be reduced.","[Gwiriri, Lovemore Christopher; Bennett, James Edward] Coventry Univ, CAWR, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Coventry University,"Gwiriri, LC (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, CAWR, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",gwiriril@uni.coventry.ac.uk,"Gwiriri, Lovemore Christopher/AAZ-8980-2020; Gwiriri, Lovemore Christopher/AAZ-3988-2020","Gwiriri, Lovemore Christopher/0000-0002-6913-3683;",,,,,53,7,8,1,9,"IGITUR, UTRECHT PUBLISHING & ARCHIVING SERVICES",URTRECHT,"POSTBUS 80124, URTRECHT, 3508 TC, NETHERLANDS",1875-0281,,,INT J COMMONS,Int.

The aim of this work is to study resilience and adaptability to crisis in terms of economic results and innovative outcomes of the cooperative business model in the Italian third sector during the COVID pandemic. It uses new evidence from a recent survey on the Italian third sector and consists of two main parts. In the first, the institutionalist literature on contractual failures is assumed as an interpretative key in the comparison between the business model, governance, and routines in social cooperatives versus other non-profit organizations (NPOs) interpreted as third sector entities. In the second, we use the new data from a third sector survey in the Marche region, collected in the late spring of 2021 at the end of the pandemic outbreak. Empirical assumptions concern organizational resilience and adaptation to unexpected negative shocks in cooperatives and other NPOs. The results show that, in the management of the crisis, cooperatives are better able to preserve their human capital and resort to layoffs less often than other NPOs. Shared decision-making, employee involvement, and the adaptability of the work process emerge as dominant organizational characteristics that support resilience and service innovation in cooperatives. The main policy implication concerns the ability of cooperatives to play a stabilizing and a-cyclical role during the crisis and to fill the supply gaps left open by other organizational forms (private, non-profit and the public sector). The originality of the paper lies in its new approach to cooperative organization and in the analysis of the reaction of cooperatives to the pandemic.","[Tortia, Ermanno] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, 5 Via Vigilio Inama, I-38122 Trento, TN, Italy; [Troisi, Roberta] Univ Salerno, Dept Polit Sci & Commun, 132 Via Giovanni Paolo II, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Trento; University of Salerno,"Tortia, E (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, 5 Via Vigilio Inama, I-38122 Trento, TN, Italy.",ermanno.tortia@unitn.it; rtroisi@unisa.it,"Troisi, Roberta/AAF-4563-2022; Troisi, Roberta/AFJ-3513-2022","Tortia, Ermanno/0000-0002-2138-1119",,,,,53,6,6,5,20,NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,MOSCOW,"MYASNITSKAYA, 20, MOSCOW, 101000, RUSSIA",1995-459X,2500-2597,,FORESIGHT STI GOV,Foresight STI Gov.,,2021,15,4,,,,,78,88,,10.17323/2500-2597.2021.4.78.88,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/2500-2597.2021.4.78.88,,,11,Economics; Management,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,XX5FS,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000736321900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among the key components of financial literacy are numeracy and money management skills. Our study examines the relative importance of these components in the determination of consumer debt and household net worth among credit union members in socially disadvantaged areas. The main finding from our analysis is that money management skills are important determinants of financial outcomes but that numeracy has almost no role to play. This result adds to a recent US based behavioural finance literature on the role of attention and planning in consumer finance. Findings are found to be robust when the sample is reduced to only those who have a clear role in household financial decision-making and also when controlling for potential endogeneity. Our findings have policy implications in the UK and elsewhere as credit unions across the world are important players in national financial literacy strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Farmers are producers and the first point of traceability. Their intention and behavior related to implementation of vegetable traceability systems directly determine the success or failure of the implementation of those systems. The objective of this study was to identify factors that affect participation behavior in vegetable traceability systems by using a structural equation model and a logistic regression model. Data collected from a 2019 in-person interview survey of vegetable farmers located in Jiangxi province, China were analyzed. Results from the structural equation model showed that perceived usefulness positively affected farmers' participation intentions and their participation intentions positively affected their participation behavior. The impacts of social influence on perceived usefulness were greater than the impacts of traceability system characteristics on perceived usefulness. Facilitating conditions such as equipment resources, knowledge, and skills that farmers have a significant positive impact on the perceived ease of use. Facilitating conditions and perceived usefulness were two key factors influencing participation intention. Results from the logistic regression model showed that gender, age, marital status, cooperative organization membership, and whether the respondents were near a city had a significant impact on participation intention. The conclusions of this study further expanded the current research scope regarding farmers' quality and safety behaviors and revealed the internal decision-making mechanism for farmers' participation behavior regarding vegetable traceability systems.

The main objective is to identify the main factors affecting the implementation of traceability schemes, under the current supply chain structure and evaluate the theoretical framework identified in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - A specific executive research was conducted, including interviews with key representatives of the sector. The scope of the research was to collect qualitative data with the aid of an unstructured questionnaire with no close-ended questions. The research sample included 22 agricultural cooperatives and private packinghouses located in northern Greece where the core value adding activities of the fresh produce supply chain are taking place. Northern Greece is of high importance for the examined sector as a high percentage of all value adding activities, from production to distribution, are taking place within this region. Findings - In the fresh produce supply chains ephemeral dynamic collaborations prevail which do not allow particular transparency with regard to the exchange of information between their members. Severe inequities recognized between supply chain members regarding their ability to imply traceability systems effectively, their current technological and operational status and the availability to undertake the cost of investment in such systems. Tight profit margins and inadequate knowledge on potential benefits of traceability systems are reported as some of the main factors that hinder investments on sophisticated traceability schemes. Adequate labeling automation with the implementation of machine-readable labeling technologies and the introduction of web-based technologies as a low cost solution are estimated to improve fresh produce traceability and logistics efficiency. Originality/value - Within a limited number of research papers on fresh produce traceability, there is no reference to the Greek produce sector. Thus, this paper progresses knowledge of the Greek produce industry regarding perspectives and key drivers for traceability implementation, supported by the thorough review of the literature.","[Manos, Basil; Manikas, Ioannis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Manikas, I (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",manosb@agro.auth.gr,"Manos, Basil/AAO-6985-2020; Manikas, Ioannis/B-9754-2018","Manikas, Ioannis/0000-0002-4084-1651",,,,,29,42,44,0,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Given recent trends in urban migration and increased opportunities for off-farm work, aging farmers increasingly face problems with farmland succession and usage in China. This study investigates the usage of farmland in the absence of a farm successor. Using multinomial logit regression model and data from rural households, we find that aging farmers without successors tend to have options for farmland usage. Specifically, the presence of a grain subsidy increases the likelihood of keeping the farmland in agriculture-albeit by hiring labor or leasing out farmland and decreases the likelihood of pooling farmland into farming cooperatives as shareholders. Off-farm work decreases the likelihood of using hired labor and leasing out farmland. Rich rural households are less likely to keep farmland idle. Large farm operators are more likely to lease out farmland. Finally, rural people with pension plans are more likely to pool their land in land cooperatives - a less-risky option.","[Zou, Baoling; Luo, Biliang] South China Agr Univ, Natl Sch Agr Inst & Dev, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",South China Agricultural University; Arizona State University,"Mishra, AK (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",bzou2@asu.edu; Ashok.K.Mishra@Asu.edu; luobl@scau.edu.cn,"Zou, Baoling/AAH-2217-2019; Mishra, Ashok K./J-7228-2019","Mishra, Ashok K./0000-0002-0988-1428; zou, baoling/0000-0003-2349-4536","key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Rural Land and Relevant Element Market Cultivation and Reform [71333004]; key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Farmland Titling: Realistic Background, Policy Objective and Effect Evaluation [71742003]; foreign joint training program for doctoral students of South China Agricultural University [2017LHPY006]","key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Rural Land and Relevant Element Market Cultivation and Reform; key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Farmland Titling: Realistic Background, Policy Objective and Effect Evaluation; foreign joint training program for doctoral students of South China Agricultural University","This paper was sponsored by the key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Rural Land and Relevant Element Market Cultivation and Reform (No. 71333004); Farmland Titling: Realistic Background, Policy Objective and Effect Evaluation (No. 71742003); foreign joint training program for doctoral students of South China Agricultural University (No. 2017LHPY006).",,47,75,79,13,115,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,SEP,2018,77,,,,,,437,445,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.001,,,9,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GQ9DW,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000442067100042,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cooperatives in the wine sector of some EU countries even surpass a market share of more than 50%. In Germany, the first wine cooperative was established in 1868 in the Ahr region. Despite the decline in the number of cooperatives, of members and of the vineyard area cultivated by cooperatives, wine cooperatives are still accountable for roughly a quarter of the German vineyard area. Due to developments in the field of sustainability and digitalisation, cooperatives are facing increasing pressure. Based on the definition of cooperatives by the International Co-operative Alliance, one can conclude that cooperatives are a sustainable form of enterprise. A previous study from 2019 showed that sustainability and digitalisation were not mentioned by cooperative management as important topics in the competitive analysis. Also, sustainable management practices have not been analysed explicitly for wine cooperatives so far. We therefore consider sustainability and digitalisation in the context of the strategic management of wine cooperatives. Our article does not aim to show further development in the areas of sustainability and digitalisation but rather to unveil existing managerial practices in order to provide a basis for management decisions. As only limited knowledge exists, a qualitative approach was chosen. Interviews were conducted with the management of wine cooperatives (n = 13) and representatives of the regional and national cooperative associations, which in turn represent the wine cooperatives as a whole (n = 4). A data content analysis was performed. The results describe state of the art of sustainable management practices and digitalisation in wine cooperatives. Even if the understanding of sustainability and digitalisation is quite similar among the respondents, the operationalisation in the cooperatives differs strongly. However, it is clear that innovation, adaptability and sustainability are strongly interlinked. Options for future research and the limitations of the study are provided as well.","[Richter, Barbara; Hanf, Jon H.] Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Dept Wine & Beverage Business, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany",,"Richter, B (corresponding author), Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Dept Wine & Beverage Business, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany.",barbara.richter@hs-gm.de; jon.hanf@hs-gm.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [432888308]; Geisenheim University","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Geisenheim University","We acknowledge support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - project number 432888308 and the Open Access Publishing Fund of Geisenheim University.",,83,11,11,9,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2021,13,10,,,,,,,5543,10.3390/su13105543,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13105543,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ST5LU,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000662485500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climate will continue to evolve as discussed in all IPCC reports and there is a need for farmers, seed companies and agricultural cooperative corporations to be able to anticipate those changes. The ambition of our work is to provide them with the means to get ready to adapt by analyzing a) the time evolution of meteorological stresses and certain management practices throughout the crop's growth cycle, b) the impacts of climate-induced changes in calculated sowing dates on those stresses and practices. We have applied the method we developed in a former paper to study the climatic suitability of maize in two contrasted areas of France, Ile-de-France in the North and Midi-Pyrenees in the South. Three climate change scenarios, two climate models and two maize varieties distinct in terms of precocity were used to try and ensure meaningful results. Whatever the scenario, model and variety, maize will be sown earlier than it is currently the case in both regions, especially in Midi-Pyrenees. Whatever the sowing date, rising temperatures in the future will be favorable for late varieties in the current cooler areas, and therefore even farmers in Ile-de-France will be able to grow varieties with a wide range of crop cycle length. However heat and water stress will increase in both regions between flowering and maturity, irrespective of the sowing date and scenario, thereby limiting the possibility to achieve potential yields. In Midi-Pyrenees compromises will need to be found between early sowing to minimize some later stress and increasing risks of frost during emergence, that do not currently exist.

Rural regions-networks of adjacent communities-having secured a special privileged status of community administration-were organised as a local production system designed to produce specific agricultural or craft products which were then destined for international markets. The present paper aims, first, to bring to light the Greek guild, its internal organization and its geographical impacts; and, second, to investigate the phenomenon of the cooperative community networks. In particular, it presents successful historical examples of cooperative organization, their deeper values and operational rules developed in Eastern Mediterranean during the post-Byzantine period. At the same time, it aims at the study and prominence of the deeper values and motives and main operational rules, firstly on regional micro-level of professional guilds and latterly on a peripheral macrolevel of cooperative forms in between in the wider regions of Greek territory. Four historically successful cases of cooperative organization in the Greek territory thrived during the Ottoman occupation, aspects of which offer useful proposals for the founding and operation of today's cooperative initiatives. The success of these cases is in line with the exploitation of specific political and socio-economic conditions; the parallel growth of an expansive, international commercial network; monopolies' function; and the invention of innovative operation rules of cooperative organization.","[Ierapetritis, Dimitrios G.] Hellen Open Univ, 5-7 Proodou St, Voula 16673, Attica, Greece",,"Ierapetritis, DG (corresponding author), Hellen Open Univ, 5-7 Proodou St, Voula 16673, Attica, Greece.",d.ierapetritis@gmail.com,"Ierapetritis, Dimitrios/AAC-5109-2022; Ierapetritis, Dimitrios/ABC-5940-2021","Ierapetritis, Dimitrios/0000-0003-2646-4658;",,,,,41,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

The current research indicates the different activities developed by this cooperative as part of a sustainable model aimed to permeate in rural communities all over the northeastern Sierra of Puebla. Today the cooperative is integrated by 290 communities from 22 municipalities in the northeastern Sierra of Puebla, whose members are mainly from Nahuatl and Totonaca origin aiming at a sustainable development for their families, communities and the region. The model promoted by the Cooperative is based on the premises of democracy, fair economic participation, self-reliance, autonomy, compromise, gender equality and cooperation, aiming to provide a healthy diet, profitable businesses while employing the community members, stressing the importance of improving their skills on the individual and the collective level. Revaluation, rescue and preservation of their culture are some of the ultimate goals, working within a sustainable framework. This research emphasizes some activities implemented by the cooperative as good examples of sustainable strategies to achieve development in rural areas. A few instances are: The creation of an eco-friendly hotel featuring 15 rooms and 14 cabins where different eco techniques are applied, such as the usage of bamboo for building and a rainwater collector system, among others. Organic pepper and coffee production and trade, as well as the region's endemic honey.

The results suggest that, on average, banks are the most efficient MFIs; while NGOs are, on average, the least efficient MFIs. On average, all 4 groups are more pure technically efficient than scale efficient. Banks, nongovernmental organizations, nonbanking financial institutions, cooperatives and credit unions all seem to have problems with scale efficiency.

However, the income growth rate of farmers is relatively low, and the income gap between urban and rural areas is widening. Using a sample of 1,325 large-scale farming households in Lin'an, this study constructs a theoretical path for how the level of vertical integration and an organization model affect farmers' income levels and empirically tests the path using a mediation effect analysis model. The results indicate that organization models and vertical integration are important factors that affect farmers' income levels. The total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who participate in agricultural operation organizations are greater than that of farmers who do not participate in an operation organization. In addition, the total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who produce and process and those who produce, process, and sell are higher than those of farmers who only produce. A farmers' organization model has both a direct and an indirect positive influence on their income level, with the indirect positive influence coming through the mediating variable of vertical integration. The application of the organizational model can promote the growth of rural households' total family income and agricultural income by 13.48% and 14.48% respectively, consisting of direct increases of 9.67% and 10.19%, and indirect increases of 3.81% and 4.29% through vertical integration. The results also show that access to credit, agricultural technology training, and the farmer's education level have significant positive impacts on farming income levels. The findings suggest ways to increase farmers' income by perfecting agricultural management organization systems, promoting agricultural industrialization, strengthening rural financial support, improving agricultural technical training for farmers, and increasing their level of education.","[Ao, Guiyan; Liu, Qiang; Chen, Minghao; Liu, Shuai; Wu, Weiguang] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ao, Guiyan; Qin, Li] Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Univ Town, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiang; Wu, Weiguang] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Res Acad Rural Revitalizat Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang A&F University; Guizhou University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang A&F University,"Liu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Liu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, Res Acad Rural Revitalizat Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",niumeng119@zju.edu.cn,,"ao, guiyan/0000-0002-9180-1668",Soft Science Project of Zhejiang Provincial Department of Science and Technology [72018C35045]; University Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University [2020YQ011]; Guizhou University of Finance and Economics [2020ZXSY30]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation Key Project [LZ19G030001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71873126],Soft Science Project of Zhejiang Provincial Department of Science and Technology; University Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University; Guizhou University of Finance and Economics; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation Key Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Qiang Liu, the Soft Science Project of Zhejiang Provincial Department of Science and Technology [Grant No. 72018C35045]; Qiang Liu, University Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University [Grant No. 2020YQ011]; Qiang Liu, the Research Funding Project of Guizhou University of Finance and Economics [Grant No. 2020ZXSY30]; Weiguang Wu, Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation Key Project [Grant No. LZ19G030001]; Weiguang Wu, The National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 71873126].",,45,4,4,9,40,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 2,2021,16,6,,,,,,,e0252482,10.1371/journal.pone.0252482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252482,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,SW6QL,34077458,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000664638500046,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although their less negative impact on environment is generally supposed, there is still a lack of a reliable data about their real favourability for the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates, including millipedes. Therefore, the aim of our study was to find out, whether the form of agricultural management affects the structure of millipede communities and hence, the performance of their functions in soil ecosystems. The research was carried out using pitfall trapping through growing seasons 2005 to 2007 on the model territory of Agricultural Cooperative (AC) OCova (Central Slovakia). Millipedes were captured at four pairs of sites (8 sites in total). The same cultivated crop (wheat, barley, alfalfa or permanent law) with application of two different forms of agricultural management (conventional form and sustainable form with basic sustainable agro-environmental scheme) was characteristic of each pair of sites. The research results disclosed that the management form plays a significant role, especially in such agrocoenoses, in which the same crop is cultivated for several years (e.g. sites with alfalfa or permanent lawn), i.e., on the sites without ploughing or other similar agrotechnical measures. In these cases, the sites with the sustainable agro-environmental scheme had higher species richness (8 and 9 species) and higher total abundance of millipede communities (2.2 and 5.7 ind. collected per one day and one trap) than the sites with the conventional form of agrotechnical management (5 and 5 species, 0.09 and 0.3 ind. collected per one day and one trap). In order to obtain a more detailed knowledge about the impact of agricultural management forms on millipede communities, this kind of research should be carried out in different conditions (other crops, soil conditions, climate zones, etc.) as well.","[Stasiov, Slavomir; Hazuchova, Lenka; Svitok, Marek] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, Dept Biol & Gen Ecol, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; [Vician, Vladimir; Kocik, Karol] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, Dept Landscape Planning & Design, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen; Technical University Zvolen,"Stasiov, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, Dept Biol & Gen Ecol, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",stasiov@tuzvo.sk,"Svitok, Marek/A-4843-2013; Staiov, Slavomír/ABD-9909-2021","Svitok, Marek/0000-0003-2710-8102;",Slovak grant agency VEGA [1/0551/11]; KEGA [011TU Z-4/2011],Slovak grant agency VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); KEGA,"Our thanks are due to B.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the peasant household credit investigation system in Hubei RCCs and provide some evidence and ideas to the formulation of relevant policies. Design/methodology/approach - First, this paper briefly reviews the related literature of the efficiency in credit investigation system; second, the paper gives a brief description of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and designs the indicators for efficiency evaluation; third, the paper accounts data sources and processing methods; and finally, the paper performs the empirical analysis and draws a conclusion. Findings - The paper finds that the efficiency of the resource allocation in both regions is unoptimistic, the general efficiency is somewhat low, and it shows the trend of declination. The efficiency of pure technology in two regions represents the adverse trend. Every year's average scale efficiency in both regions is higher than the pure technology efficiency. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper include the first use of DEA model to practically evaluate the efficiency of credit investigation system based on 54 samples of RCCs in Hubei Province and the horizontal and vertical comparisons of the results. The conclusions of this paper not only make the efficiency of credit investigation system in the province's 54 credit cooperatives comparable but also has a great application value to the. actual decision-making departments in formulating credit policies, and each credit cooperative in further building the credit investigation system according to its own conditions. Moreover, it has certain reference value to other similar studies.","[Xiong, Xueping; Tian, Jie] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Hongxin] Peoples Bank China, Financial Res Dept, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; People's Bank of China,"Xiong, XP (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",xxp@mail.hzau.edu.in,,,,,,,19,0,2,3,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called One Farm Household, Two Production Systems (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years. This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for Tamers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow Green Food are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides.","[Zhang, Man; Jin, Yanhong] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, 88 Lipman Dr, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Zhang, Man; Qiao, Hui; Zheng, Fengtian] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Renmin University of China,"Zheng, FT (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",yanhong.Jin@Rutgers.edu; qiaohui@ruc.edu.cn; zft@ruc.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Man/0000-0001-9600-904X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473256],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Fengtian Zheng acknowledges the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project ID: 71473256).,,47,25,27,4,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Yield estimation is key for predicting stock volumes, avoiding stock ruptures and planning harvesting operations. Visual yield estimations have traditionally been employed, resulting in inaccurate and misleading information. The main goal of this study was to develop an automated image processing methodology to detect, count and estimate the size of citrus fruits on individual trees using deep learning techniques. During 3 consecutive annual campaigns, a total of 20 trees from a commercial citrus grove were monitored using images captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). These trees were harvested manually, and fruit sizes were measured. A Faster R-CNN Deep Learning model was trained using a custom dataset to detect oranges in the obtained images. An average standard error (SE) of 6.59 % was obtained between visual counting and the model's fruit detection. Using the detected fruits, fruit size estimation was also performed. The promising results obtained indicate that this size estimation method can be employed for size discrimination prior to harvest. A model based on Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) was trained for yield estimation per tree and for a total yield estimation. The actual and estimated yields per tree were compared, resulting in an approximate error of SE = 4.53 % and a standard deviation of SD = 0.97 Kg. The actual total yield, the estimated total yield and the total yield estimated by an expert technician were compared. The error in the estimation by the technician was SE = 13.74 %, while the errors in the model were SE = 7.22 % and SD = 4083.58 Kg. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the present technique to provide yield estimates for citrus fruits or even other types of fruit.","[Apolo-Apolo, O.

Yet recent trends toward freelancing and technological connectivity make scope economies especially timely in addressing structural challenges to artist-led incubators. This paper offers a conceptual framework for cooperative strategies that employ economies of scope both in the economic sense of joint production and in the financial sense of risk pooling. This framework distinguishes franchise, federation, and resource-sharing organizational structures as developed through case studies of two US-based organizations: ArtBuilt and REC (Resources for Every Creator), placed in a larger context of cooperative organizational strategy in the USA and Europe. The proposed strategies of cooperative networks (quasi-franchises, federations, or resource-sharing networks) also draw on a literature of spatial agglomeration in creative industries. The framework leads to more speculative ideas of balance-sheet philanthropy through credit backstopping by foundations, and of novel investment trusts that can be piloted across a range organizations including foundations, grant-makers, artist residency programs, and even for-profit companies engaged in reinsurance. The paper contributes managerial tools and strategies for the creative engagement of capacity building in arts organizations.","[Whitaker, Amy] NYU, Steinhardt Sch, Visual Arts Adm, Dept Art & Art Profess, 34 Stuyvesant St, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Whitaker, A (corresponding author), NYU, Steinhardt Sch, Visual Arts Adm, Dept Art & Art Profess, 34 Stuyvesant St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",amy.whitaker@nyu.edu,,"Whitaker, Amy/0000-0002-5089-5370",,,,,67,3,3,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Eastern Germany has a special advantage in producing bioenergy crops: the former agricultural cooperatives built up quite large farms with, compared to Western Germany, comparatively large fields. Therefore, a modelling study of the potential and the impacts of aspen SRC plantations in the five eastern federal states of Germany under the recent climate and future climate projections was conducted. The ecophysiological forest growth model 4C was used to simulate the growth of aspen SRC plantations and their impacts on carbon in soils, and groundwater recharge, on selected suitable areas currently under crops but with marginal site conditions for cropping. A clear signal to enhanced growth condition over the whole area can be seen in the simulation of the mean annual woody biomass yield under conditions of climate change, which increased from 7.47 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate to 9.26 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) at the end of the considered future period 2034-2055 under climate change. The mean soil carbon sequestration rate was 0.81 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate and could rise up to 0.93 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the assumption of climate change. On the other hand, the mean annual percolation rate, used as an indicator of impacts on the regional water budget, will diminish under future climatic conditions. The results suggest that aspen SRC plantations are a suitable contribution to regional CO2 mitigation and carbon sequestration under possible change of climate, but that negative impacts on the regional water budget are possible.","[Lasch, Petra; Kollas, Chris; Rock, Joachim; Suckow, Felicitas] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Lasch, P (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A 62, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",Petra.Lasch@pik-potsdam.de,"Rock, Joachim/S-5727-2016","Rock, Joachim/0000-0001-5773-8995; Suckow, Felicitas/0000-0002-2566-7069; Lasch-Born, Petra/0000-0001-6468-4411",BVVG (Bodenverwertungs- und verwaltungs GmbH),BVVG (Bodenverwertungs- und verwaltungs GmbH),"This work was partly funded by the BVVG (Bodenverwertungs- und verwaltungs GmbH).

In the centers of financial power in both the United States and the United Kingdom, proposals now circulate to give workers and the public more say over how flows of credit are allocated. This article examines five democratization proposals: credit union franchises, public investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, inclusive ownership funds, and bank nationalization. It considers how these plans might activate worker and public engagement in decision making about finance by focusing on three modes of public participation: representative democracy, direct democracy, and deliberative minipublics. It then considers the degree to which democratization plans might be resilient to de-democratization threats from business. It argues that of the five, bank nationalization goes furthest in guarding against de-democratization threats but is still pocked with pitfalls if it relies solely on representative democracy. It argues that two criteria appear necessary for democratically durable alternatives: the active direct participation of workers and citizens and the weakening of businesses' capacity for democratic retrenchment.","[McCarthy, Michael A.] Marquette Univ, Sociol, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Marquette University,"McCarthy, MA (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, Social & Cultural Sci, Lalumiere Hall 340,1310 W Clybourn St, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",michael.mccarthy@marquette.edu,,,,,,,63,11,11,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0032-3292,1552-7514,,POLIT SOC,Polit.

The relevance of this scientific problem is that support of small-scale farming in Ukraine is very important for the social and economic development of the country. To develop optimal marketing and management policies for rural farmers, it is necessary to determine the challenges arise in Ukrainian small-scale farming towards its path to economic development. In order to determine important factors for small Ukrainian farmers, 120 small-scale farmers from Dnipropetrovs'k region involved in dairy, honey and vegetable production were surveyed. Among the respondents there were men and women aged 23-64, having a farm, family farm or a personal peasant household. Farmers were asked to name 3 challenges that matter, and indicate the strength of their influence (weak, average or strong). In addition, 10 personal interviews with farmers were conducted in order to find out more details about the responses in the questionnaires. The study identified two major groups of challenges for small-scale Ukrainian farmers. They are challenges in production process and marketing. The study showed that in order to manage these challenges and support the development of small-scale farming in Ukraine, the following recommendations can be made: farmers need to participate actively in the development of their own community and local production; cooperation has proved successful for dairy, vegetable, berries and cereals producers; it is necessary to keep on supporting the decentralization policy in small communities; it is necessary to ensure the protection of the small-scale farmers' rights after abolition of the moratorium on the land sale, and at the same time, to control the use of these lands; it is important to choose agricultural systems safer for land and water, than the traditional system of agriculture in Ukraine; it is important for farmers to pay attention to their managerial qualities and upgrade them through constant education and training; local community leaders need to strengthen support for rural youth in order to reduce their migration to major cities. The results of the research can be useful for small-scale farmers, rural community leaders and agricultural cooperatives' members.","[Bezus, Roman] Dnipro State Agr & Econ Univ, 25 S Efremova, UA-49600 Dnipro, Ukraine; [Samofal, Olena] Natl Met Acad Ukraine, 4 Gagarin Ave, UA-49600 Dnipro, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Dnipro State Agrarian and Economic University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ukrainian State University of Science & Technologies,"Bezus, R (corresponding author), Dnipro State Agr & Econ Univ, 25 S Efremova, UA-49600 Dnipro, Ukraine.",bezus.r.m@dsau.dp.ua; sev5@ukr.net,"BEZUS, Roman/AAL-6690-2021","BEZUS, Roman/0000-0001-5284-9178",,,,,16,2,2,1,14,UNIV AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES & VETERINARY MEDICINE BUCHAREST,BUCHAREST,"59 MARASTI BOULEVARD, DISTRICT 1, BUCHAREST, 011464, ROMANIA",2285-5718,2286-0126,,AGROLIFE SCI J,AgroLife Sci.

Based on 101 field questionnaires of rural households in Lankao County and the monitoring data on heavy metal of arable soil of each rural household, the kind of rural households' behaviors which impose obvious influence on heavy metal content of arable soil are investigated via single-factor pollution index, Nemerow pollution index and econometric model in this study. The results show that, rural households' land utilization mode affects heavy metal content in soil, e.g., the degree of heavy metal pollution of soil for intensive planting is higher than that of traditional planting, viz. vegetable greenhouse > garlic land > traditional crop farmland. The management of cultivated land with due scale is beneficial to reducing heavy metal content in soil, that is, the land fragmentation degree is in direct proportion to heavy metal content in soil, so rural households are encouraged to carry out land circulation and combine the patch into a large one. Excess application of fertilizer, pesticide and organic fertilizer will lead to heavy metal pollution of soil, while agricultural technical training organized by government department and the foundation of agricultural cooperative can promote the technical level and degree of organization of rural households and enable them to be more scientific and rational in agrochemicals selection and application, hence reducing or avoiding heavy metal pollution of soil. Single factor pollution level of heavy metal in the soil for planting various crops is different, so it is recommended to prepare various pollution reduction programs for different land types and pollution levels for the harmony and unity of human-nature system.","[Ren, Shixin; Li, Erling; Deng, Qingqing; He, Haishan; Li, Sijie] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Agr & Rural Sustainable Dev Res Inst, Key Res Inst Yellow River Civilizat & Sustainable, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Ren, Shixin; Li, Erling; Deng, Qingqing; He, Haishan; Li, Sijie] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Agr & Rural Sustainable Dev Res Inst, Henan Collaborat Innovat Ctr Yellow River Civiliz, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Li, Erling] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Urban Rural Coordinated De, Academician Lab Urban & Rural Spatial Data Mi, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China",Henan University; Henan University,"Li, EL (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Agr & Rural Sustainable Dev Res Inst, Key Res Inst Yellow River Civilizat & Sustainable, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.;Li, EL (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Agr & Rural Sustainable Dev Res Inst, Henan Collaborat Innovat Ctr Yellow River Civiliz, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.;Li, EL (corresponding author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr Urban Rural Coordinated De, Academician Lab Urban & Rural Spatial Data Mi, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.",sxren@vip.henu.edu.cn; erlingli@henu.edu.cn; dqq0801@126.com; seamountainriver@163.com; 18739992308@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471105, 41430637]; Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province [182300410144]; Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Henan Province [16IRTSTHN012]; Key Project of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Base in Ministry of Education [15JJDZONGHE008]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province; Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Henan Province; Key Project of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Base in Ministry of Education,"This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41471105, 41430637), Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (182300410144), Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Henan Province (16IRTSTHN012) and Key Project of the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Base in Ministry of Education (15JJDZONGHE008).",,52,10,11,6,51,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4368,10.3390/su10124368,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124368,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HG9OL,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000455338100034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cooperatives are a particularly viable organizational structure for these projects since Indigenous foodsystems historically depended on community cooperation and collective use of land and other resources. This paper is interested in the ways Native foodway initiatives are building producer cooperatives in the US as a method towards food sovereignty. To do so, authors conducted interviews, attended food sovereignty gatherings, and reviewed relevant literature to offer historical context, a theoretical framework for Indigenous food sovereignty producer cooperatives, and four Native-led food producer cooperative case studies that are working to increase access to fresh, local foods produced in accordance with the beliefs, behaviors, processes, and worldviews of their particular communities. The organizational structure and purpose of the four cooperatives differs, but they are united in a common commitment to stewarding the interspecies relationships foundational to Indigenous foodways. In doing so, these cooperatives are also expanding who, or what, counts as a member. We argue this offers a compelling model for ecologically and culturally integrated cooperative development in individual communities and a platform for (re)establishing foodways and trade relationships between Native Nations.","[Dower, Becca; Gaddis, Jennifer] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Human Ecol, 1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Dower, B (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Human Ecol, 1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",rdower@wisc.edu; jgaddis@wisc.edu,,", Becca/0000-0002-0363-950X; Gaddis, Jennifer/0000-0002-4705-7528",University of Wisconsin -Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research,University of Wisconsin -Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research,Support for this research was provided by the University of Wisconsin -Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research,,94,1,1,1,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

Thus, the study aims to identify some strategic enabling cooperatives to increase its revenue and result. Through simulations, the study also shows the effects on income if the suggested strategies are implemented and projections prove accurate. The relevance of this study is justified by the growing importance of costs in decision-making organizations, as well as the difficulty that shops belonging to cooperatives face to increase its turnover due to the restriction of the market. The methodology used in this project is the case study, considering the processes related to a cooperative, showing variable costs, contribution margin and market potential. The results of the study, it appears that the cooperative can increase by 64% its sales to farmers cooperatives that supply milk, if kept the relationship shown between the cooperative and ten associates evaluated. Based on simulations, considering projections of changes in price and variations of quantities sold, the cooperative can achieve an increase of 16.02% in revenue and an increase of 30.47% in the total contribution margin.","[Eckert, Alex; Mecca, Marlei Salete; Biasio, Roberto; Sassi, Eder] Univ Caxias do Sul, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Eckert, A (corresponding author), Univ Caxias do Sul, R Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil.",alex.eckert@bol.com.br; msmecca@ucs.br; rbiasio@commcenter-rs.com.br; edersassi@yahoo.com.br,"Mecca, Marlei S/V-5134-2017; Eckert, Alex/F-7165-2012","Mecca, Marlei S/0000-0001-7545-3184; Eckert, Alex/0000-0002-8704-9549",,,,,13,2,2,1,17,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2013,9,2,,,,,188,209,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,251VH,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000326958800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The structural equation modelling technique was employed to seek answer for the question of how value chain integration dimensions are related to performance. The results of the analyses showed the existence of positive relationships between coordination of activities and performance; between joint decision-making and performance at farmers-cooperatives interface; and between commitment towards long-term relationships and performance at farmers-traders interface. The study has made important empirical contributions in areas of value chain integration and performance and their interplays within the context of the studied malt barley value chain. The key findings of the study make important policy implications for agribusiness value chains in the developing countries.

The intensive use of pollutants in fields near ecological coastal wetlands has led to implementation of pesticide monitoring programs to recover aquatic systems such as the Mondego estuary (Figueira da Foz, Portugal). According to information from the agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley, Primextra(R) Gold TZ is the most-used herbicide in corn crop fields. Biomarkers, such fatty acids (FAs), proved to be new and potentially powerful tools to detect, illustrate, and evaluate exposure to and the effects of contamination hazards. They play important roles in establishing neural levels in organisms' biochemical and physiological responses and are considered good bio-indicators of stress and potential indicators of ecosystem health. Bivalves are currently used in ecotoxicological bioassays because of their ecological importance, wide geographic distribution, ease of handling in the laboratory and in the field, and their ability to filter and ingest large volumes of water and sediment particles. Thus, the main goal of this work was to determine the toxic and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) responses of two size classes (small and big) of the two marine bivalve species Cerastoderma edule and Scrobicularia plane to the herbicide Primextra Gold. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the fatty acid contents, and thus the nutritive values, of both species and size classes collected in the field with those under laboratory conditions. Results show S. plana is more sensitive to the herbicide than C edule. In general, among the larger-sized specimens in the field, S. plum is more nutritive than C. edule, but among the smaller-sized specimens, the opposite tendency is seen, where C. edule presents a greater abundance of FAs.

This paper aims to propose the combined use of credit scoring and profit scoring to increase the effectiveness of the loan-granting process in credit unions. Design/methodology/approach - This sample is composed by the data of personal loans transactions of a Brazilian credit union. Findings - The analysis reveals that the use of statistical methods improves significantly the predictability of default when compared to the use of subjective techniques and the superiority of the random forests model in estimating credit scoring and profit scoring when compared to logit and ordinary least squares method (OLS) regression. The study also illustrates how both analyses can be used jointly for more effective daision-making. Originality/value - Replacing subjective analysis with objective credit analysis using deterministic models will benefit Brazilian credit unions. The credit decision will be based on the input variables and on clear criteria, turning the decision-making process impartial. The joint use of credit scoring and profit scoring allows granting credit for the clients with the highest potential to pay debt obligation and, at the same time, to certify that the transaction profitability meets the goals of the organization: to be sustainable and to provide loans and investment opportunities at attractive rates to members.","[Vasconcellos de Paula, Daniel Abreu; Artes, Rinaldo; Ayres, Fabio; Accioly Fonseca Minardi, Andrea Maria] Insper, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Insper,"de Paula, DAV (corresponding author), Insper, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",dequiosp@hotmail.com,"Artes, Rinaldo/D-2914-2013","Artes, Rinaldo/0000-0001-6354-0846",,,,,37,5,6,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2531-0488,,,RAUSP MANAG J,RAUSP Manag.

It presented a conceptual framework with integrated risk supply chain and knowledge base systems. The critical point of dairy located on the product which has the characteristic easy damage. Risk-damaged dairy contaminated with bacteria due to improper handling of dairy. Risk occurred in each activity in the supply chain network ranging from farmer, cooperative and dairy processing industry. The structured approach of supply chain risk divided into the phases of risk identification, risk measurement and risk assessment, risk evaluation and risk mitigation and contingency plans; and risk control and monitoring system based on knowledge base system. Adding Knowledge base component to risk supply chain will produce the following process: knowledge base risk capture, knowledge base risk discovery, knowledge base risk examination, knowledge base risk sharing, knowledge base risk evaluation and knowledge base risk repository. The relationship between risk factor, risks and their consequences are represented on Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FNMA) and Hierarchical Risk Breakdown Structure (HRBS).

Consequently, agricultural production activities cause various environmental issues. Carrying out safe production provides vital support for sustainable development of agriculture, which may improve this situation. The past decades have witnessed the fast development of rural cooperatives organization in China. Given the fact that rural cooperative organization plays a crucial role in agricultural production, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative membership and safe production of smallholders in China. This study aims to investigate whether the participation in farmer cooperatives contributes to safe production in agriculture in China. Using survey data covering 623 rice-producing farm households in Sichuan province in China, this study employs the endogenous switching regression model to examine the effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. The results show that cooperative membership has significantly positive effects on safe production in rice agriculture. In particular, the average treatment effects demonstrate that without the participation in cooperatives, the members' adoption of the green control techniques would reduce by 74.491%, the application of artificial weeding would reduce by 38.768%, and organic fertilizer input would reduce by 23.448%. Furthermore, the marginal treatment effect is employed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. Heterogeneous effect analyses suggest that farmers who are more likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt green control technology, while farmers who are less likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt artificial weeding and increase organic fertilizer input. To improve safe production in rice agriculture, the Chinese government is expected to encourage rice farmers to participate in rural cooperative organizations, and to stimulate rice farmers to take collective action to address environment issues arising from agricultural production.","[Li, Houjian; Liu, Yu; Zhao, Xuemei] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lichen] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Kaihua] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Coll Econ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Chongqing University; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Yuan, KH (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Coll Econ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",casparyuan@126.com,,"Li, Houjian/0000-0003-4852-8042",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603177]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2722020JCT003]; Chinese National Research of Social Sciences [20CJL026],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Chinese National Research of Social Sciences,"This study was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China with ratification number 71603177, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2722020JCT003), and the Chinese National Research of Social Sciences (20CJL026).",,90,23,23,10,62,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Producers seeking broader marketing opportunities often turn to co-ops. This study examines how, within alternative food networks (AFNs), co-ops play a role in the emergence of the Domestic Fair Trade (DFT) movement in the USA. The DFT movement is based on the idea that family farms and small-to mid-sized farms in the global north are facing many of the same pressures as producers in the global south. The Domestic Fair Trade Association (DFTA) in the USA is the umbrella organization for a variety of stakeholders. The DFTA seeks to 'support family-scale farming, to reinforce farmer-led initiatives such as farmer co-operatives, and to bring these groups together with mission-based traders, retailers and concerned consumers to contribute to the movement for sustainable agriculture in North America'(1). This study assessed five co-ops (through interviews and document analysis) to determine their experiences with integrating DFT into their business practices. The research reveals that DFT concepts are important to co-operative decision-makers, but they are faced with challenges when it comes to actually integrating DFT into their business model. Insight into stakeholder perceptions and professional-level DFT activities, indicates that co-ops will be a key factor in determining whether the DFT movement will succeed in the USA.","[Duram, Leslie] So Illinois Univ, Dept Geog, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Mead, Amber] CDMSmith Environm Consulting, Denver, CO 80202 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Duram, L (corresponding author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Geog, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",duram@siu.edu,,"Duram, Leslie/0000-0003-1133-1000",,,,,53,1,1,0,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1742-1705,1742-1713,,RENEW AGR FOOD SYST,Renew.

The comparison is based on calculations in a linear programming (LP) farm model supported with Stochastic Dominance with Respect to a Function (SDRF) for risk analysis. Mountain dairy farming involves free ranging cows on natural pastures for about 70 days. The contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, CLA and various antioxidants in the milk increase when cows graze alpine pastures affecting its processing properties, and flavor and chemical content of dairy products. Seasonal mountain cheese production is found to be generally preferable to the other alternatives for risk neutral as well as risk-averse decision makers. This is due to a higher price for mountain products, subsidy payments for mountain farming, and exemption for farm processed milk in the national milk quota. The risks are partly price risks but also yield and output risks as well as downside political risks since the profitability depend strongly on subsidies and premiums, and exemption for farm-processed milk in the milk quota. Investments in farming co-operatives were unprofitable due to less subsidy payments compared to individual farmers. Effects of calving time, introducing fertilized pastures or night pens, and supplementary feeding to extend the mountain period and sustain milk yields are examined. The premium price for mountain products, animal welfare, and farmer co-operation on marketing are discussed.","[Asheim, Leif Jarle] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, N-0030 Oslo, Norway; [Lunnan, Tor; Sickel, Hanne] Bioforsk, Heggenes, Norway",Bioforsk,"Asheim, LJ (corresponding author), Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, POB 8024, N-0030 Oslo, Norway.",Leif-Jarle.Asheim@nilf.no,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,5,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

We explored farm-level opportunities, constraints and trade-offs for climbing bean cultivation in the eastern highlands of Uganda. We established current food self-sufficiency, income, investment costs and labour, and assessed the ex-ante, farm-level impact of four climbing bean options on these indicators. Input for this assessment were a detailed characterization of 16 farms of four types, and on-farm, experimental data of adaptation trials of climbing bean. Climbing beans generally improved food self-sufficiency and income, but often required increased financial investment and always demanded more labour than current farm configurations. Opportunities for integration of climbing beans on small farms were limited. Although some of the poorest farmers accrued the largest absolute benefits from climbing beans, their ability to make the necessary investments is questionable. The analysis was translated into a simple-to-use modelling tool to enable participatory analysis of the outcomes with farmers of the four farm types to understand their perspectives and decision-making. The discussions revealed a recent increase in market prices for climbing bean resulting in growing interest in their cultivation in the eastern highlands. A lack of seed and stakes was limiting climbing bean cultivation, and a sufficient amount of climbing bean seed needs to be ensured through strengthening of farmer cooperatives and improved storage.","[Ronner, E.; Descheemaeker, K.; Marinus, W.; Giller, K.

This study, through a study of 241 farm households in 10 national tourism poverty alleviation key villages in the Qinba Mountain region of Hanzhong, southern Shaanxi, finds that rural tourism has contributed to a general increase in farm household income, but the effect of income increase varies significantly between households that have escaped poverty and non-poor households, and there is no significant difference in income between those who participate in tourism and those who do not. The study concludes that the poverty-reducing effects of tourism are conditional, with the poor quality of human capital being the main obstacle to farm households' income growth, the institutional mechanism for tourism participation is inadequate, effective farm household tourism participation is significantly low, and non-farm work constitutes a substitute for farm households' tourism livelihood options. The primary stage tourism scenic spots have a limited role in driving the income of farming households, and the geographical location limits the effective participation of farming households. Accordingly, the following countermeasures are proposed: (1) in terms of strategic decision-making options, establish a screening mechanism for tourism participation in poverty alleviation and implement diversified poverty governance; (2) in terms of tourism development strategies, encourage the integration of multiple industries and synergistic development, realize the two-way interaction of + tourism and tourism +; (3) in terms of development methods, adhere to the participatory development path, improve the institutional mechanism for tourism participation, stimulate the endogenous motivation of farmers, and explore the dynamic participation path of bottom-up.

However, the resources and competencies required to implement such an integrated strategy at the level of the individual, the organization, and the sector are not known. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed an approach to analyze responses of organizations to environmental change and evolving social demands for biodiversity conservation. We analyze the scale, scope, and distribution of the resources and competencies that support the delineation of ecologically significant habitats in intensively managed nonindustrial private forests in Finland, an important international actor in the sector. Based on a national survey of 311 foresters working in public agencies, private firms, and cooperative organizations, we investigate the division of labor in the sector and the patterns of investment in human capital, organizational resources, and information networks that support delineation. We find that communicating frequently with the actors who are directly engaged in field operations is consistently the most productive resource in conserving habitats. Our analysis identifies differences in competencies among different types of organizations, as well as distinct roles for public and private-sector organizations. Beyond identification of differences in conservation behavior and competencies among organizations, our analysis points to substantial uniformity in the sector. We attribute similarities in patterns of investment in conservation resources to historically structured central coordination mechanisms within the sector that include education, training, and broadly shared professional norms. These institutional structures and the resulting uniformity can be potential impediments to radical innovation. Our approach to analyzing adaptation to environmental change highlights the interplay between investments in competencies by actors within a particular technical domain and the evolving external institutional environment.","[Primmer, Eeva] Cornell Univ, Finnish Environm Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Wolf, Steven A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Primmer, E (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Finnish Environm Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,"Primmer, Eeva/0000-0001-8954-8205","Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation; Academy of Finland [206020]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [206020, 206020] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"We wish to thank Mikael Hilden, Heimo Karppinen, Jari Kuuluvainen, Aija Leiponen, Per Mickwitz, Heli Saarikoski, and Patrick Sullivan as well as two anonymous reviewers for ideas and useful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

Nonetheless, efficient farm practices can enhance productivity, farmers' profit, and the price and quality of marketed rice. This study analyzed the profitability and efficiency of rice production in the Ayeyarwaddy Region of Myanmar and identified the influencing socioeconomic characteristics and farm-specific characteristics. Primary data from 130 randomly sampled farmers in the Ayeyarwaddy Region were collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and Tobit regression analysis. According to the average overall technical efficiency, farmers have an additional rice yield potential of 25 percent that can be attained by improving input utilization. The best practices benchmarked in the region showed that technical inefficiency is caused by excessive use of inputs, especially herbicides and animal power. Most rice farms in this study suffer from allocative and economic inefficiencies resulting from wrong combinations of input usages. The average economic efficiency level indicates that farmers can increase their profitability by 57 percent if they adapted to reduce input costs. Moreover, efficiency was significantly higher for farmers who were younger, better educated, more experienced, had access to agricultural extension services, and cultivated the Aye Yar Min variety. Efficiency can be improved by setting up farmers' cooperatives to increase the scale of operations. Moreover, the government should intervene to reduce input prices, control the quality of input seeds, and install an appropriate financial crop insurance mechanism. Effective and systematic agricultural extension services should be widespread to improve the efficiency and decision-making skills of rice farmers in the study area.","[Linn, Thuzar] Yezin Agr Univ, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar; [Maenhout, Broos] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Linn, T (corresponding author), Yezin Agr Univ, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar.",thuzarlinn.eco@gmail.com; broos.maenhout@ugent.be,"Maenhout, Broos/AAC-1684-2021","Maenhout, Broos/0000-0001-6685-3469",,,,,55,4,4,1,9,SOUTHEAST ASIAN REGIONAL CENTER GRADUATE STUDY & RESEARCH AGRICULTURE,LAGUNA,"UPLB CAMPUS, LOS BANOS, LAGUNA, 00000, PHILIPPINES",1656-4383,,,ASIAN J AGRIC DEV,Asian J.

Commentators suggested that co-operatives, in particular credit unions, could provide accountability and sustainability through their open governance and mutual status. However, such suggestions assumed that co-operative principles and practice continued to underpin the efficacy of co-operative banking, and that credit unions, one of the most prevalent forms of co-operative banking, could offer a viable financial alternative. Instead, in the case of Cyprus, the financial crisis and the associated aftershocks triggered the nationalisation and demutualisation of credit unions. This prompted the researchers to question both the viability of a co-operative banking future and the extent to which co-operative principles were shaping decision making, governance, accountability and sustainability. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was adopted to explore the degree to which co-operative principles still shaped credit union thinking and stakeholder relationships. Findings As is the case elsewhere within the co-operative movement, the findings point the fact that governance is weaken by the low membership participation and that the principles are no longer universally applied. Credit unions, if not co-operative banking, may not offer the financial assurances that commentators have called for.

The increased popularity of entrepreneurship education toward the end of the twentieth century in many European welfare states is usually associated with a shift toward neoliberal, market-oriented, policies. It is argued here that an important reason for young entrepreneurship's success was its ability to connect with the Swedish tradition of cooperation and democratic decision making, in combination with values such as individualism and competition. A case in point is the surprising compatibility between progressive pedagogical ideas and neoliberal entrepreneurialism. The article is based on a study of Ung Foretagsamhet (Young Entrepreneurship, henceforth UF), the Swedish version of the American organization Junior Achievement, and the ambition of the consumer cooperative movement's think tank, Koopi, to offer a different kind of entrepreneurship education. In the analysis, the concept of the entrepreneurial self is applied to these two different programs, and the results show how they clashed, but also overlapped, in ways that help explain the success of UF. The article is a contribution to our understanding of how entrepreneurship discourse emerged and manifested itself in everyday environments in the late twentieth century, and as such also contributes to the history of Nordic neoliberalism.","[Rudberg, Elin Astrom] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Uppsala, Sweden; [Rudberg, Elin Astrom] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist & Int Relat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Uppsala University; Stockholm University,"Rudberg, EÅ (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Uppsala, Sweden.;Rudberg, EÅ (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist & Int Relat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Åström Rudberg, Elin/HSG-6791-2023","Astrom Rudberg, Elin/0000-0001-6774-6593",Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [P2013-144:1],Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse,"I want to thank participants in the higher seminar in economic history at Uppsala University, Stockholm University, Stockholm School of Economics, the Neoliberalism in the Nordics Research Programme, and three anonymous reviewers and the editor for helpful and constructive comments to earlier versions of this article.

Design/methodology/approach - The research approach is empirical and descriptive. Data were gathered by mail survey from Finnish software producers. Findings - Networked firms intended to improve profitability by boosting resource efficiency, while non-networked firms concentrated on price increases. No difference occurred in firms' perceptions of their profitability. Networked firms intended to grow by mergers and acquisitions and by cooperation with partners. Non-networked firms were eager to grow by developing new software products. Networked firms intended to increase information sharing more and were more open in sharing information concerning firms' technical competencies, cost, and commitments to other organizations. Lack of marketing resources was the most important reason for firms to join a network. Research limitations/implications - The research setting (how the firms are classified in groups, for example) could benefit from deeper analysis of how network characteristics are connected and which variables best estimate and describe the degree of networking of a firm. A larger sample of firms should be covered to achieve generalizable results. Systematic comparison of industries would also provide essential information on network dynamics.

We posit that whether that package of information is evaluated by itself-in separate evaluation (SE)-or side by side with another package-in joint evaluation (JE)-matters. Across a variety of contexts, four studies show that people average in SE and add in JE. Consequently, mildly favorable information hurts evaluations in SE but helps in JE. Study 1 demonstrated this adding-and-averaging effect among persons with expertise: law professors judging law faculty candidates. Adding middle tier academic publications to a higher tier publication on a CV decreased evaluations of a candidate judged in SE but increased evaluations of the same candidate in JE. Study 3 examined a linear pattern prediction, showing that each piece of mildly favorable information linearly added to the overall impression of a package of information in JE but linearly detracted from evaluations of the identical target in SE. Finally, Study 4 traced these differences in evaluative judgments to a shift in reference points brought about by evaluation mode.

It is also a key element in the management of cropping systems by farmers. Therefore, cropping system design entails the understanding and evaluation of farmers' fertilisation practices. Biophysical models describing the soil-plant system can serve this purpose. A comparison between model outputs and farmers' practices was made of a set of 128 apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) plots from 31 members of a farmers' co-operative in south-eastern, France. Farmers' fertilisation practices were compared with theoretical practices generated by a series of soil-plant system models of increasing complexity, each model giving the amount of nitrogen that should be applied to the plot according to the knowledge, included in the model. The model that reproduced farmers' fertilisation practices most closely was the most complex, taking all plant requirements, soil organic matter and residue mineralisation, denitrification and irrigation supply into account. A Monte Carlo method showed that the differences between farmers' practices and model outputs were not random. Spatial analysis showed a strong spatial organisation of these differences, mainly due to three farms. This congruence between farmers' practices and model outputs suggests the existence of some indicators that depict the N nutrition status of the orchard as a basis for rules indicating how much nitrogen should be applied. The spatial analysis suggests the existence of farmer and neighbourhood effects, which need to be explained. Models appear to be useful tools to study farmers' practices by removing biophysical effects (soil, variety, etc.).. This raises new questions concerning agricultural research at the interface between the biophysical and social sciences. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the education and training resources in the, country needed to be brought into the development program at the outset. In addition, the various government agencies responsible for economic development also had a major role to play in achieving a successful outcome. Other nations were equally concerned about their garment industries as well. This project examined what in any other countries in the region, the U.S., and European countries were doing. The resolution evolved around the three sectors setting up a cooperative organization of partners that maintained the independence of each sector while encouraging cooperation where their interests were in common.

In the special case of credit granting organizations, it is important to clearly define rejection/approval criteria. In this direction, classification rules are an appropriate tool, provided that the rule set has low cardinality and that the antecedent of the rules has few conditions. This paper analyzes different solutions based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques, which are able to construct a set of classification rules with the aforementioned characteristics using information from the borrower and the macroeconomic environment at the time of granting the loan. In addition, to facilitate the understanding of the model, fuzzy logic is incorporated into the construction of the antecedent. To reduce the search time, the particle swarm is initialized by a competitive neural network. Different variants of PSO are applied to three databases of financial institutions in Ecuador.

The purpose of this study was a theoretical and methodological generalization of the agroholdings' social initiatives within their charitable activities with the interaction of cooperatives based on the institutional model. Methodology / approach. This study was based on applying the general economic and special methods. The abstract-logical method was used for scientific discussion and scientific views about the role of agroholdings and their impact on the rural population. The method of critical analysis was applied to outline the social aspects of agroholdings' activities. The system approach allowed contouring the main problems that arise in the process of agroholding growing. The study of the state of agricultural cooperatives' financing by agroholdings was also conducted. On the basis of the monographic method the motives and directions of the management of separate agroholdings within their social responsibility limits were defined. With the generalization method, the basic forms and resources of agroholdings' social responsibility were determined. Thanks to the correlation-regression analysis, it was established the relationship between the social responsibility indicator of agroholdings and their efficiency by EBITDA, as well as their social responsibility and market capitalization degree. Results. The study examined the main scientific approaches to the role of agroholdings, which allowed outlining their ambiguity and contradictions. The systematization of the presented materials allowed developing arguments in favor of the agroholdings' functioning and identifying counterarguments of their activities as well as emphasizing the need of the basic methodological provisions for further harmonious development of agroholding structures and cooperatives. The results of the presented empirical analysis showed a low level of agroholdings' social responsibility, which affects the development of the rural areas and significantly increases social tensions. On the basis of the conducted research and data processing the mechanism of agroholdings' and cooperatives' interaction on the basis of social responsibility is offered. It was proved that the basis of the presented interaction must be financial and economic, social, marketing and environmental motives. Originality / scientific novelty. It was improved the theoretical and methodological approach to the formation of institutional model of the agroholdings' and cooperatives' interaction on the principles of social responsibility, which provides financial and economic, social, marketing, environmental problems solutions by agroholdings and promotes the rural community's development in the near future. Practical value / implications. The results of the study are of great practical importance and can be useful for various ownership forms of agricultural producers as well as for agricultural holding organizations which are interested in harmonizing the rural economy development.","[Skydan, Oleh; Budnik, Olha; Sus, Lesya] Polissia Natl Univ, Zhytomyr, Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Polissia National University,"Skydan, O (corresponding author), Polissia Natl Univ, Zhytomyr, Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine.",,"Sus, Lesya/V-3185-2017; Budnik, Olga/C-1374-2018; Skydan, Oleh/V-4183-2017","Sus, Lesya/0000-0002-5862-3820; Budnik, Olga/0000-0002-6611-3310; Skydan, Oleh/0000-0003-4673-9620",,,,,30,2,2,1,6,INST EASTERN EUROPEAN RESEARCH & CONSULTING,KHARKIV,"EDUC CAMPUS KNAU, KHARKIV, UKRAINE",,2414-584X,,AGR RESOUR EC INT SC,Agric.

J,"Jin, SZ; Jia, XP; James, HS",,,,"Jin, Shaoze; Jia, Xiangping; James, Harvey S.",,,Losses because of risk attitudes or time preference: off-farm cold storage and intertemporal marketing of apple growers in China,JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,China; Supermarkets; Risk attitudes; Field experiment; Farm Bases; Time preference; Apples; Cold storage,ELICITING RISK; COOPERATIVE MEMBERSHIP; HERMETIC STORAGE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; DISCOUNT RATES; PRIOR OUTCOMES; AVERSION; CHOICE; ADOPTION; MODEL,"Purpose This paper aims to explore the relationship between prudence in risk attitudes and patience of time preference of Chinese apple growers regarding off-farm cold storage of production and marketing in non-harvest seasons. The authors also consider the effect of farmer participation in cooperative-like organizations known as Farm Bases (FBs). Design/methodology/approach The authors use multiple list methods and elicitation strategies to measure Chinese apple farmers' risk attitudes and time preferences. Because these farmers can either sell their apples immediately to supermarkets or intermediaries or place them in storage, the authors assess correlations between their storage decisions and their preferences regarding risk and time. The authors also differentiate risks involving gains and losses and empirically examine individual risk attitudes in different scenarios. Findings Marketing decisions are moderately associated with risk attitudes but not time preference. Farmers with memberships in local farmer cooperatives are likely to speculate more in cold storage. Thus, risk aversion behavioral and psychological motives affect farmers' decision-making of cold storage and intertemporal marketing activities. However, membership in cooperatives does not always result in improved income and welfare for farmers. Research limitations/implications The research confirms that behavioral factors may strongly drive vulnerable smallholder farmers to speculate into storage even under seasonal and uncertain marketing volatility. There is the need to think deeper about the rationale of promoting cooperatives and other agricultural forms, because imposing these without careful consideration can have negative impacts. Originality/value Do risk and time preferences affect the decision of farmers to utilize storage facilities? This question is important because it is not clear if and how risk preferences affect the tradeoff between consuming today and saving for tomorrow, especially for farmers in developing countries.","[Jin, Shaoze] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xiangping] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [James, Harvey S.] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agriculture Information Institute, CAAS; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia","James, HS (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",hjames@missouri.edu,,"Jin, Shaoze/0000-0001-9271-8615; James, Harvey/0000-0003-0189-271X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573209, 71661147001]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0201303]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA021]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [MO-AC011AC047]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors acknowledges funding support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (71573209; 71661147001), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0201303), National Social Science Foundation of China (16ZDA021), and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Hatch project no.

Sitajakhala Dugdha Utpadak Samabai Samiti Limited (Sitajakhala Dairy Producers Cooperative Society Limited) is a successful cooperative society in the northeastern region of India. The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how the cooperative manages its production and supply chain of milk and milk products and highlights several issues that the cooperative encountered in the recent past and how those issues were managed. This case also illustrates how an agribusiness cooperative has been growing over the years, including expansion of business and the creation of a brand image, as well as benefiting its members and their communities. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a case study approach where they went for in-person interviews of Sitajakhala's executive members and office staff; in addition, the authors were given access to Sitajakhala's marketing and financial records as well as its annual reports and vision documents. Findings Sitajakhala Co-op provides a platform where individual dairy farmers (most of who are small farmers and many of them are illiterate) can unite to bargain for higher prices for their milk. Due to its member-oriented business strategy, Sitajakhala Co-op has been growing well with active support of its members. Consistent quality control and marked improvements in labeling, bottling and packaging of milk and milk products has helped the cooperative to establish itself as a leader in dairy products supplier in Assam among bulk buyers as well as individual consumers. Sitajakhala cooperative also provides dairy farming related services to its members for free of charge to improve milk production and quality. One of the shortcomings of the cooperative is underutilization of its modern milk processing plant which needs to be addressed by the management in earnest. Research limitations/implications This case study is based on information from one dairy cooperative in Assam, India; thus, the findings of this case may not translate into other dairy cooperatives in India or elsewhere. Nonetheless, cooperative practitioners may find the findings useful from a management perspective. Social implications Sitajakhala Co-op management was keenly aware of the non-dairy related needs of the community it serves. Some of such services include free medical ambulance service for its members, supporting secondary education through providing merit and need-based scholarships and funding physical improvements to a local high school and a local college. In addition, the cooperative regularly provides funding to local sports and cultural events and local social institutions which have positive impact on the larger community. Sitajakhala cooperative has been providing employment to the local youth in the Morigaon area and plans on continuing to do so. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case study focusing on the management and operations of a dairy cooperative in the northeastern part of India. Knowledge gained from such study is expected to benefit not only Sitajakhala cooperative but also other dairy cooperatives in a similar situation. This case study will also benefit senior undergraduate and/or graduate students specializing in agricultural economics/agribusiness and can also be used for executive training for the management of academic institutions and food companies.","[Kashyap, Dipanjan] Assam Agr Univ, Jorhat, Assam, India; [Bhuyan, Sanjib] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Assam Agricultural University; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Bhuyan, S (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",bhuyan@sebs.rutgers.edu,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,"Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Assam, India; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under Government of India-World Bank funded project on National Agricultural Higher Education Project; Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA","Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Assam, India; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under Government of India-World Bank funded project on National Agricultural Higher Education Project; Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA","The authors sincerely acknowledge the Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Assam, India, and Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA, for providing both financial and material support to complete this case study while the first author was a visiting scholar at Rutgers University from November 2019 to January 2020.

This paper seeks to organize A-SMEs to develop a cooperative organization via collaborative strategies and alliance structures, named as the home-delivery-oriented agri-food supply chain (HASC) alliance, to form a substantive relationship to gain a stable foothold in the emerging e-commerce market. A theoretical framework of the HASC alliance is built with its organizational structure and schematics of the process of implementation strategies that cover the aspects of last-mile chain extension, food transportation, and production/distribution control. Furthermore, a three-step analytical method is proposed to analyze the performance of the alliance with the aim to provide appropriate strategies to hedge against the potential risks of cooperation instability. A hypothetical case is conducted, and the results show that: (1) the performance of the hypothetical HASC alliance with time shows significant variation in the beginning, but it gains stability with the application of stability control strategies; (2) the cooperation stability of HASC alliance is very sensitive to the performance of the strategies that control the customer and environment variations; (3) the factors of trust and market fluctuation have higher effects on membership and environmental stability, respectively; (4) the minimum and maximum cost ranges of control strategies at which the alliance can maintain its stability and performance are 5% and 29%, respectively, of the total operation cost.","[Han, Chunyang; Pervez, Amjad; Zhang, Dezhi] Cent South Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jingqiong] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Transportat Engn, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Shen, Xiaojing] Nanning Normal Univ, Sch Logist Management & Engn, Nanning 530001, Peoples R China",Central South University; Kunming University of Science & Technology; Nanning Normal University,"Pervez, A (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China.",sandiant@csu.edu.cn; amjadpervez04@csu.edu.cn; 20120058@kust.edu.cn; 13677323794@163.com; dzzhang@csu.edu.cn,"Han, Chunyang/HGU-4525-2022; Pervez, Amjad/AAW-4967-2020; Chunyang, Han/F-4232-2019","Pervez, Amjad/0000-0001-6283-2871; Chunyang, Han/0000-0001-9876-8824",,,,,148,6,6,1,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2020,12,16,,,,,,,6547,10.3390/su12166547,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12166547,,,34,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OC1BX,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000578899100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since the 1980s, over 3000 women-only dairy cooperative societies have been founded in Karnataka, India, with the objective of economically and socially empowering women. First we review the broader literature on gender and collective action in a development context and then empirically assess empowerment levels among fifty-eight female dairy farmers in Karnataka. We discriminate between membership and non-membership status in women-only versus mixed-gender dairy cooperatives and compare empowerment levels among those groups, borrowing categories from the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. We find that, in a context of rural poverty in which women-only cooperatives are promoted without offering additional development opportunities for men, the empowering effects remain limited to increased leadership abilities. Cooperative membership as such does not automatically enhance women's control over income or their intrahousehold decision-making power. In fact, members of women-only cooperatives perceive themselves as having even less control over dairy income and productive decisions compared with unorganized female dairy producers. These findings suggest that collective organizations in the dairy sector which systematically exclude men may fail to increase women's empowerment at the household level. At the same time, women face entry barriers to participation in mixed-gender cooperatives. We conclude that policies in support of women-only cooperatives and female members in mixed-gender cooperatives may require more rigorous evaluation.","[Dohmwirth, Carla; Hanisch, Markus] Humboldt Univ, Div Econ Agr Cooperat, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Dohmwirth, C (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Div Econ Agr Cooperat, Berlin, Germany.",carla.dohmwirth@hu-berlin.de; markus.hanisch@agrar.hu-berlin.de,,,Fiat Panis Foundation,Fiat Panis Foundation,Fiat Panis Foundation (http://www.stiftung-fiat-panis.de/).,,50,4,4,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0010-3802,1468-2656,,COMMUNITY DEV J,Community Dev.

The REDD+ activities for conserving carbon stored in forests to reduce GHG emissions and to enhance the carbon sink function of forests are expected to serve as an important means for achieving the climatic goal. In this study, a set of criteria was devised to assess the REDD+ Measuring, Reporting, and Verifying (MRV) implementation capabilities of developing countries, which was applied to analyze the REDD+ MRV levels in REDD+ countries. Based on the Forest Reference Emission Level/Forest Reference Level (FREL/FRL), National Strategy (NS), National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) and Safeguard Information Summary (SIS) the countries submitted, 36 REDD+ countries submitted only the FREL/FRL (Group I), while 5 countries fulfilled the WRF requirements and registered REDD+ reduction results (Group II), and 6 received Results-Based Payments (RBP) (Group III). From longest to shortest, the periods for which the International Fund provided support were arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, verifying the relative importance of international support. From highest to lowest, the overall MRV capability was also arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, although Group I or Group II was at a higher level than the other groups in some elements. REDD+ countries in the Readiness Phase (Group I) would aim to have the MRV capabilities of Groups II and III to receive RBP, and international support for REDD+ MRV capacity building could enable them to do. However, in addition to the receipt of RBP, REDD+ should be reflected in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as consistent reduction results at the national GHG inventory level, and the advancement of REDD+ MRV is expected to be a necessary and sufficient condition for REDD+ cooperation under the Paris Agreement cooperative approach framework. For the following groups, international cooperation is essential. Countries in the Readiness Phase need to be supported with the establishment of an MRV framework, which will enable them to achieve REDD+ to receive RBP and be reflected in NDCs.

The overall objective of this research was to analyze the extent to which dominance - understood as the decision-making power of borrowers or resource savers - affects the performance of credit cooperatives. This study integrates problems of agency between principal-principal and conceptions of cooperativism. The centrality of the discussions lies in the potential conflict between borrowers and credit savers and their effect on performance. From the literature review, two hypotheses have been proposed in order to evaluate the relationship between domination and performance. As research strategy was carried out data collection of cooperatives affiliated to the Cooperative Credit System SICREDI. In order to reach the objective of the research, multivariate data analysis was used as a technique with the use of panel data from 39 cooperatives affiliated to SICREDI, from 2008 to 2014. The data indicated that the dominance index is an influential factor and statistically significant return on assets (ROA). Another relevant contribution was the identification of domination by borrowers and the absence of neutral cooperatives, which may violate the real function of credit cooperatives, their sustainability and their commitment to the guiding principles of cooperativism, thus moving away from their assumptions, culminating in practices contradictory to his discourse.","[Westrup, Mario Nazzari] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense Unesc, Dev Socioecon, Criciuma, Brazil; [Oliveira Camilo, Silvio Parodi] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense Unesc, Ciencias Contabeis, Criciuma, Brazil; [Estevam, Dimas de Oliveira] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense Unesc, Sociol Polit, Criciuma, Brazil",Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense; Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense; Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense,"Westrup, MN (corresponding author), Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense Unesc, Dev Socioecon, Criciuma, Brazil.",mario.westrup@w3ge.com; parodi@unesc.net; doe@unesc.net,"camilo, Silvio parodi oliveira/B-5573-2014; de Estevam, Dimas/AAP-9039-2020","de Estevam, Dimas/0000-0002-8116-2209",,,,,51,0,1,2,13,CENTRO UNIV SENAC,FLORIANOPOLIS,"RUA FELIPE SCHMIDT 785, CENTRO, FLORIANOPOLIS, SC 88010-002, BRAZIL",2237-4558,,,NAVUS-REV GEST TECNO,Navus-Rev.

Before making any credit decisions, credit analysis (the assessment of the financial history and financial backgrounds of the borrowers) should be completed as part of the screening process. Good borrowers with low credit risk would be granted a loan, while a high risk borrower would be denied. A good credit risk assessment assists financial institutions on loan pricing, determining the amount of credit, credit risk management, reduction of default risk and increase in debt repayment. The purpose of this paper is to develop a lending decision model (credit scoring) for the agricultural sector in Thailand. The data used in this study is from Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC), a major lender in Thailand agricultural sector. During the period of 2001 to 2003 a total of 16,560 agricultural loans were made available. The logistic regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to identify critical factors in lending decision process in the agricultural sector and to predict the borrower's creditworthiness (probability of a good loan). The results of the logistic regression verify the importance of total farm asset value, capital turnover ratio (efficiency), and the length of bank-borrower relationship (duration) as important factors in determining the creditworthiness of the borrowers. The results show that a higher value of farm assets implies a higher creditworthiness, which lead to a higher probability of a good loan. However, the negative signs found on both capital turnover ratio and the length of bank-borrower relationship (duration), which contradict with the hypothesized signs, suggest that the borrower with a longer relationship with the bank and a higher gross income to total assets has a higher probability to default on debt repayment. The overall prediction accuracy of the logistic lending decision models is above 85% on both in-sample and out-of-sample forecast, and is higher than the probabilistic neural network (PNN) model on out-of-sample forecast. However, the neural network models can detect Type I error (accepting a bad loan as a good loan) more accurately than the logistic models. The costs of classifying a bad loan as a good loan (Type I error) are more significant than the costs of misclassifying a good loan as a bad loan (Type II error). The overall prediction accuracy is not completely reliable since it ignores the relative cost difference between Type I and Type II errors. Thus, when the expected loss of misclassification is computed and compared, the results indicate that the misclassification cost of the PNN model is the best model with the lowest misclassification costs. In summary, the empirical results found in this study support the use of PNN model in classifying and screening agricultural loan applications in Thailand.","[Limsombunchai, V; Gan, C.] Lincoln Univ, Commerce Div, Lincoln, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Limsombunchai, V (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Commerce Div, Lincoln, New Zealand.",limsombv@lincoln.ac.nz,"Gan, Christopher/D-6635-2018","Gan, Christopher/0000-0002-5618-1651",,,,,21,0,0,0,1,MODELLING & SIMULATION SOC AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND INC,CHRISTCHURCH,"MSSANZ, CHRISTCHURCH, 00000, NEW ZEALAND",,,978-0-9758400-2-3,,,,2005,,,,,,,573,579,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BUQ81,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000290114100083,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article discusses one such experiment that women's savings and credit cooperatives in Nepal have undertaken to mediate conflict and build peace at the local levels. Using women's narratives emerging from interviews and focus group discussions, the gendered assumptions behind women's community-based peacebuilding activities, and implications for women's sustained participation in peace work, are examined. The findings reveal that this model of peacebuilding relied on educating and training women but neglected to explore the structural inequalities that cause violence. Indeed, the expectation placed on women's savings and credit co-operative members to perform unremunerated and sustained peace work in their communities may itself reflect inequalities of power that community-based peace models need to address.","Siena Coll, Dept Econ, Loudonville, NY 12210 USA",,"Ramnarain, S (corresponding author), Siena Coll, Dept Econ, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12210 USA.",sramnarain@siena.edu,,"Ramnarain, Smita/0000-0003-1487-8415",Canadian Cooperatives Association,Canadian Cooperatives Association,Research for this article was made possible through funding provided by the Canadian Cooperatives Association.,,34,5,7,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0010-3802,1468-2656,,COMMUNITY DEV J,Community Dev.

J,"Landin, SA",,,,"Landin, Sofia Arana",,,A study of the statutory background for worker cooperatives in the US: a proposal for a regulatory framework,BOLETIN DE LA ASOCIACION INTERNACIONAL DE DERECHO COOPERATIVO-INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COOPERATIVE LAW JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,worker cooperatives; taxation; USA; IRC; judicial doctrine,,"The lack of a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for worker cooperatives is one of the main causes for their scarcity in the USA, as it causes ignorance and uncertainty even though cooperatives are one of several forms of doing business recognized by the Internal Revenue Code (like sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, LLC's, and Subchapter S corporations). Tax laws divide businesses into those categories, each with its own special tax provisions and worker cooperatives try to fit into any of those forms of business while acting on a cooperative basis, thus, having their own specificities. Even though at a State level there are regulations for agricultural cooperatives in all States, there are only less than 30 States that have either worker cooperative regulations, general cooperative regulations or consumer regulations which worker cooperatives can use. However, the situation in the USA now demands for these entities. The fact that a particular attention is being given to worker cooperatives as an aftermath of the recent crisis is not news, as we have seen, historically(2), cooperatives have traditionally emerged in situations where the public sector was unable to provide the response required by the people, for instance in support for financial access, housing, or decent livelihoods. As ZEULI and CROPP3 state it: The historical development of cooperative businesses cannot be disconnected from the social and economic forces that shaped them. Co-ops then, as now, were created in times and places of economic stress and social upheaval. Different studies(4) during the previous recession show how worker cooperatives increase their turnover and number of jobs, while other enterprises shrink, being this the reason why their study at this moment becomes a must. Thus, there should be a minimum understanding and control of what a worker cooperative is in order to be able to register and act like a real worker cooperative. Quoting GUTNECHT(5) allowing something that is not a cooperative to call itself a cooperative squanders a precious asset - the goodwill and public trust that reposes in the word 'cooperative'. Thus, the USA is missing a very important instrument in order to fight against unemployment, inequality, income maldistribution and unsustainable development at a time when there is a conscience by a majority of the population in different movements that demand a change. This change is possible if educational, cultural and legal issues are properly addressed, as it has been done in other countries and higher instances(6), creating a fairer, equitable and more cohesive and sustainable society, thus a better world to live in. This paper aims to conduct a comparative statutory research on cooperative law for worker cooperatives in the USA, with a view of promoting an increased understanding within the academic and governmental communities, at a national and international level in order to promote worker cooperatives. In the case of New York public policies tacking this issue are already being devised. If this goal is achieved we will all benefit from them.","[Landin, Sofia Arana] Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Landin, SA (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.",sofia.arana@ehu.es,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,5,UNIV DEUSTO FACULTAD FILOSOFIA Y LETRAS,BILBAO,"ATTN IGNACIO ELIZALDE APARTADO 1, BILBAO, SPAIN",1134-993X,2386-4893,,BOL ASOC INT DERECHO,Bol.

Design/methodology/approach From inquiry result analysis with 305 dairy sector experts, the authors performed statistical tests using the technique of factorial analysis and confirmatory factorial analysis to confirm and/or refute the dairy production barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). Findings The results confirmed the presence of the barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The barrier lack of cooperation between the chain actors is presented as the biggest obstacle in the sector, according to the interviewees. The authors also found that rural exodus is the barrier with the smallest impact on the dairy sector development in relation to other barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The confirmation of these barriers in practice allows developing new studies to eliminate and/or mitigate these barriers of the dairy sector. Furthermore, the study might shed some light on dairy production activities and help improve management skills.

The authors observed the lack of data characterizing the dairy production system in Santa Catarina. Originality/value This study presents theoretical and practical contribution. By the confirmation that these barriers are present in the field, it is possible to direct new studies that seek to mitigate them and results in dairy production improvements. As for the practical contribution, the confirmation of those barriers can serve as a basis for the dairy sector decision-making actors, such as government, research institutions, and extension, producers, cooperatives, among others, and assist them in developing strategic actions that concern a cooperative way to develop the whole sector.","[Bonamigo, Andrei] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Prod & Syst Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Ferenhof, Helio Aisenberg] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Postgrad Program Informat & Commun Technol, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Tezza, Rafael] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Forcellini, Fernando Antonio] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Mech Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Bonamigo, A (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Prod & Syst Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",andreibonamigo@gmail.com; helio@igci.com.br; rafaeltezza@yahoo.com.br; forcellini@gmail.com,"Forcellini, Fernando A/W-4477-2018; FERENHOF, H.

Based on the analysis we conclude that the interpretations regarding co-operative identity, its central, distinctive and enduring features, were interpreted very collectively. Since the study is based on the premises of interpretative research paradigm, we believe identity at a collective level is an evolving phenomenon constructed by individual interpretations.

Their image has the Aurora Borealis dancing in the winter sky; the wonderful Denali National Park surrounding the tallest mountain in North America, Mt. McKinley (20,320 feet); and, abundant wildlife in all parts of the state. All of these images symbolize the beauty of nature where man's power doesn't reach. Alaska is the largest state in the U.S. at 591,000 square miles and is larger than Texas, California and Montana combined. Alaska's environment zones include the Arctic, sub-Arctic and rainforest. Each area presents many challenges for its communities such as solid waste disposal, recycling and wastewater treatment. The greatest challenge for these three issues is in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions for Alaska's 200+ remote villages. Even transportation in remote areas comes with unique complications and considerations that are not apparent at first - such as the wide utilization of 4-wheelers and snow machines in the Arctic and sub-Arctic as well as boats in the Southeast rainforest. Seagoing barges from Seattle bring fuel oil, gasoline, food supplies, building supplies, vehicles and other necessities to coastal and Yukon River villages. Circumstances unique to Alaska with its huge landmass and different environmental zones are not experienced in the Lower 48 states or in countries such as in Japan where space is limited and recycling is critical. Part of the answer to assist remote rural communities to address all these issues involves the transfer and utilization of NEW Technology as well as the application of other Educational Technologies and Processes to assist the transfer process. Distance, costs, culture, population size, etc. are all factors that become very relevant to the success of the endeavor. Prior to 1959 - The early years - to augment face-2-face and class room/workshop sessions, there was radio, telephone, and mail as the means of communication. The dog sled in winter and bush planes were the common mode of transportation between villages. These were the limitations when we discuss information/technology dissemination methodologies. The University of Alaska with its Land Grant Status and the Cooperative Extension Service circa 1935 Matanuska-Susitna (Matsu) Colony, was one model with the intended purpose of information/technology transfer to remote rural Alaska. There were others. This presentation analyzes Alaska educational, information, communication, and demonstration technologies along with their relative successes and limitations in the educational process, both formal and informal. The focus initially will be through the experiences of the US Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension system in Alaska as it relates to technology transfer and to educational delivery. The experiences presented will include the University of Alaska which will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1917 and its statewide network of local community campuses; and, various governmental, NGO, and private sector experiences in utilizing various educational technologies (to include organizational management approaches) to connect and move forward Alaska's communities, both large and small.","[Nakazawa, A.; Sorensen, F.; DeHass, D.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Matsuura, H.] Taisei Gakuin Univ, Osaka, Japan",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Nakazawa, A (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,12,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1079,,978-84-616-8412-0,INTED PROC,,,2014,,,,,,,6057,6057,,,,,,1,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BE0SN,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000366835106012,View Full Record in Web of Science

A cost efficiency model is used to understand the relationship of product offerings and business cycle response upon bank performance. Design/methodology/approach - A cost efficiency model is used to understand the relationship of product offerings and business cycle response upon bank performance. Markets comprised of alternate size and type of financial institutions are compared. Findings - Greater values of X_EFFi when institutions compete are observed in this analysis. Cost efficiency is lowest when community banks are the only institution in the market, and second lowest when credit unions are the only competing institutions. Call report data are analyzed from 1994 to 2013. The number of big banks increases community bank efficiency and efficiency of large banks. Also, the number of community banks does affect big bank cost efficiency. The magnitude of the effect pertaining to the number of community banks upon big bank efficiency is much smaller than that of the number of big banks on community bank efficiency. Originality/value - This study considers cost efficiency and profitability as measures of institution on the performance of a competing institutional type. The modeling approach uses cost efficiency as a method of observing the performance of financial institutions and an explanation of how firms persist, grow, and respond to changes in technology or regulation.

We address this question by analyzing how the organizational structures of banks and banking markets were associated with unemployment trajectories in local economies during the Great Recession. Two county-level analyses yield convergent results. Increasing branch densities of giant derivative holding banks within local economies were associated with greater surges in unemployment, weaker employment recoveries and stronger recession effects on unemployment from 2007 through 2016. Increasing branch densities of community banks and credit unions and localism in banking were associated with lower unemployment spikes, stronger recoveries and dampened crisis effects. These findings advance sociological studies of finance by providing new quantitative evidence for links between the social structures of banking and economic performance. They also confound arguments that decentralized systems of small, locally based financial institutions are inherently fragile by design, suggesting instead that alternatives to 'too-big-to-fail' banking can enhance local economies' capacities to adapt proactively, withstand crisis and sustain employment during recessions.","[Schneiberg, Marc; Parmentier, Eleanor] Reed Coll, Dept Sociol, Portland, OR 97202 USA",Reed College - Oregon,"Schneiberg, M (corresponding author), Reed Coll, Dept Sociol, Portland, OR 97202 USA.",marc.schneiberg@reed.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1528190]; Stillman Drake and Corbett/Goldhammer funds at Reed College; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1528190] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Stillman Drake and Corbett/Goldhammer funds at Reed College; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The research reported here was supported by a National Science Foundation grant #1528190, and the Stillman Drake and Corbett/Goldhammer funds at Reed College.",,114,7,7,3,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The areas are exploited to produce inefficiently, and so is the system of incentives and subsidies. Therefore, Croatia is highly dependent on food imports. Although there are still one in three people living in agricultural households, only a few food products are being produced in quantities sufficient for national needs. On food imports such as the one in 2008, Croatia has spent $ 1.5 billion. Rural areas occupy about 85 percent of the territory, and 85 percent of villages are affected by depopulation. Residents of rural areas are characterized by increasing life expectancy and a fifth of the rural population aged between 25 and 40 years wants to move to the cities. In fact, almost half of agricultural land is classified in the group threatened by erosion. Nearly a third of all agricultural land suffers from acidity. More and more farmland is lost by converting agricultural land into construction land. For these reasons, the strategic goal of increasing agricultural production will not be easy to achieve. To achieve this we need to change priorities in national policy towards agriculture and rural areas. It is considered that a major obstacle in the way of raising productivity is the small area (approximately 1.9 hectares) owned by agricultural households. These households, on the other hand, have approximately 80 percent of agricultural resources. Fragmentation of agricultural land does not adopt the global economy, but emphasizes large, easier and faster cost-effective systems. Small agricultural households are facing destruction, and without them there is no life in rural areas and caring for the environment. The imperative to raise productivity in agriculture comes into conflict with the objectives of rural development and sustainable development. In order to counter such trends, the EU wants to use incentives to adjust small and medium-sized farms to market conditions. However, the distributional impact of incentives is such that large manufacturers picked the most money, rather than small and medium producers. This effect leads to land consolidation, the creation of large landowners and the development of profitable food industry. Deregulation and the promotion of competitiveness in agriculture and food industry further complicate the survival of viable rural communities. In surviving villages, the EU wants to develop the competitiveness and diversification of agricultural production in rural households (e. g. tourism and rural crafts). In this paper we explore the ambivalence of European agricultural policy and its impact on Croatian agriculture and countryside, and try to answer the question whether this policy, in the case of Croatia, will lead to the collapse of local agriculture, the disappearance of rural communities and food price increases. Based on experiences of other countries and theoretical models, the paper gives outlines of a national agricultural policy which would, for example, through the development of cooperatives and clusters protect family farms and households living in rural areas. At the same time such a policy could affect the increase in agricultural yield and income of small and medium-sized farmers.","[Odobasa, Rajko] Fac Law, Dept Econ Sci, Osijek, Stjepana Radica, Croatia",,,rodobasa@pravos.hr,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,10,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,108,117,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000318478600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, cooperatives like their business cousins in the public corporations have been plagued with governance issues (Shaw, 2006). This has prompted studies to isolate the probable causes of their predicament. The issue of corporate governance of cooperatives has begun to become mainstream in research and conventional wisdom dictates that governance procedures and processes that abound in the corporate world can prudently be applicable in the governance of cooperatives (Cornforth; 2004). In a cooperative the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the collective interest of the members (Jussila, Goel, & Tuominen, 2012). Board of Directors need to demonstrate adequate and effective monitoring of organizations they are helming. This paper examines how the board of directors can act as a custodian against financial fiasco in cooperatives organizations. Our study focuses on the association of size of Board of Directors of cooperatives and the frequency of board meetings with performance. Outcomes from the study indicated both the size of the board and the frequency of board meetings has no relationships with performance of cooperatives organizations in Malaysia. The results suggest that the board of directors may no longer be effective in managing the cooperatives towards achieving their members' objectives. Various literatures supported this finding. This result lends the conclusion that governance of cooperatives is in dire need of revision to increase its effectiveness and eventually rightly positioning cooperatives as a bona fide catalyst of national development as well protect the interest of the members.","[Othman, Rohana; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul; Arif, Siti Maznah Mohd; Choo, Huang Ching; Ismail, Norashikin] Univ Telcnol MARA, Accounting Res Inst, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Othman, Rohana; Embi, Roslani; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul; Arif, Siti Maznah Mohd; Choo, Huang Ching; Ismail, Norashikin] Univ Telcnol MARA, Fac Accountancy, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Othman, R (corresponding author), Univ Telcnol MARA, Accounting Res Inst, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",rohana799@salam.uitm.edu.my; roslani@salam.uitm.edu.my; nooraslinda@salam.uitm.edu.my; maznah542@salam.uitm.edu.my; Ching599@salam.uitm.edu.my; shikin673@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Ismail, Norashikin/AAP-1811-2021; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul/ABG-6280-2020; Othman, Rohana/B-7340-2016; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul/S-9876-2017","Ismail, Norashikin/0000-0002-1889-7800; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul/0000-0001-7369-5091; Othman, Rohana/0000-0002-4223-1435;",Accounting Research Institute; Ministry of Education Malaysia,"Accounting Research Institute; Ministry of Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",We would like to thank Accounting Research Institute and Ministry of Education Malaysia for the grants to finance this research.,,51,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1431,+,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000339301500139,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of the article is to identify current problems of strengthening the social capital of rural territorial communities in the context of administrative and territorial reform with the definition of directions for their solution. Methodology / approach. The paper uses general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis to collect, process, and systematize the results of scientific research; abstract-logical and critical analysis - to identify possible risks due to the implementation of administrative-territorial reform; statistical - for data collection and systematization; method of comparisons - to identify the compliance of the dynamics of various forms of social capital to the potential of communities; graphic - to visualize the results of the assessment of the new spatial configuration of socio-territorial communities and the dynamics of accumulation of various forms of social capital; correlation and regression analysis - to determine the impact of certain indicators of social capital development on the economy of rural communities; induction and deduction - to substantiate the main directions of social capital development of rural communities in modern conditions. Results. Restrictions on the development of social capital accumulation have been identified, which include: shadowing of interaction and low trust in social institutions, individualization of behavioral strategies, growth of economically inactive and socially vulnerable groups, and formation of networks of discriminatory relationships, spreading of norms of destructive social behavior, as well as the risks that may arise in the new spatial configuration of socio-territorial communities. It is established that the administrative-territorial reform at the local level has created certain preconditions for strengthening the potential of horizontally and vertically integrating social capital. It was found that the dynamics of territorial identification of the population of Ukraine in relation to their community is negative and indicates low social capital at the local level. The dynamics of forms of horizontally integrating social capital of rural communities, which are represented by agricultural cooperatives, farms, and inter-community cooperation, are analyzed and it is found that the potential of their development in Ukraine has not been realized yet. The necessity of implementation of systemic decisions on the development of social capital of communities to achieve the main goals of decentralization of management is proved. The main directions of the development of social capital of rural communities are substantiated taking into account modern features of their development. Originality / scientific novelty. The specifics of the formation of social capital of rural communities as small local communities are analyzed, taking into account the main determinants of influence, which include increasing territorial mobility and maintaining the asymmetry of spatial development in the direction of the center-periphery, the choice of adaptive behavioral strategies due to changes in the territorial identification of the population and the assessment of opportunities to achieve a certain level of well-being in the community. The main directions of social capital development as a prerequisite for uniting and mobilizing internal resources for rural development are substantiated based on existing problems and identified potential risks due to the reform of local self-government and territorial organization of government. Scientific and methodological bases of research on social capital at the local level under conditions of social and economic instability are improved. Practical value / implications. The results of the study will be useful for local governments of territorial communities formed as a result of local government reform and territorial organization of government, as well as district and regional state administrations, which focus on promoting inclusive community development and self-sufficiency.","[Zaiats, Tetiana; Kraievska, Halyna; Diakonenko, Oksana] NAS Ukraine, Ptoukha Inst Demog & Social Studies, Kiev, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Ptoukha Institute for Demography & Social Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,"Zaiats, T (corresponding author), NAS Ukraine, Ptoukha Inst Demog & Social Studies, Kiev, Ukraine.",,,"Dakonenko, Oksana/0000-0003-4645-7471; Zaiats, Tetiana/0000-0002-9767-5527; Kraievska, Halyna/0000-0002-0239-8855",,,,,30,3,3,0,0,INST EASTERN EUROPEAN RESEARCH & CONSULTING,KHARKIV,"EDUC CAMPUS KNAU, KHARKIV, UKRAINE",,2414-584X,,AGR RESOUR EC INT SC,Agric.

To build customer trust and provide members incentives, the organization structures itself as a producer cooperative and sets up a parallel sector that yields cash revenues and provides short-term benefits. This parallel activity, if successful, may represent a temptation away from revolution, but it is subject to competition from other providers or from the state. The main result is that, unlike a profit-maximizing firm, the cooperative reacts to increased competition by shrinking the parallel sector and specializing in revolution; hence, reform expands at the expense of revolution only if the parallel sector approaches monopoly.

This paper draws on a case study of organic rice farming in Hongdong District, South Korea, and provides insights into communitarian cooperative organic farming, a collective organic farming model. Various organic farming practices (e.g. integrated rice duck farming) have been collectively adopted by small-scale rice farmers in Hongdong since 1994. Organic rice farming in Hongdong is characterised by place-based cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, and strong community leadership. Hongdong has demonstrated that communitarianism and smallholder cooperatives can work for each other complementarily and therefore that communitarian organic farming through smallholder cooperatives is highly operational. The Hongdong organic farming model is of great relevance to other parts of rice-growing Asia, which are dominated by smallholding farmers, in terms of the twin goals of food security and food safety.

Through the use of institutional and agency theory, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the cooperative form of organization and investor-owned firms-investigating how the social-political structures in a community affect the efficiency of cooperatives vis-a-vis investor-owned firms. This paper also attempts to offer a better understanding of how government quality and organizational size influence performance outcomes between different organizational forms specifically in the Philippines. Design Methodology Approach The empirical analysis of this study was conducted among electric distribution utilities in the Philippines. Firm-level data was generated for 133 distributors, consisting of 119 electric cooperatives and 14 investor-owned companies. Panel data regressions were ran to test all hypotheses. Findings Cooperative organizations operate at a less efficient rate than investor-owned firms in the Philippines, even when controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, customer density and profitability. In addition, the efficiency of these cooperative organizations is more strongly influenced by the quality of the local government than investor-owned firms. Originality Value Positive externalities generated by the propagation of cooperatives on local communities may be based primarily on our understanding of how cooperatives have functioned largely in western contexts.

The aim of this paper is to explore the agricultural context of Rome, focusing on its relationships with development in the metropolitan area, within the framework of sustainable food planning. Starting from the relationship between food and city, we have mapped the foodscape, identifying a number of representative conditions - typologies - in the metropolitan area of Rome. Through a of criteria - relationships with the urban fabric, production patterns, flows, services, infrastructures, environmental characters, social behaviour linked with the production - the study tries to summarise Roman agriculture. We focus on a set of recurring elements, involving both criticalities and opportunities, that bring together city and food production. Rome has what we could call a compact structure compared to the dispersed urban model and this has encouraged the development of local agricultural systems, where both flows and landscapes involve the city. While production is organised into wedge-shaped areas, the places where exchanges occur are mainly within the municipal area of Rome, with the exception of farms involved in direct sales. Despite a strong urbanization pressure caused a reduction of 42% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) between 1990 and 2000, this trend was reverted back between 2000 and 2010, with an increase of the UAA of 14%. The analysis of land use (CLC, 2006) reveals a system of wedge-shaped agricultural areas, where short supply chain models can be used efficiently to manage and promote the use of land and landscape. In synthesis, in terms of their production systems, there is a high number of short supply chain farms in Rome (over 40%), mostly with mixed production systems linked to multifunctional farming. The role played by the local food network in Rome is remarkable, particularly in case of farmers' market, SPG' and those linked to box schemes experiences have seen significant success. The increasing importance of Alternative and Local Food Networks is showed in the data: the 60% of Rome municipalities farms sell directly (Istat, 2010) it was registered an increase of + 57% Farmers' market at municipality level and of + 64% in Rome's province (2010/13) (Marino et al., 2013). The local food network behind agriculture in the city, within a number of integrated social agrarian cooperative, who represented an alternative food production system and landmark for many initiatives carried out by the civil society, associations, cooperatives, volunteer and school sectors, community supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives. This account of short supply chains in Rome is inevitably the account of an urban phenomenon. It is indeed the city that determines its special characteristics for both physical and relational aspects. The mapped farms are mostly located near the main routes that radiate from the city to the countryside, underlining the centrality of the flow of exchanges that take place with the city. The processes of transformation affecting the primary sector in urban and suburban environments reflect an agriculture that forms (and produces) new landscape and functions, typically reconnected to the historical value of agriculture in and around the Mediterranean cities. Food, because of its cultural and historical place in Mediterranean tradition, has a significant role in configuring the areas where exchanges takes place, which are, therefore, specific places for meeting and forming relationships within the public spaces of a city. The system identified by the paper configures the set of all the different forms of agriculture and food in Rome as a device of resilience for the city, made up of places where flows, relationships and processes become increasingly more sustainable, and where both physical and intangible spaces act as an infrastructure in their exchange with the city.

The key elements of such programmes are that local communities are given ownership rights or custodianship and management responsibilities over wildlife, and that they gain social and economic benefits from conservation of the resources. However, to date, there have been only a few studies that offer in-depth analyses of the interplay between governance processes and livelihood impacts of CBWC programmes. Here, I conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions in five wildlife conservancies in the Maasai Mara ecosystem in Kenya to address the following questions: i) What are the perceived impacts of the wildlife conservancies on livelihoods of the local people? ii) To what extent are the wildlife conservancies governed in relation to the principles of environmental governance? I assessed impacts on livelihoods by applying the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to explore perceived conservancy-related benefits and costs (i.e. perceived changes in social, financial, human, physical, and natural capitals). I assessed governance by asking the respondents whether the following eight principles of environmental governance were applied: legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, integration, capability, and adaptability. Perceived benefits of participating in wildlife co-management were identified as: enhanced income from gainful employment and new business opportunities, membership to cooperative societies and participation in community work (e.g. school bursary and feeding programmes), enhanced social relations, improved access to credit and health facilities, enhanced physical infrastructure (schools, roads and bridges), improved physical security and coordinated sharing of provisioning ecosystem services like pasture and water. The principles of legitimacy, inclusiveness, and integration had reportedly been well implemented in wildlife co-management. However, the institutional mechanisms for sharing resources within the conservancies lacked transparency, accountability, and fairness, and tended to favour those who were politically connected to the leadership of the conservancies. Moreover, most of the conservancies had weak systems and few resources to facilitate delivery on responsibilities (i.e. had low capability), and had some costs associated with human-wildlife conflicts. For an improved co-management of wildlife to be achieved in these conservancies, local institutions should be reconfigured to allow active participation by conservancy landowners in decision-making, information sharing, and equitable access to conservancy-related benefits.","[Oduor, Ayub M.

In the general context of sustainable development, to achieve this objective, of the needs of rural microfinance, implementation of economic models that gives an impulse to align this area to the market economy principles and requirements is essential. The models must be adapted to the concrete and real needs of those who are living and working in rural areas. Being at the start of this research theme that I want to draw, I realize that such a challenge is both difficult and subject to the risk that some of the advanced ideas may not be in the accordance with the current financing policy of decision makers. Beyond these considerations, is necessary to disclose that to the level of community states, this dynamic market is still quite heterogeneous because of the institutional and legislative disparity and also because of very diversified microcredit providers. In the EU, microcredit is provided by financial institutions regulated by the Central Banks and those unregulated by the Central Bank, but covered by Community Directives, such as commercial banks, savings banks, cooperative banks and public banks. To these are added a number of non-banking institutions namely microfinance institutions, enterprises specialized in microfinance, foundations, credit unions, charities, NGOs and others. It should be underlitied that the 2014-2020 Romanian rural development strategy, in the context of the 2020 Europe, strategy is a strategy of economic growth with objectives for a smart economy, sustainable and favorable to social inclusion and the improvement of agricultural and non -agricultural SME's competitiveness from the countryside. The scientific approach that I try to define starts from the fact that the Romanian rural area, a total of 2.7 million peasant households, which together account for more than 5 million hectares or 34 percent of the agricultural area of the country is outside the current system of agricultural financing. They are added 2 million people in rural areas without any plot of land, without a job, who live in extreme poverty. Transferring these european ideas in the Romanian context and correlating it with the statistic economic situation in Romania, I believe that through the creation of economic models of microfinance and in accordance with current regulatory framework, we can contribute to the sustainable development of this considerable potential that we identified in rural Romania.","Inst Natl Cercetari Econ Costin C Kiritescu, Bucharest, Romania",National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

This paper aims to offer an assessment of the record of the British consumer co-operative movement's efforts to abide by and promote its values and principles during the first 137 years of its existence (1863 to 1990). Design/methodology/approach The paper is developed using largely qualitative research methods and a variety of sources. These include archival resources and business-historical materials such as committee minutes and correspondence. These materials have been complemented by several semi-structured recorded interviews with senior members of the Co-operative Group. Findings The authors develop several conclusions. First, where ethical choices were possible and no serious commercial interests were impaired, the co-operative movement could and usually did do its best to adhere to its principles. Second, in several instances, commercial interests did frequently trump ideals. Finally, the organisational structure of the movement made it very difficult to ensure that co-operative principles and values were adhered to. Originality/value This paper presents a unique case-study that examines the inherent tension between commerce and ethics in the co-operative movement.","[Webster, Anthony] Northumbria Univ, Dept Humanities, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Wilson, John F.; Wong, Nicholas D.] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University; Newcastle University - UK; Northumbria University,"Wong, NID (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",tony.webster@northumbria.ac.uk; john.f.wilson@northumbria.ac.uk; nicholas.d.wong@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Webster, Anthony/0000-0002-1424-0318; Wong, Nicholas/0000-0002-4667-978X",,,,,52,2,2,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1751-1348,1758-7751,,J MANAG HIST,J.

Although water-saving technologies (WSTs) have been introduced for decades, sustained commitment to WST is not being met. This paper investigates factors affecting adoption and sustained adoption of WST based on 261 households in the North China Plain. We employ Heckman's two-stage sample selection process: (1) households decide whether to adopt WST or not and (2) households decide whether to sustainably adopt (adopt for a long time) WST or not. Particular attention is paid to the role of water scarcity in the initial adoption and sustained adoption stages. Several indicators relating to water scarcity are used to calculate a water scarcity index based on principal component analysis. The results showed that water scarcity exerts a significant and positive effect on both adoption and sustained adoption of WST. Non-adopters and non-sustained adopters face less severe water scarcity than adopters. Membership in cooperative organizations significantly improves the likelihood of sustained adoption; 63.6% of sustained adopters have a membership in cooperative organizations, compared with 18.2% of non-sustained adopters. The number of plots negatively affects the sustained adoption of WST; sustained adopters on average have 3.0 plots, and non-sustained adopters have 5.3 plots. Education, extension service, farm size, off-farm work, relatives working in the local government and irrigation costs are positively and significantly associated with adoption and sustained adoption decisions. Finally, we find that labor-saving capacity significantly influences both stages, whereas capital-saving capacity is only significant in the adoption stage. Only 10% of non-adopters consider adoption of WST as more labor- and capital-saving than conventional irrigation practices, in comparison with nearly 50% of adopters. These results imply that the extension of WST should consider focusing more on cooperative organizations and hold more demonstrations for farmers. Moreover, given that the degree of water shortage varies from region to region, the WST extension standards should vary accordingly. Governments should strengthen awareness by enhancing education and publicity concerning water scarcity and conservation.","[Wang, Shuhong; Yang, Zhihai] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuhong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Yin, Ning] Hunan Agr Univ, Econ Coll, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Renmin University of China; Hunan Agricultural University,"Yang, ZH (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",wang_shuhong@126.com; zhyang@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Yang, Zhihai/GQP-6872-2022","Wang, Shuhong/0000-0002-9585-4839",National Social Science Foundation of China [16CGL038]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662020JGPY006],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),We gratefully acknowledge the National Social Science Foundation of China (No.16CGL038) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2662020JGPY006).,,62,11,11,3,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

The article critically examines the outcomes of innovative governance responses to socio-ecological risk through an analysis of the roles of the cooperative organisation Genossenschaft Gran Alpin, according to the perceptions of its farmer members. Gran Alpin provides a secure premium price for cereal producers in Graubunden linked to the uniqueness of local organic mountain cropping systems, and all the values of local identity, landscape stewardship, biodiversity conservation and regional development that such systems represent. Gran Alpin is enabling an alternative approach for rural development to evolve around key elements, including: high quality breads, pastas, flours and beer; the mountains; the extreme production system; organic production and animal welfare; landscapes aesthetics in a core tourism region; and the cooperation of like-minded farmers. Resilience within the socio-ecological system is enhanced as the cooperative exploits evolving forms of collaboration, market niches, and private and public governance relationships to respond implicitly and explicitly to agro-ecological, economic and political risks.

An analysis of the changes that have taken place in the moshav in the past few decades reveals a process of rural restructuring, similar to that which is occurring in many developed countries. New economic activities have replaced farming as sources of income, and newcomers, mostly of urban origin, have invaded rural communities in search of a better quality of life. These changes derive from a combination of structural changes in agriculture, changing government policies and cumulative decisions of rural households. The result is a more heterogeneous moshav-physically, economically and socially, and growing regional, inter-village and intra-village disparities. These developments have a direct impact on the organizational structure of the moshav, its environmental qualities and its exchange relations with the urban sector. As part of the ongoing process of change the moshav is gradually losing some of its unique features, which formed the basis for its identity as a special type of rural community. This leads to the question of whether the moshav will be able to develop a new identity as a distinct type of rural community, or turn into a suburban or urban community. The answer will depend largely on the direction taken by government policy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the dynamics and challenges faced by these cooperative organizations have been largely bypassed in the fair trade literature. In this context, this paper aims to unpack the multiple, coexisting and interwoven marketing channels available for small-scale coffee producers, unveiling potential sources of uncertainty and tensions among competing actors and interests, and identifying and assessing the strategies used by organizations to influence farmers' marketing decisions. The analysis comprises two case studies based in the department of Huehuetenango (Guatemala), where the existence of distinct marketing channels combines with processes of product differentiation, namely organic production. Results show the limitations of standard fair trade mechanisms to secure farmers' engagement with cooperative organizations. Rather, technical advice to improve farming practices and quality construction seem to be a more effective mechanism to govern this collective supply chain. Nevertheless, these strategies could be further constrained by productive and organizational factors, affecting the sustainability of potential benefits delivered by these key collective actors.

Design/methodology/approach This study applied qualitative methods to evaluate the organizational biographies of Factories five factories, using open interviews and document analysis. Findings The findings show that before privatization took place, these industries were managed according to socialistic democratic principles. Once they became global and capitalistic, some kibbutz industries adopted a business cooperative style that combines features of capitalism and socialism, while others underwent a crisis and opted for a stricter and more bureaucratic managerial style. Research limitations/implications This research is based on five case studies; further research is recommended to establish the current typology. Practical implications This study shows very clearly that the cooperative business style can be offered for businesses previously operated according to socialistic principles. Originality/value This study augments current literature by elucidating the speed with which business activity is conducted according to cooperative principles. It presents a typology relevant to kibbutz industry and cooperative organizations alike, addressing the cooperative managerial, cooperative business and bureaucratic styles, enabling maintenance of normative management that adapts itself to global and capitalistic environments.","[Moskovich, Yaffa] Zefat Acad Coll, Safed, Israel",,"Moskovich, Y (corresponding author), Zefat Acad Coll, Safed, Israel.",mosko777@gmail.com,,,,,,,83,4,4,1,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2040-8269,2040-8277,,MANAG RES REV,Manag.

In this article, we explore the role of farmer cooperatives in China in linking farmers with high-quality food markets. We consider food quality a social construct and farmer cooperatives key players in the 'quality battlefield'. Using a case study approach, we investigate the everyday practices of three farmer cooperatives. We show that farmer cooperatives are capable of establishing or joining quality food networks, but the benefits are often limited because of their weak position or instability of the network. Building strong alliances with other network actors is difficult because of cooperatives' limited communication capacity and lack of economic and social capital. Our findings suggest that policies that support farmer cooperative capacity building at the micro level could improve the performance of smallholder farmers and their cooperatives in the expanding domestic quality food market.","[Yang, Huan] Huazhong Agr Univ, M217 Humanities & Social Sci Bldg,1 Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Vernooy, Ronnie] Biovers Int, Rome, Italy; [Leeuwis, Cees] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands",Huazhong Agricultural University; Alliance; Bioversity International; Wageningen University & Research,"Yang, H (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, M217 Humanities & Social Sci Bldg,1 Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yanghuan11180@163.com,"Vernooy, Ronnie/AAF-5858-2021",,International Development Research Centre of Canada; National Social Science Fund [14CJY044],International Development Research Centre of Canada(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); National Social Science Fund,We are grateful to the International Development Research Centre of Canada for funding this research.

In the market, there are methodologies for credit scoring, each analyzing a large number of microeconomic and/or macroeconomic variables selected mostly depending on the type of credit to be granted. Since these variables are heterogeneous, the review process carried out by credit analysts takes time. The objective of this article is to propose a solution for this problem by applying fuzzy logic to the creation of classification rules for credit granting. To achieve this, linguistic variables were used to help the analyst interpret the information available from the credit officer. The method proposed here combines the use of fuzzy logic with a neural network and a variable population optimization technique to obtain fuzzy classification rules. It was tested with three databases from financial entities in Ecuador - one credit and savings cooperative and two banks that grant various types of credits. To measure its performance, three benchmarks were used: accuracy, number of classification rules generated, and antecedent length. The results obtained indicate that the hybrid model that is proposed performs better than its previous versions due to the addition of fuzzy logic.

The reason why these cooperatives exist in large numbers is the imbalance of benefits of government which represents the public interest, regulatory agencies and their staffs, social capitals, rich farmers and vulnerable smallholders.

Design/methodology/approach A unique data set of farmer cooperative financial statements that spans from 1996 to 2019 is used to examine the changes in profitability, solvency, liquidity and accounts receivable risk. Also, a deterministic stress test model is designed to shock bad debt expense and the resulting write-off of accounts receivable for farmer cooperatives. The stress test provides insights to the resiliency of farmer cooperatives. Findings Results find that farmer cooperatives are in a strong financial position, which has improved over time. The majority of farmer cooperatives are able to absorb a substantial increase in bad debt expense because of their sizable, retained earnings position. However, cooperatives that have significant profitability challenges do experience much larger losses, especially mixed farmer cooperatives (roughly equally amounts of grain and farm supply sales) and large cooperatives with more than $500 million in sales. Practical implications The stress test results suggest farmer cooperative managers and boards of directors could re-examine their credit policies and consider extending additional credit. Also, cooperatives should consider monitoring and identifying an optimal accounts receivable to retained earnings ratio, which is similar to how banks examine their tier 1 capital ratios. Originality/value The value of this study is having data that allows for the examination of the financial condition of farmer cooperatives over time. Also, having current data means the accounts receivable stress test results are more relevant and timelier. This is important because these accounts receivable are primarily tied to crop input supplies, and farmer cooperatives are a significant market participant in the crop input supply market.","[Mashange, Gerald; Briggeman, Brian C.] Kansas State Univ, Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Briggeman, BC (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",geraldm@ksu.edu; bbrigg@ksu.edu,,"Mashange, Gerald/0000-0001-5921-2081",,,,,14,2,2,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

By way of guaranteeing scale, quality of produce, and professionalism, cooperatives are assumed to be capable to subvert current trading patterns and contribute to sustainable market access for small-scale farmers. However, such change logic does not hold up well with the circumstances of African farmers and traders. We argue that for understanding how a cooperative organizes sustainable market linkages, attention should be paid to its capacity to navigate within its specific context. This article traces the emergence and development of two cooperatives in distinct contexts, Uganda and Mali. We use a critical institutionalist approach, called bricolage, to show how in both cases farmers organize sustainable market access by blending novel arrangements with existing institutions embedded in social and economic relations. We suggest agricultural policy and programmes to shift attention to the ability of a cooperative to embed new institutions in socio-historical shaped local realities rather than requiring them to comply to an ideal-type organization.","[Mangnus, Ellen] Univ Utrecht, Human Geog & Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Schoonhoven-Speijer, Mirjam] Wageningen Univ, Knowledge Technol & Innovat, Wageningen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Wageningen University & Research,"Mangnus, E (corresponding author), Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.p.m.mangnus@uu.nl,,,"Dutch Research Council (NWO) (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek) [406-13-109]; Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands","Dutch Research Council (NWO) (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek); Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands","We are grateful for the support received for the fieldwork in Uganda, financed by the research programme Research Talent with project number 406-13-109, which was financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek); and the fieldwork in Mali, financed by the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.",,81,10,10,2,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

This article examines the role of social capital and the interaction of social capital and formal governance in influencing the economic performance of farmer cooperatives. An empirical exploratory study is conducted based on a data set of 147 farmer cooperatives in China, and an ordinary least squares regression model is used to estimate the results. The results show that the stock of social capital can enhance the economic performance of farmer cooperatives and that social capital has a larger impact when there is stronger formal governance with regard to income distribution. Social capital and formal governance are therefore complementary. An improvement in some aspects of formal governance is favorable to the outcome of social capital. Cooperative practitioners need to consider the creation of both social capital and formal governance.","[Liang, Qiao] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Haiyang] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Deng, Wendong] Breda Univ Appl Sci, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Zhejiang University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Breda University of Applied Sciences,"Liang, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",liangqiao2323@zju.edu.cn,"Lu, Haiyang/AAB-1478-2019","Lu, Haiyang/0000-0001-5789-2319; Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863",,,,,30,11,12,6,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,SEP,2018,47,3,,,,,196,203,,10.1177/0030727018778603,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0030727018778603,,,8,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,GW7ZD,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000447191000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

It examines the relevance of assumptions of self interest, opportunism and bounded rationality in such solidaristic organizations, then uses them to calculate the costs and benefits of using participatory systems.

Co-operative Movement, in the early days after the founding of the PRC, followed the rule of centralization, which was the imposed institutional change from the top down. Household Contract Responsibility System (HCRS) has followed the rule of decentralization since 1978. And Farmers' Cooperative Organizations (FCOs), which were based on the HCRS, followed the rule of centralization. They actually realized the combination of centralization and decentralization in operation. Compared with the HCRS that was the induced institutional change from the bottom up, the FCOs Were also the induced institutional change which resulted from the combination of government's promotion and guidance with farmers' initiatives. Under the dual influences of development path dependence of the FCOs and government' standardized administration, the FSCs are booming and take the forms Smallholders' Cooperation(SC), Agriculture-related Departments' Establishment(ADE), Rural Grassroots Units' Establishment(RGUE), Leading Enterprises' Establishment(LEE), and Professional Farmers' Establishment(PFE), which adhere to the rule of interest driven. Among these patterns, the SC, which is mutual aid economic organization characterized by democratic management, is the only one that conforms to classical cooperatives' principles. Considering the domestic settings, such as urbanization, smallholders engaged in nonagricultural industries, reconstruction of government-enterprise relation, etc, and the international environment of rapid economic globalization, the right strategic options in the future are to boost the development of the LEE and the PFE, and even the cooperatives' unions and share holding cooperatives further if conditions are mature.

Promoting the stable collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain is an urgent problem. Considering the characteristic demand of consumers for agricultural products, this paper takes the supply chain mainly operating characteristic agricultural products and dominated by farmer cooperatives as the research object and constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of farmer cooperatives, manufacturers, and retailers. We study the supply chain collaboration mechanism from the main strategy choice and the specific factors affecting its strategy choice. The results show that farmer cooperatives implement a strict supervision strategy and increase the reward and punishment to promote the collaboration in the supply chain, but the increase in supervision cost is not conducive to the income of farmer cooperatives. In the case of loose supervision, the difference between the additional income and the collaboration input is higher than the free-rider income obtained when adopting a non-collaboration strategy, which is conducive to its evolution towards collaboration. In addition, increasing additional income, improving synergy coefficient, and reducing collaboration input and free-rider income will increase the probability of the system evolving to Pareto optimal, and accelerate the realization of comprehensive collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain dominated by farmer cooperatives. The research results provide a certain supplement to the related research on agricultural product supply chains in theory, and provide a reference for the comprehensive collaboration of the agricultural product supply chain dominated by farmer cooperatives in practice.","[Huo, Yujia; Guo, Xiangyu; Xu, Yang] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiali] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China",Northeast Agricultural University - China; Northeast Agricultural University - China,"Guo, XY (corresponding author), Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China.",18245115097@163.com; wjl-lily@163.com; guoxy@neau.edu.cn; 13244616535@163.com,"Wang, Jiali/IQU-4490-2023","Huo, Yujia/0000-0003-2111-9126",National Social Science Fund of China [19BJY169]; Four Batches Talent Project of Cultural Famous Masters [ZXB[2015]49],National Social Science Fund of China; Four Batches Talent Project of Cultural Famous Masters,"This research was funded by the National Social Science Fund of China, grant number 19BJY169, and Four Batches Talent Project of Cultural Famous Masters, grant number ZXB[2015]49.",,62,6,6,31,121,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,14,10,,,,,,,5824,10.3390/su14105824,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14105824,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1O5DF,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000801352100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, monitoring and even predicting future changes in creditworthiness is of value to cooperative managers and their lenders. However, we know little about farmer cooperatives' credit profiles and behavior because their financial statements are seldom shared. Using a Moody's credit rating model and a unique data set, this article estimates Markov chains to evaluate changes in farmer cooperatives' credit quality. The unconditional (one-size-fits-all) probability matrix, as is typically estimated, is shown to not be appropriate in describing credit rating transitions. Results also show cooperatives do not exhibit rating change momentum since a downgrade is not likely to be followed by another downgrade in the next period. Credit ratings of farmer cooperatives with less than $20 million in net sales follow a first-order Markov chain with stationary probabilities and the cooperatives with net sales of more than $250 million follow a zero-order Markov chain. This article adds to the limited research available on the credit rating behavior of farmer cooperatives. Cooperative managers, directors, and lenders can utilize these findings to make more informed decisions to impact future credit ratings.","[Mashange, Gerald; Featherstone, Allen M.; Briggeman, Brian C.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr EconP, 342 Waters Hall,1603 Old Claflin Pl, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Mashange, G (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr EconP, 342 Waters Hall,1603 Old Claflin Pl, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",geraldm@ksu.edu,,"Mashange, Gerald/0000-0001-5921-2081",,,,,35,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

The paper then addresses two issues: one, it answers the question what should cooperatives measure and why; and two, it suggests the framework for transformative indicators informed by the purpose of cooperative organizing.

Hermes fervently believed that public control over industry and government would revitalize democratic institutions and eradicate political repression, institutionalized racism, and corporate capitalism. Established in 1941 as a cooperative grocery store for working-class Preset Neighborhood residents, the Consumers' Co-operative Union (CCU) was the physical manifestation of Hermes's utopian vision. For more than twenty years, the CCU was a space for exchanging local and national ideas about economic cooperation, racial justice, and political reform. Indeed, Hermes depended on afar-reaching New Deal support network that transcended his neighborhood and bridged political, racial, gender, and class divides. However, this coalition disintegrated in the face of white flight, anti-Communist hysteria, and urban economic decline in the 1950s. I contend that while particular depression-era neighborhood politics nurtured the CCU, larger national economic, political, and cultural trends ultimately confounded the cooperative's ability to create sustained economic change in Freret.","Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Gessler, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,73,1,1,0,2,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",1045-991X,2154-9648,,UTOPIAN STUD,Utop.

In order to identify factors for the successful development of farmer cooperatives in Northwest China, two cases of provincially approved successful farmer cooperatives in Shandan county of Gansu province were chosen for this research. The results revealed that a stable legal environment; a dedicated initiator and leader; government financial and technical support; farmer understanding and participation of cooperative activities and appropriate external support from professional NGOs were the key factors for the successful development of farmer cooperatives in Northwest of China.

It also traces anthropologists' engagements with corporations over time. We present transformations in traditionally corporate arenas, such as mining and textile production, alongside parallel developments in transnational cooperatives, organic production systems, and ethnic deployments of the corporate form. We consider corporate influence in unexpected sectors, from conservation to poverty alleviation to cancer survival. Furthermore, we analyze corporate norms and practices in relation to broader governance trends, from fair-trade dynamics to shareholder activism and from corporate social responsibility initiatives to the spread of accountability measures and the impact of corporate sovereignty. This issue brings together the voices of anthropologists, social activists, NGO managers, corporate executives, financial planners, and entrepreneurs. It is the product of a 5-day international symposium held in August 2008 at the School for Advanced Research (SAR) campus in Santa Fe, sponsored by both SAR and the Wenner-Gren Foundation.","[Welker, Marina] Cornell Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Partridge, Damani J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA; [Partridge, Damani J.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Afroamer & African Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA; [Hardin, Rebecca] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Cornell University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Welker, M (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Anthropol, 261 McGraw Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",djpartri@umich.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,153,58,59,2,34,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0011-3204,1537-5382,,CURR ANTHROPOL,Curr.

Practical Implications - We offer suggestions and measures for improving cooperatives' performance by enhancing the human and social capitals of director-generals. Based on China's national conditions, we propose measures to improve director-generals' human and social capitals by the Internal trust, Government policy support, and Business network (IGB) model, which emphasizes establishing a social network of cooperatives' director-generals, accumulating social capital, and promoting cooperative development through internal members, government departments, and commercial organizations.","[Liu, Bin; Li, Zhongbin] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Management, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bin; Li, Zhongbin] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Tourism, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bin] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Jinshan Coll, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University,"Li, ZB (corresponding author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Management, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Li, ZB (corresponding author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Tourism, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.",594383133@qq.com,,,,,,,59,3,3,1,6,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2299-9701,,,INT J MANAG ECON,Int.

The movement includes the county seat, and the cooperative organizations based on the village unit are arranged so as to gradually improve rural governance (cunzhi) and the welfare of the peasants. The movement focuses on the integration of vertical and horizontal resources and promotion of the development and expansion of internal potential (neili) within the cooperatives through the introduction of external factors. To be specific, new rural reconstruction is about the comprehensive reconstruction of the peasants in economic, cultural, social, political, and other fields, which requires the utilization of existing village resources such as religion, clans, institutions (tizhi), and so on, so that former expressions of cooperation will bring about new ones. The breakthrough in Lankao county centers on cultural troupes (wenyi dui) and seniors' associations.

The literature reports that firms are increasingly entering into long-term, high dependency exchanges as a result of increased demand for quality goods, demand for variability of goods, demand for constant innovation, severe price competition and increasing technology costs. These changes are forcing firms to enter into complex relationships with other firms in order to remain competitive. Examples of such relationships are: relational contracting, network organisations, strategic alliances and horizontal co-operation. The increase in number and complexity of these exchanges in an environment characterised by uncertainty has led to the increased interest in the use of obligation contracting. Furthermore, this interest has been reinforced by the changing nature of products being exchanged. More knowledge-based products and information-based modes of production necessitate the sharing of strategically sensitive data. Hence the rise of importance of obligation contracting is not only due to the increased number of complex exchanges in uncertain environments, but also the very nature of the goods being exchanged.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management & Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; Deloitte Consulting, European Supply Chain Management Practice, London, England",Queens University Belfast; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Cousins, PD (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management & Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,,,,,,49,32,32,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-3577,1758-6593,,INT J OPER PROD MAN,Int.

We study if and how farmer cooperatives can build brand equity to drive or support product differentiation. With emphasis on ownership type and product origin, we conduct two choice experiments with cheese and cereal consumers in the United States. The results of our multinomial logit model indicate farmer cooperatives can command a price premium as compared to store brands, but not as much as non-cooperatives. Cheese and cereal consumers also indicate a general willingness to pay for product origin and family ownership attributes, but the effects are not always compatible with farmer cooperatives. Overall, although price premiums for cooperative brands and labels may exist across various product categories, the heterogeneity in willingness to pay estimates for other product attributes is suggestive of the difficulties farmer cooperatives face in pursuit of product differentiation.

To illustrate this problem, we offer a specific case study of the forgotten alternative organizations and marginalized space of a former Finntown alongside the commemorative narratives and practices of capitalist entrepreneur heritage spaces. Extending organization theory on memory and forgetting, we detail how commemoration not only tends to legitimate capitalist forms of organizing, but also excludes alternatives. Finntowns, with their emphasis on cooperative organizations and community, provide a unique opportunity for organization studies to explore commemoration and forgetting in terms of power relations, time, and space. These marginalized spaces contained alternative organizations coexisting and contrasting with dominant capitalist organizations.

To measure the impact of CSR management, the electricity sector implements monitoring processes and models, such as the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which measure contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. This research analyses the strategic management of CSR in the 28 electric cooperatives that market electricity in Spain with the aim of determining their level of commitment to CSR and stakeholder participation in their corporate policies. The analysis is based on the descriptive-exploratory study of the whole population of electric cooperatives. The results indicate that the CSR management of most electric cooperatives is still in an emerging stage within the Value Curve. Importantly, there is a significant percentage of cooperatives that have already advanced towards the consolidating and institutionalized stages. However, most of these social-economy organizations are not developing programs that link their CSR strategies with their priority SDGs and sustainability as a commitment to their community.","[Campillo-Alhama, Concepcion; Igual-Anton, Diego] Univ Alicante, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Dept Commun & Social Psychol, San Vicente Raspeig Rd, Alicante 03690, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Campillo-Alhama, C (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Dept Commun & Social Psychol, San Vicente Raspeig Rd, Alicante 03690, Spain.",concepcion.campillo@ua.es; diego.igual@ua.es,,"Igual Anton, Diego/0000-0002-9354-1986","I3CE Research Network Program for University Teaching of the Education Sciences Institute of the University of Alicante; PROTO-COL Inter-University Network of Collaborative Work in Protocol, Event Management, and Institutional Relations (2020-2021) [5230]","I3CE Research Network Program for University Teaching of the Education Sciences Institute of the University of Alicante; PROTO-COL Inter-University Network of Collaborative Work in Protocol, Event Management, and Institutional Relations (2020-2021)","This research was funded by the I3CE Research Network Program for University Teaching of the Education Sciences Institute of the University of Alicante (call 2020-21).

The Brazilian agribusiness sector presented an accumulated growth rate of 4.28% in the period from January to October 2016, evidencing its importance in resumption of the Brazilian economic growth. The research population is composed by 64 farming cooperatives from Parana. The research is aligned to the Abdel-Kader and Luther (2008) and Guerreiro et al. (2011) studies, whose questionnaires were adapted for this study. To the potential respondents were sent a link and returned 38 valid questionnaires. The data collected were treated using descriptive statistics means, variance and standard deviation. In the surveyed sample 58.6% of the farming cooperatives employ up to 100 employees. The remaining respondents, 13.5% up to 500, 5.4% up to 1000 and 21.6% up to 3000 employees. The findings of this study are in line with those of some previous studies regarding the adoption and use of more traditional accounting practices. The majority of the farming cooperatives studied in Parana use to a higher degree the managerial accounting practices listed in the evolutionary stages 1 and 2 of IFAC (1998), but also using some practices of stages 3 and 4. In relation to the most contemporary tools such as target costing, Economic Value Added (EVA) and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) findings suggest low level of adoption and utilization. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that there is still a paradox between the set of tools available in the literature and those practiced by the organizations.","[Tarifa, Marcelo Resquetti; dos Reis, Luciano Gomes] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Ciencias Contabeis, Rodovia Celso Garcia Cid,Pr 445,Km 380, BR-86057970 Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Almeida, Lauro Brito] Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Av Prefeito Lothario Meissner 632, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Londrina; Universidade Federal do Parana,"Tarifa, MR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Ciencias Contabeis, Rodovia Celso Garcia Cid,Pr 445,Km 380, BR-86057970 Londrina, PR, Brazil.",marcelotarifa@hotmail.com; lucianoreis@uel.br; gbrito@uol.com.br,,,,,,,13,1,1,2,13,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2019,15,1,,,,,67,84,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,HR3FO,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000463022400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Can self-help groups or Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) mitigate the impact of shocks on educational investment? Using nationally representative panel data from Tanzania, I find that educational investment suffers because of income shocks. On a whole, I find that income shock is negatively correlated with educational investment measured in per school-age child educational expenditure. However, I find no strong evidence to suggest that self-help groups and SACCOs buffer against income shocks. This suggests that locally available buffering mechanisms such as self-help groups and SACCOs do not necessarily help households to cushion against income shocks partly because many of the shocks affect most people in a given locality. Therefore, relying solely on the local mitigating mechanisms may not be a good option. This calls for a need to design policies that would enable households to insure themselves beyond their local insurance mechanisms. Public insurance and social safety nets programs may help households to overcome income shocks.","[Mugizi, Francisco M.

This research confirms the versatility of synergy within different conditions and environments, achieving it as a result of being managed. Mapping the synergy in a current environment within the chosen cooperation relations shows that each one contributor of such a relationship builds stronger relation if all cooperation's actors build stronger competitiveness.

A comparison of two cases from IT and medicine shows that cooperatives can be specified by the central organizational characteristics of goal, membership and structure. Moreover, their role in the labor market is discussed. Cooperatives with the goal of a solidarity-based organization of mobility of solo self-employed can be seen as hybrids between interest representation and intermediary organizations, which differ from other labor market organizations and social networks in the social integration of their members.

This, in association with cooperative organization, has brought high economic returns to fishers. Tourism development on the caye has created a new market for lobsters, which has motivated some fishers to harvest undersized, prereproductive lobsters to sell to local restaurants. Data from interviews and observations suggest that this local system of resource management may be threatened because of a focal market for lobsters which has emerged with the growth of tourism at Caye Caulker.

In this context, cooperative organisations-with their emphasis on principles of mutual governance-present models of alternative organisational systems for a post-growth future. This article examines the cooperative sphere to draw out how affect and relationships in cooperatives may radically alter the sense of working democratically. It draws on methods of social dreaming and free association to examine cooperative development in three cases at different developmental stages: in Hamilton, Bermuda; Preston, UK; and Mondragon, Basque Country. It examines evidence of the way relationships and affect may emerge in organisational systems that place a focus on participatory democracy as opposed to hierarchical structures. We draw from intensive work in these cases to consider the distinctive background and contextual features that may be present within cooperative development processes. This article concludes that cooperative working can foster developmental relationships and present distinctive expressions of the affective realm over time.","[Manley, Julian] Univ Cent Lancashire, Ctr SME Dev, Preston, Lancs, England; [Aiken, Mike] Inst Voluntary Act Res, London, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Manley, J (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Ctr SME Dev, Preston, Lancs, England.",jymanley@uclan.ac.uk,,"Manley, Julian/0000-0003-2548-8033",,,,,43,3,3,2,4,PHOENIX PUBL HOUSE,OXFORDSHIRE,"62 BUCKNELL RD, BICESTER, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1474-2780,2044-3765,,ORGAN SOC DYN,Organ.

His detailed knowledge of the strategic structure of IDOA allowed him to choose a new equilibrium. His desire and ability to communicate with every level involved in the implementation of the CCP as well as his considerable autonomy from the governor enabled him to create, articulate, and implement the strategies necessary to change the equilibrium.

Approximately 1,108 farmers were involved, with two-thirds of the case studies focusing on ruminant production and the remainder dealing with cooperative capacity building. Feeding and forage-related needs were the most frequently assessed in the case studies involving smallholders raising small ruminants or cattle, whereas organization-related needs were the most frequently assessed in those involving smallholder livestock cooperatives. Meeting the feed and forage requirements of small ruminants and cattle is the most urgent need for livestock smallholders, but addressing this challenge will be difficult without concurrent control of the breeding season and common diseases as well as implementation of appropriate methods to track and cull unproductive animals. Empowerment of grass-roots organizations, particularly women's cooperatives, through literacy programmes and effective extension outreach could have significant impacts on the improvement of smallholder livestock enterprises.","[Cibils, Andres F.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Anim & Range Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [McGrew, DeAnn] Winrock Int Livestock Res & Training Ctr, Little Rock, AR 72202 USA; [Kassambara, Bara; Sissoko, Bourama] Winrock Int Livestock Res & Training Ctr, Bamako, Mali; [Bengaly, Konimba] Univ Segou, Segou, Mali; [Acharya, Ram N.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",New Mexico State University; New Mexico State University,"Cibils, AF (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Anim & Range Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",acibils@nmsu.edu,,,United States Agency for International Development; New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station,United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station,The authors thank the expert volunteers and Winrock International staff in Little Rock and Bamako.

One primary governance issue relates to the legal form used to perform microfinance activities. The sector deploys various forms including Banks, Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Cooperatives and NGOs, but each of them has unique features that lead to different orders of priorities and to distinct structures and mechanisms to pursue such a dual objective. This study compares the board governance model and the performance of cooperative organizations (COOPs) with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in microfinance. Using data on 352 rated microfinance institutions, the test results show that, compared to NGOs, COOPs have larger boards and a higher number of board meetings. However, NGOs have a greater percentage of international board members. The test on performance reveals that, whereas COOPs are more cost-efficient and charge lower interest rates, NGOs generally perform better in terms of social performance. However, the two organizational types do not perform differently in terms of profitability.","[Djan, Kwame Ohene] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Kumasi, Ghana; [Mersland, Roy] Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Univ Veien 19, N-4630 Kristiansand, Norway",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Agder,"Djan, KO (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Kumasi, Ghana.",kohenedjan@gmail.com; roy.mersland@uia.no,,"Mersland, Roy/0000-0002-6683-2737",,,,,97,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1385-3457,1572-963X,,J MANAG GOV,J.

Managing implies exploring and suggesting alternatives to reach better results. The objective is to make a diagnosis of cultural patterns in the face of structural and management changes in a worker cooperative. The study is valuable because it describes cultural factors which are related to organizational efficiency, revealing the fluctuations of its basic components throughout time, and it opens the possibility of new questions that set tensions and opportunities to be challenged. As a result, it can be observed that being an associate or being an employee leads to different ways of thinking and acting, derived from opposite interests and goals. The experience of this cooperative organization allows to confirm that cultural management prevails over operational management. Basic convictions are held and they set the course of action. Managing the cooperative culture becomes essential in the labour of associates and managers.

The variance of the effect in different sectors, i.e. crop, forestry, husbandry, fishery and services, is investigated. Design/methodology/approach Provincial-level panel data from 2007 to 2017 are used for this study. A linear dynamic panel regression model is estimated using multiple estimation methods, i.e. the generalized method of moments (GMMs), fixed-effect model and ordinary least squares (OLS) are applied. Findings The empirical analyses indicate that the role of the government is important for the development of farmer cooperatives but limited in some specific aspects. First, the coverage of financial support is positively associated with the growth of cooperative population and membership size, but the strength of financial support, measured by the total amount of financial support divided by local agricultural gross domestic product (GDP), has no statistically significant effects on the development of cooperatives. Second, financial support does not exhibit significant influence on the revenue of cooperatives. Third, the magnitude of the effect of government support on cooperative development is heterogeneous across different sectors. Originality/value The research study adds to the institutional economics literature on the association between institutional environment and organization development by focusing on a particular and an important type of organization, i.e. farmer cooperatives. It is one of the attempts and a most extensive study to empirically investigate the role of financial support in the development of farmer cooperatives.","[Liang, Qiao] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yining] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yining] Shannxi Int Trust Co Ltd, Xian, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xinxin] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Jin, Songqing] Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Zhejiang University; Fudan University; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Michigan State University,"Xu, YN (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Xu, YN (corresponding author), Shannxi Int Trust Co Ltd, Xian, Peoples R China.",liangqiao2323@zju.edu.cn; meggiexyn@163.com; xinxinwang1985@yeah.net; jins@msu.edu,"Wang, Xin/HZL-4695-2023; Wang, Xin/JCE-2009-2023; Wang, Xiaoqiang/IQS-3727-2023; Wang, Xinhua/ISR-8520-2023; Wang, Xin/AAN-8435-2021","Wang, Xin/0000-0002-4457-7376; Wang, Xin/0000-0002-4457-7376; Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863; Jin, Songqing/0000-0001-8514-7930","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY19G030030]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71903178, 71773108]",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (grant no.

In this case study, we examined how policy changes in China over the past 60 years have influenced indigenous resource management institutions designed to manage common pool pastoral systems in eastern Inner Mongolia. Based on semi-structured interviews (n = 91), focus group discussions (64 participants involved), and participant observation, we found that for over half a century rescaling efforts by the Chinese government shifted the focus to national level development planning, which led to the degradation of indigenous institutions that managed common pool pastoral systems in the region.

The purpose of this article was to develop a theoretical framework for the development of women social entrepreneurs in Japan. There were two guiding questions in this study: How and in what ways women social entrepreneurship are developed in Japan? and What life events affect the values and beliefs that drive them to take authentic entrepreneurial careers for social change? The Solution We explored the connection between women social entrepreneurship, authentic leadership, and transformative learning theories in the context of Japan through an extensive literature review. The proposed theoretical framework could be used to show the role of critical reflection in face of triggering life events and factors that support or hinder in becoming women social entrepreneurs. The Stakeholders We focused on Japanese women whose social enterprises aim for social benefits operating through a variety of forms including not-for-profits (NPOs), small businesses, cooperative organizations, and worker collectives.","[Nakamura, Yoshie Tomozumi] George Washington Univ, Human & Org Learning Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Horimoto, Mayuko] Tokai Univ, Ctr Liberal Arts, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Japan",George Washington University; Tokai University,"Nakamura, YT (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, 2134 G St NW,Room 118, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",yoshienakamura@gwu.edu,"Nakamura, Yoshie Tomozumi/AAN-9132-2020",,,,,,43,2,2,3,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1523-4223,1552-3055,,ADV DEV HUM RESOUR,Adv.

The purpose of this paper is to explore variability in the financial performance of the largest 1,000 US farmer cooperatives with emphasis on efficiency, productivity, and leverage. Design/methodology/approach - Cooperative performance is analyzed by means of the extended DuPont identity, an accounting tool which decomposes return on equity into five ratios of efficiency, productivity, and leverage. The extended DuPont identity is applied empirically with quantile regression, which allows estimation of the statistical interrelationship of the DuPont components across the full response distribution. Findings - Per the results, variability in the financial performance of US farmer cooperatives is for the most part associated with the operating profit margin, which confirms prior findings of cost inefficiency in the empirical literature. Therefore, US farmer cooperatives may improve financial performance by emphasizing sales and operating costs. Specifically, recommendations include placing emphasis on bargaining power, product differentiation, and scale economies. Supply cooperatives may also consider issuing non-qualified equity and securing long-term debt access as additional possibilities to improve financial performance. Originality/value - The empirical application of the extended DuPont identity with quantile regression facilitates a novel investigation of cooperative performance by placing emphasis on the efficiency, productivity, and leverage of cooperatives with various degrees of performance.","[Grashuis, Jasper] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Grashuis, J (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",grashuisj@missouri.edu,,"Grashuis, Jasper/0000-0002-5075-4439",,,,,49,20,23,3,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive dataset comprised of 410 paired vegetable producers in China is applied. Propensity score matching (PSM) estimation method is used to control for the selection bias problem. Findings The empirical results indicate that contracting farming does not have significant effect on yield or profit of vegetable production, but promote producers to obtain quality certification. In comparison, cooperative membership has positive effects on the yield, profit and quality certification of producers. Additionally, cooperatives generate positive spillover effects on members' farm and non-farm income, though the results are sensitive to unobserved factors. The inclusion of spillover effects helps to find out the potential unobserved effects which are neglected by most studies and design better policies to promote the development of agricultural companies and farmer cooperatives. Originality/value First, empirical evidence is provided for theories regarding the roles of different supply chain coordination modes on producers. Second, the analysis on evaluating the effects of supply chain coordination also considers the spillover effect on the farming of other products and even non-farm work of involved producers.

The many state organizations that were previously involved in providing water management services in the drinking water, hydropower and irrigation sectors have been consolidated into autonomous and accountable private, public or cooperative organizations, supported by an improving legal framework and an emerging regulatory capacity. This process has already led to improvements in operational performance. To activate overall water resources management, the Water Resources Management Agency (WRMA) and its five River Basin Management Organizations (BMOs) were recently established under the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP), which has a broad natural resources mandate. In this paper, it is argued that the current single biggest challenge of the MNP is to revitalize water resources monitoring, water use permitting and enforcement, which will be essential for future basin planning and management. This will require that the MNP streamline cooperation among its various monitoring and enforcement agencies and the WRMA/BMOs. At the same time, financial mechanisms need to be designed to finance these basic water resources management needs, so that they are sustainable.

Drawing on qualitative research on two Mondragon multinational co-ops based on longitudinal data and in-depth interviews, we address the dilemmas raised by the multinationalization of co-ops through the establishment of subsidiaries abroad, and show the tensions surrounding the 'cooperativization' of foreign subsidiaries, that is to say, the reproduction of the cooperative organizational formula and the transfer of its idiosyncratic policies and practices to foreign subsidiaries. The main finding of the research is that, behind the instrumentalization of various institutional barriers by the managerial technostructure of the parent co-ops to justify the non-cooperativization of foreign subsidiaries, lie factors stemming from headquarters-subsidiary power relations, as well as from core co-op owner-members looking to protect their own interests. Indeed, a clear dissociation has been found between the Mondragon corporate discourse about the promotion of participation and democracy overseas, and the real practices that are operational within the foreign subsidiaries. The article also draws some practical implications for multinational co-ops wishing to extend the cooperative model to their overseas subsidiaries.","[Bretos, Ignacio] Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Errasti, Anjel] Univ Basque Country, Onati Plaza 1, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Basque Country,"Bretos, I (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",ibretos@unizar.es; a.errasti@ehu.es,"Bretos, Ignacio/AAQ-5137-2021; Errasti, Anjel/GWM-7714-2022","Bretos, Ignacio/0000-0002-4941-2028; errasti, anjel/0000-0001-9245-4293",'Social Economy and Cooperative Law' research group of the GEZKI institute in the University of the Basque Country [GIU17/052],'Social Economy and Cooperative Law' research group of the GEZKI institute in the University of the Basque Country,The authors acknowledge financial support from the 'Social Economy and Cooperative Law' research group of the GEZKI institute [GIU17/052] in the University of the Basque Country.,,67,7,9,3,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

The presence of microbial agents, toxic animal and plant products and chemical contamination remain because of the existence of small and dispersed farmers, who are not educated to use agricultural inputs correctly. This inability raises the issue of safety control in the agricultural sector. This study proposes that cooperatives' self-inspection of agricultural products before they enter the market can better organize small farmers to utilize a standardized production and safety management system. Therefore, we attempt to explore the factors that influence farmer cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. An Ordered Logistic Regression Model is employed to estimate the factors that influence cooperatives' choices of inspection frequency. The results show that the respondents expressed a medium to high level of implementing self-inspection but a lower level of concern in testing products by batch. The regression results indicate that subjective norms from the social environment, the perceived behavioral control of managers, ability and rules including input management, production documentation, and social demographic variables, significantly affect cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. The future implementation of safety inspection depends on the extent to which subjective norms, ability, and internal rules can improve agri-product safety in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These include institutional pluralism, institutional logics, competing rationalities and pluralistic contexts. The French pragmatic sociologists Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thevenot have contributed to this line of research with a sophisticated theoretical framework of orders of worth, which has been applied in an increasing number of empirical studies. This article explores how the order of worth framework has been applied to empirical studies of organizations. First, I summarize the basic ideas of the framework, stressing the aspects of special relevance for studies of organizations. Second, I review the empirical studies focusing on the coexistence of competing orders of worth in organizations showing that the order of worth framework primarily has been related to three main themes in organizational research: non-profit and co-operative organizations, inter-organizational co-operation, and organizational change. Third, I discuss how the pragmatic, process-oriented aspect of the research program, focusing on the intertwining of values and action in various forms of 'justification work', has been translated into empirical studies. I argue that even if highly interesting empirical studies have begun to appear on the pragmatic aspects of the order of worth program, empirical studies of 'justification work' may be a potentially very promising focus for future empirical studies.","Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun Business & Informat Technol, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Jagd, S (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun Business & Informat Technol, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",jagd@ruc.dk,,,,,,,68,107,108,0,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4310,1461-7137,,EUR J SOC THEORY,Eur.

Design/methodology/approach - Data collection occurred in 26 states and the Federal District of Brazil. There was validation of 171 questionnaires answered at the strategic and tactical levels in the context of cooperatives in 13 sectors of Brazil's economy. Structural equation modeling was used as an application to verify the data with the use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings - The results made it possible to verify the relationship between SMC and the social and environmental performance. The coefficient found for the relationship between SMC and economic-financial performance also had a positive effect. Practical implications - The research results provide evidence that SMC is directly related to the economic-financial and social-environmental performance of cooperative organizations.

First, pay-for-delay conduct has been harmful for pharmaceuticals customers. After ten years of litigation that divided circuit courts, the Supreme Court decreed that payments to generic drug sellers by the patent holders of the brand equivalent that are aimed at delaying entry are illegal, but did so under a structured rule-of-reason approach. EU competition authorities treat such payments as per se civil infractions. Second, until court decisions made in 2011-2014, the reach of the Capper-Volstead Act and the legality of pay-for-delay conduct in the drug industry were in doubt. In 2015, most federal circuits now clearly agree that, at a minimum, acreage restrictions by marketing cooperatives are per se illegal.

The concept of coopetition continues to gain attention as global competition increases. However, the analysis of the influence of institutional elements on coopetition has been limited. This study bridges this gap. We use a case study to examine the coopetition framework among competing Japanese airlines formed to negotiate with major institutional elements: a monopolistic supplier and a government regulatory authority. First, this study identifies the mechanisms through which institutions promote coopetition. The findings point to coercive isomorphism and external hazard as influential institutional mechanisms; through coercive isomorphism, the shared benefits increase, and the cost of cooperation is reduced; through external hazard, organisations are encouraged to unite, and coopetition is promoted. Second, the study identifies the mechanisms through which organisations in coopetition enhance their bargaining power. Specifically, we find two sources of enhanced bargaining power: intensified pressure as a larger group and improved persuasiveness with consensus. These findings have important implications for the theory and management of co-operative organisations, such as for the interaction between co-operatives and institutions, since the coopetition framework we analysed has characteristics close to the values and principles of co-operatives.","[Nakanishi, Yoshinobu] Nagasaki Univ, Fac Econ, 4-2-1 Katafuchi, Nagasaki 8508506, Japan",Nagasaki University,"Nakanishi, Y (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Fac Econ, 4-2-1 Katafuchi, Nagasaki 8508506, Japan.",nakanishiy@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [16K03812]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03812] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16K03812.,,53,6,6,3,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

While many analyses have blamed the 'tragedy of the commons' and government mismanagement for environmental destruction, this paper provides a case study of resin tapping in Honduras which formulates the hypotheses that common property regimes can be successful and that economic liberalization policies may be detrimental to community-level resource schemes. Over half of the 6000 farmer-resin tappers in Honduras are organized into forty-six co-operatives that market the tree sap, wood and other forest products. These activities combine the twin goals of community-based forest preservation and income generation. Established legally in 1974, the tapping groups have expanded to include a variety of organizational and technical arrangements. The two co-operatives of Villa Santa and San Juan de Ojojona demonstrate contrasting histories, ecological endowments and economic outcomes. Currently the Honduran resin tappers are facing problems over their access to forest resources, the fluctuating profitability of extractive activities and the stability of the co-operative organization. These three issues are relevant to a variety of community-based environmental activities, and the lessons of the Honduran experience can be applied to analyse the processes of environmental degradation and community response elsewhere in the Third World.",,,"STANLEY, DL (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,NAT RESOURCE ECON & AGR DEV,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,,"Stanley, Denise/0000-0003-1992-074X",,,,,30,7,7,0,2,BLACKWELL PUBL LTD,OXFORD,"108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX4 1JF",0012-155X,,,DEV CHANGE,Dev.

In the 1980s, pastureland was administratively allocated based on household size. The subsequent changes in socioeconomic and new household characteristics suggest that adjustment is needed for more efficient land use. This study reviewed the recent progress of the rental market and investigated the herdsmen's behaviours regarding grassland market transactions in Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia. The economic assumption is that there exists a variation in values by household for each given parcel of land, which drives land transfer to users who can generate higher values. Each household is characterised by its initial pasture landholding, herding facilities and demographics. But the gain from the transfer must be deducted from the transaction costs, and cooperative membership can significantly reduce the transaction costs. An econometric model is developed and tested with data collected from household surveys in the Xilingol League. The results indicate that household size is the most significant variable for land transfer in the long run. Herdsmen have been dynamically adjusting herding equipment and pasture landholdings, allocating labour between herding and non-herding activities in response to these changes in society. Cooperative organisation was found to be significant in facilitating land transfer due to its role in reducing transaction costs. Higher quality land with higher rent is also found to be more likely to transfer since the percentage of the transaction cost is lower than lower quality land.","[Zhang, Meiyan] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Hohhot 010018, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Meiyan; Zhang, Lizhong] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yaoqi; Xu, Yecheng] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Chen, Jiquan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; Beijing Forestry University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Michigan State University,"Zhang, LZ (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YQ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",zhangy3@auburn.edu; myz_2002@eyou.com,"Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009; Chen, Jing/AAD-4768-2020; Zhang, Meiyan/HSF-8161-2023","Chen, Jiquan/0000-0003-0761-9458; Chen, Jing/0000-0002-8682-1293;",'Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH)' Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) [1313761]; ICER; Directorate For Geosciences [1523628] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,'Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH)' Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ICER; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We would like to thank Professor Henry Kinnucan, Dr Anwar Hussain and two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

Based upon examination of the foundational TQM texts and of 25 implementation guides, we show how the language of 'empowerment' and 'self-management', central to the TQM mission, is often used in equivocal ways that compromise the meaning of these concepts as they were originally developed and used by radically egalitarian grassroots organizations. We also show in several respects how TQM's organizational changes may further perpetuate inequality among workers. By distilling the key ideal-typical features of the total quality organization and comparing them with the ideal-type characteristics of the machine-based bureaucracy and of the egalitarian-democratic organization, we bring into sharp relief how they are not the same. In bringing to the TQM literature the practices and standards developed over a 150-year history by genuinely egalitarian cooperative organizations, we are able to show the profound differences in form that prevail despite their parallel language. Should TQM practitioners wish to adopt the substance of these shared control methods, they would do well to learn from the examples of the grassroots organizations that pioneered these empowerment methods.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Rothschild, J (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,"Ollilainen, Marjukka/AAL-4601-2020","Ollilainen, Marjukka/0000-0002-1851-8540",,,,,89,27,27,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0143-831X,1461-7099,,ECON IND DEMOCRACY,Econ.

One of the major policy adjustments is to strengthen the supply of public goods in rural areas and set up the rural cooperative medical system (RCMS) financed by both governments and farmers. The purpose of this paper is to outline the background, recent developments, achievements and problems of the RCMS and help people to understand the RCMS in China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a time approach, meaning the paper is organized by initiate background, system framework design, experiment and extension, achievement, problems and discussion about the RCMS development process. Findings - The Central Government intended to establish a new medical system in rural areas, so that farmers could protect themselves if they got sick. The paper finds that, with the help of the government, farmers have gradually accepted the medical cooperation system. The RCMS has rapidly been extended, and forms a basic medical security net for rural residents The RCMS has achieved the initial goals of the policy reform mitigating farmers' financial burden, increasing the number of visits to doctors, and reducing the cost of the RCMS. However, there are still some pending issues such as fund-raising, monitoring-efficiency, and medical targets that need to be solved. Originality/value - This paper is a general review, which provides a brief and general image of the Chinese RCMS and helps people to understand the RCMS in China.","[He Xiurong] Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang Zhongyi] Minist Agr, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"He, XR (corresponding author), Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,7,6,6,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In contrast, media accounts of co-operatives are relatively scarce, particularly, in the United Kingdom, where business reporting usually focuses on capitalist narratives, with alternatives routinely marginalised until a scandal pushes them into the public eye. This article analyses media coverage of the United Kingdom's Co-operative Bank (2011-2015), tracing its transformation from an unremarkable presence on the UK high street to preferred bidder for Lloyds Bank branches and its subsequent near collapse. The article charts changes in reporting and media interest in the bank through five discursive frames: member and customer service; standard financial reporting; human interest, personality-driven journalism; the public relations machine; and political coverage. Our analysis discusses three points: the politicisation of the story through covert and overt political values; simplification and sensationalism; and media hegemony. We argue that although moments of crisis provide an opening for re-evaluating the dominant reporting model, established frames tend to reassert themselves as a story develops. This produces good copy that reflects the interests of the publishers but does not extend understanding of co-operative organisations. Thus, the article identifies the role of the media in delegitimising organisations with alternative governance structures, thereby promoting ideological and economic conformity.","[Mangan, Anita] Keele Univ, Management, Keele, Staffs, England; [Byrne, Aidan] Univ Wolverhampton, English, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England",Keele University; University of Wolverhampton,"Mangan, A (corresponding author), Keele Univ, Keele Management Sch, Darwin Bldg, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.",a.m.l.mangan@keele.ac.uk,,"Mangan, Anita/0000-0002-3366-7536",,,,,40,3,3,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,NOV,2018,25,6,,,,,794,811,,10.1177/1350508418763276,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350508418763276,,,18,Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HA5QK,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000450330800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this case study, we consider how two decades of pilot projects for integrated conservation and sustainable development (ICDPs) variously influenced forest governance across three agrarian reform settlements in northwestern Mato Grosso state. The analysis combines: i) remote sensing of deforestation from 1997-2015; ii) land use and economic data for individual settler farms and cooperatives; iii) settlers' perceptions regarding legitimacy and relevance of state policies, including land use regulations under the Brazilian Forest Code. Deforestation across settlements varied in association with synergies or lack thereof between policy instruments and socially embedded rules organizing economic alternatives to the dominant regional pattern of cattle ranching. In two of the settlements deforestation surpassed or was approaching 80% of their total area. In the third settlement deforestation stabilized at 45%, corresponding with the initiation of ICDP support for a pilot project focused on Brazil nut extractivism to consolidate community management of the settlement's collective forest reserve. The latter process involved a 'policy mix' or sequence of overlapping components: technical assistance, cooperative organization, environmental licensing, infrastructure, equitable contracts with surrounding indigenous communities and market development. Comparing with the two counterfactual cases, we suggest a framework for analysis of systemic socio-ecological change in settlements in the Brazilian Amazon, and reconsider the role of ICDPs in landscape approaches to environmental governance in tropical forests.

Consequently, cooperatives studies have tended to examine economic outcomes, such as productivity and job security, comparing them to conventional business firms. Nevertheless, cooperatives are membership associations and have organizational characteristics in common with other types of voluntary associations. Furthermore, one explicit organizational principle of cooperatives is concern for community, and their contributions to the community have been covered frequently by media. Therefore, it is imperative to examine cooperative members' community engagement, and compare it to other types of association members. Using a national sample of Venezuelans, the relationships between association memberships and community involvement were compared across different types of associations. The results showed that cooperative members had a higher likelihood of being involved in community matters than those from other types of associations. Although the Venezuelan cooperatives have received vast support from the Chavez government for community development, this result can have an implication on the cooperatives' organizational identity as those who provide members with resources necessary for civic engagement beyond the organizations.","[Tak, Sangdong] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Sociol, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Tak, S (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Sociol, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",stak@gradcenter.cuny.edu,,,,,,,70,4,4,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

The article draws experiences from the rapidly emerging FC field in China. Three cases are selected to cross check findings from them and innovation journey analysis is used within each case to understand FCs' engagement in innovation processes. The findings show that FCs cover a wide range of knowledge intermediation and innovation intermediation functions identified by the literature. FCs recognize the importance to connect technical, social and economic dimensions of farming practice and provide corresponding services to link farmers to relevant actors, like extension agencies, research institutes and supermarkets. Though they mainly work through bilateral relationships as opposed to acting as a systemic intermediary, they could take the role of coordinator in the service system and bridge the gap between the research and policy system and everyday farming practice, especially in the absence of a systemic coordinator. However, their legitimacy as intermediary might be challenged due to the potential conflicts with governments, market actors or their members, and their local position may provide insufficient clout for developing durable relationships with relevant actors.

It analyzes the relationship between vertical and horizontal structures, and the economic sustainability of different structure combinations. Design/methodology/approach The paper develops a conceptual framework to predict coordination structures as a function of transaction-cost characteristics, compares predictions for the Malian cereals market to empirical evidence using 15 case studies, and then analyzes structure combinations. Findings Asymmetric scale between farmers and buyers; uncertainty in production, prices, policy, and contract enforcement; and quality and quantity debasement lead to selections of structures with high levels of control. Vertical and horizontal structures demonstrate a complementary relationship in certain core coordination roles, while exhibiting substitutability in the provision of other coordination activities. The marketing cooperative and marketing contract pairing is the most prevalent combination. Research limitations/implications The conceptual framework is useful for explaining the selection of coordination structures, and can be applied in other contexts to strengthen external validity. Originality/value The framework facilitates predictions and explanation of both VC and HC structures, with empirical application on a country and value chains receiving little attention in the literature.","[Vroegindewey, Ryan; Theriault, Veronique; Staatz, John] Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Vroegindewey, R (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",vroegin2@msu.edu,,,,,,,50,9,9,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-0839,2044-0847,,J AGRIBUS DEV EMERG,J.

Scholars have mainly focused on the organizational integration of three sub-systems: production/operations, marketing/sales, and R&D. This study explored the organizational integration of the organizational unit in charge of the firm's IT and information systems: the IT function. This construct has five key dimensions: integration of the IT function with top management, business units, customers, non-IT suppliers, and IT providers. Analysis of data from 236 (r)esponses to a survey questionnaire confirmed that all five dimensions positively influence the firm's market performance. The contribution of the firm's information systems to both competitive and cooperative organizational capabilities strongly mediates this relationship. This research model high-lights the complementary explanatory power of Lawrence and Lorsch's (1967) theory of organizational integration, the business-IT alignment literature, and the resource-based view (RBV). The results suggest that the more firms evolve towards IT-enabled business environments, the more they need IT managers to be socially embedded in these environments and to contribute actively to the overall knowledge-based organizational integration of the system.

Data were examined through a content analysis process following a combined deductive and inductive approach. Findings Sustainability is spread driven by market pressure, mainly through the diffusion of technical information, either by lead organisations enablers or inter-organisational relations. The authors found that the type and structure of organisations impact the source of power (mediated or non-mediated) and level of mutual dependence between buyer and supplier. For instance, suppliers that hold a strategic position use direct governance mechanisms, which, in turn, lessens the power imbalance in regard to the lead organisation. The authors found in the analysis, a close relation between governance mechanisms and the spread of sustainability, which is ultimately based on strong SC relationships. Practical implications By recognising their role and the contingencies in spreading sustainability standards along the SC, managers of lead organisations can better design their relationships as well as create strategies to increase their supply chain sustainability (SCS) performance. Originality/value This paper contributes to the underexplored issue of how sustainability standards are spread throughout SCs in Latin America. Also, it shows how different types of SC rely on governance mechanisms that foster SCS.","[Silva, Minelle E.] Excelia Business Sch, La Rochelle, France; [Dias, Gustavo Picanco] Univ Fed Piaui, Picos, Brazil; [Gold, Stefan] Univ Kassel, Fac Econ & Business, Kassel, Germany",Universidade Federal do Piaui; Universitat Kassel,"Silva, ME (corresponding author), Excelia Business Sch, La Rochelle, France.",silvam@excelia-group.com; gustavopicanco@hotmail.com; gold@uni-kassel.de,"Silva, Minelle E./W-2491-2019","Dias, Gustavo/0000-0002-5469-9158; Silva, Minelle/0000-0003-2074-6478; Gold, Stefan/0000-0001-9945-742X",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Brazil) [426155/2018-1],National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This reserch project was funded by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Brazil), Grant number 426155/2018-1.",,74,16,16,5,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0957-4093,1758-6550,,INT J LOGIST MANAG,Int.

The different approaches are due to the multiple perspectives suggested by a phenomenon multi-faceted in itself and that can be observed starting from different premises and purposes. Starting from these considerations, it seemed us appropriate to analyse the cooperative forms of enterprise focussing on the economic aspects of the production of goods and services, carried out in enterprises in which the management is entrusted to bodies different from those allocating the financial capital. Taking this into account, the first part of this work will focus on the definition of the cooperative forms of enterprise in general economic theory and in business theory. On the basis of the theoretical-conceptual profiles of reference, this study proposes an interpretation of the cooperative enterprise representing a reference model of the economic production that can at the same time increase both the economic development and the wealth of a whole community. With specific regard to this latter aspect, the second part of this work will focus on two cooperatives from Puglia, structured as community-based cooperatives, which tend to associate the pursuit of economic goals with the social and economic development of the local communities in which they operate. Through the illustration of two case studies (the community-based cooperatives Melpignano and Jemma) this paper aims to highlight the potential of community-based cooperatives for the support and the economic and social development of local area and its residents.","[Adamo, Stefano; Giaccari, Francesco; Fasiello, Roberta] Univ Salento, Dept Econ Management Math & Stat, Salento, Italy",University of Salento,"Adamo, S (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Econ Management Math & Stat, Salento, Italy.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,EUROMED PRESS,MARSEILLE CEDEX 9,"RUE ANTOINE BOURDELLE, DOMAINE DE LUMINY BP 921, MARSEILLE CEDEX 9, 13 288, FRANCE",,,978-9963-711-27-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,31,43,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC2IP,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000350976900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The perception is now commonly held that it is necessary to radically rethink the entire set up of the institutional school towards a more flexible, adaptable and co-operative organization (Irgens and Jensen in Skolen som kunnskapsorganisasjon. Utdanning, nr.3,1. februar, 2008). This paper explores an empirical case, where a school is implementing a device called 'flexible timetables' in an attempt to depart from former fixed structures and private teaching practices. By combining process thought and liminality theory, the paper offers a theoretical framework for understanding some of the dynamics and unintended consequences of this transformation process. In so doing the paper calls attention to some important limits to the vision of flexibility and openness that informs this program of organisational change and subjectivity. Flexible timetables are conceptualized as a liminal affective technology (Stenner and Moreno-Gabriel in Subjectivity 6(3):229-253, https://doi.org/10.1057/sub.2013.9, 2013), designed to disrupt structures supporting former institutional practices, and to engender circumstances that are describable in terms of liminal experience. We use the concept of liminal affectivity to describe the collective atmosphere of ambivalence and volatility that is summoned through the intervention. We also draw attention to certain unexpected side effects, as when the participants experience themselves both paralysed by the ensuing paradoxes, and captured in dynamics of polarisation (Greco and Stenner in Theory Psychol 27(2):147-166, https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354317 693120, 2017). The paper proposes the concept liminal affective leadership wherein the use of the technology is framed as a continuously sensitive balancing of the volatile liminal affectivity that it induces.","[Bjergkilde, Dorethe] Univ Coll Absalon, Ctr Management & Leisure, Trekroner Forskerpk 4, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Stenner, Paul] Open Univ, Sch Psychol & Counselling, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Gardiner 2 Bldg,Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Open University - UK,"Bjergkilde, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Absalon, Ctr Management & Leisure, Trekroner Forskerpk 4, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",dobj@pha.dk; paul.stenner@open.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,3,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1755-6341,1755-635X,,SUBJECTIVITY,Subjectivity,JUN,2021,14,1-2,,,,,53,72,,10.1057/s41286-021-00115-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41286-021-00115-2,,JUN 2021,20,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,SV0GS,,Green Accepted,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000658079900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, an exploratory study has been undertaken to provide empirical insight into Bangladeshi coastal shrimp farmers' risk perceptions and risk management responses. Data from our study show that 95% of farmers have no formal training in shrimp aquaculture. Shrimp farmers' cooperative societies operate in only 13.3% of the studied areas and only 15% of shrimp farmers are involved with these cooperative societies. The results reveal that shrimp diseases, price and availability of quality shrimp seeds, exploitation by intermediaries and uncertainty about the future demand for shrimp in foreign markets are perceived as the most important sources of risk. On the other hand, prevention of disease, timely supply of shrimp seeds, elimination of middlemen from the supply chain and farm management training are considered among the best methods to manage the risks in the shrimp-farming business. We also observe some disparities in farmers' perceptions. For instance, farmers mentioned that removal of influence of middlemen from supply chain is essential for the betterment of their business. However, they did not consider market monitoring, direct contract with processors and improved marketing facilities as important risk management strategies, although these factors play a significant role in reducing the influence of intermediaries and private money lenders.","Univ So Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Ahsan, DA (corresponding author), Univ So Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark.",daahsan@yahoo.com,,"Ahsan, Dewan/0000-0001-5673-153X",,,,,50,60,64,1,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

Exploring the basic principles of worker-owned organizations in practice,ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cooperative organizations; cooperative principles; decoupling; Mondragon; worker-owned organizations,MONDRAGON; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; DEMOCRACY,"The Mondragon Cooperative Experience has been one of the worker-owned alternative organizations that has received the most attention in the academic world. Despite its economic success, this experience has also been wrought with its own share of tensions and internal paradoxes. Surprisingly, the perspective of worker-member-owners in the analysis of those inconsistencies in Mondragon has been given very little prominence. Similarly, the equivalence between the formal policies defined in that experience and the day-to-day activity has been widely taken for granted in the literature. This article aims to fill this gap and contribute to the literature by analyzing the extent to which Mondragon's basic cooperative principles are applied in the daily practice from the perspective of worker-member-owners. To that end, in-depth interviews were conducted with worker-member-owners of Mondragon outside their working environment. An interpretative analysis provides evidence of a decoupling of cooperative principles from the workers' daily activity. Furthermore, a tacit and non-formal principle frequently surfaces in the interviews: the principle of the primacy of secure membership and guaranteed employment. This seems to be the most solid tie that binds members to their organization, in a context with growing individualization and precarious employment conditions, together with a ubiquitous managerial discourse that encourages shallow forms of workplace participation. This work contributes to the broader field of organizational theory and sheds light on the dissociation process in formal policies of organizations governed by alternative founding principles. It also tries to contribute to the study of the sustainability of such alternative organizations.","[Heras-Saizarbitoria, Inaki] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, San Sebastian 20018, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Heras-Saizarbitoria, I (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, EUE Empresariales, Dept Management, Plaza Onati 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain.",iheras@ehu.es,"Heras-Saizarbitoria, Iñaki/ABB-6290-2020","Heras-Saizarbitoria, Iñaki/0000-0002-9337-1374",,,,,95,77,78,1,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,SEP,2014,21,5,,,SI,,645,665,,10.1177/1350508414537623,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350508414537623,,,21,Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AQ2OV,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000342627600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The central member position is due to the cooperative being an organization of, by, and for members. Furthermore, the presence of a central position is due to members having a function as owners and users of cooperative service. Member education, as one of the cooperative principles, is necessary because the members' knowledge of the cooperative will support the role or central position of the members. Efforts to implement member education, among others, are implemented by means of best practice development. Best practice (dictionary.com) is a procedure or set of procedures that is preferred or considered as a standard within an organization, industry, etc. Best practice development is based on organizational management experience. This research was conducted on Multipurpose Cooperative Makmur Sejati Malang. Analysis of information from key informants is done by triangulation analysis. The findings of the research indicate that the analysis of best practices is in line with the stages of development of cooperative organizations as part of member education. Best practice, in establishing Rukun Ibu for example, gives awareness to members to avoid lending activities. In addition, best practice at development stage is emphasized on member education. The fact that the fulfillment of obligations is executed by the 12th, as well as the loan service starting on the 13th of each month, instills an understanding of the need to balance the fulfillment of obligations and the utilization of rights as members of the cooperative.","[Sutrisno; Prameka, Adelia Shabrina; Wardani, Shanti Ike; Wahyuni, Fitri] Univ Negeri Malang, Fak Ekon, Malang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Malang,"Sutrisno (corresponding author), Univ Negeri Malang, Fak Ekon, Malang, Indonesia.",sutrisno.fe@um.ac.id,"Prameka, Adelia Shabrina/AAR-9520-2020; Wardani, Shanti Ike/AAB-8099-2021","Prameka, Adelia Shabrina/0000-0002-2942-5729",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,289,307,,10.18502/kss.v3i3.1890,http://dx.doi.org/10.18502/kss.v3i3.1890,,,19,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM5LX,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000465229600021,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the incumbents can defend their positions and reap the benefits of multi-sided market structures by establishing a platform business model themselves. We examine a case study of the Austrian News Agency (APA), which gradually formulated a strategy that resulted in a platform-based business model. Platform features were strategized and innovated over time and in phases, with the intent of creating value for customers on both sides of the platform. We found that APA's platform transformation was enabled by a visionary value proposition backed by a trusted institution's legitimacy and a co-operative organizational model that provided added incentives for the participating news media companies. The strategy and the business model emerged on the basis of external developments and internal realizations concerning the feasibility of the new platform strategy. Based on our results, we develop a framework for an incumbent strategy formation process towards a platform business model. This framework demonstrates the incumbent organization's emergent, as well as deliberate, strategic ability to introduce platform features into its business model, based on unique intra-firm synergies with established parts of the business, and highlighting a potential for incumbent advantage.","[Jaaskelainen, Atte; Ritala, Paavo] LUT Univ, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland; [Yanatma, Servet] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Media & Commun, London, England",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Jääskeläinen, A (corresponding author), LUT Univ, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland.",atte.sakari@gmail.com,,"Ritala, Paavo/0000-0002-8525-4610; Jaaskelainen, Atte/0000-0003-4708-4371; Yanatma, Servet/0000-0001-8650-5373","Media-alan tutkimussaatio (Media Research Foundation), Finland; Jyllands-Postens Fond, Denmark; LSE (Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund), UK","Media-alan tutkimussaatio (Media Research Foundation), Finland; Jyllands-Postens Fond, Denmark; LSE (Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund), UK","This research was funded by the Media-alan tutkimussaatio (Media Research Foundation), Finland; Jyllands-Postens Fond, Denmark; and LSE (Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund), UK.",,81,4,4,7,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Lean Six Sigma is one of the best techniques which has been used for more than two decades to make quality products by reducing defects. The current scenario for the development puts more effort towards sustainability, and hence stakeholders and consumers are all demanding for sustainable products. Nowadays, an integrated approach of sustainability and Lean Six Sigma has started to gain attention from researchers, which includes the financial, environmental, and societal factors of the organisation. The present study is a case study-based implementation of a hybrid framework of Sustainable Lean Six Sigma for manufacturing organisations. Through literature review and experts' opinions, a total of thirty-four barriers and twenty-nine solutions were identified. For the ranking of barriers, the Best-worst method technique has been applied, and the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment technique is used for prioritisation of the solutions. The top barriers found out as lack of top management attitude towards sustainability concept, lack of project plans, techniques, and standard practices, lack of continuous improvement culture. The top solutions found are management participation to Sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation, provide consulting to top management regarding Sustainable Lean Six Sigma benefits, develop a cooperative organisational culture. The obtained results are expected to be helpful to the managers for the implementation of the Sustainable Lean Six Sigma in their organisations. Hence, the present study will provide valuable insights to the researchers and practitioners.","[Parmar, Pranay Sureshbhai; Desai, Tushar N.] Sardar Vallabhbhai Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Surat 395007, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology,"Parmar, PS (corresponding author), Sardar Vallabhbhai Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Surat 395007, India.",pranayparmar7@gmail.com,"Parmar, Pranay Sureshbhai/ABD-3135-2020",,,,,,73,13,13,2,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1939-7038,1939-7046,,INT J SUSTAIN ENG,Int.

Design/methodology/approach Primary data were solicited from the cooperatives and members of cooperatives for this study through questionnaire administration. The questionnaire containing a five-point Likert scale was posed to respondents to ascertain their problems before and after joining the network (for cooperative) and after joining the cooperative (for members). This study employed the independent two-sample student t-test (two-tailed) to test for significant difference in the means of scores regarding the problems of cooperatives before and after the cooperative network, and also to test for significant difference in the means of scores of the problems of members of the cooperatives before and after joining the cooperative. Findings The study revealed that key production and marketing problems such as increased transaction costs and market uncertainties confronting the cooperative organizations have been diminished as a result of the networks. Key problems of the members of the cooperatives such as exploitation and opportunistic behavior of traders to whom they sell their products have been reduced as a result of joining the cooperatives.

At present, there are 39 milk producers' organisations operating locally, nationwide or even on the central European markets. The paper aims at a better understanding what market conditions and transaction attributes have favoured the emergence and the success of the Czech milk marketing cooperatives as well as if their current objectives and strategies are sufficient for securing their future success. The methodological approach rests largely in the theory of industrial organisation combined with the new institutional economics. Establishing marketing cooperatives, dairy farmers balanced market power with processing industry. It is showed on six case studies that the Czech milk marketing cooperatives follow traditional objectives ( securing sales, fair price and payment discipline); however, their priorities and strategies differ according to their market environment. If the concentration of the dairy industry continues, there will be a need for reconsidering the objectives of milk marketing cooperatives toward a more vertical coordination in the dairy chain.","[Ratinger, Tomas] Technol Ctr ASCR, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic; [Boskova, Iveta] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Ratinger, T (corresponding author), Technol Ctr ASCR, Struhach 27, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic.",ratinger@tc.cz,,"Ratinger, Tomas/0000-0003-1379-2177",,,,,31,9,9,0,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

However, farmers are faced with interrelated constraints in their sunflower production. This study was undertaken to examines the perceptions of the constraints to sunflower production as perceived by smallholder farmers in North West Province, South Africa. The research identifies some factors related to sunflower production constraints. Then, a stratified random sampling technique was used to select 172 sunflower farmers and they were asked to rate their response on these attributes on a 5-points Likert scale. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we agglomerated and condense information from the original datasets of the constraint attributes into three main components (innovation, farm finance, and crop management practice). Because of the hierarchical structure of the dataset with farmers nested within their local municipalities, we use Hierarchical Logistic Modeling techniques to identify the factors that determine farmer's perceived interest in innovation, farm finance, and crop management practices. Innovation and farm finance emerge to be critical elements for sustainable sunflower production. The findings indicate that age, education, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and gender are strongly correlated with farmers' perceived interest in innovation and farm finance characteristics. This study recommends that to promote these elements among smallholder farmers, it is necessary for governments at the local and national level to invest in extension service and education, cooperative organizations, research, and development in disentangling the age, gender, and farm size inequalities existing in the district sunflower production.","[Abafe, Ejovi Akpojevwe; Oduniyi, Oluwaseun Samuel; Tekana, Sibongile Sylvia] Univ South Africa, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, ZA-1709 Roodepoort, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Abafe, EA (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, ZA-1709 Roodepoort, South Africa.",ejoviabafe@gmail.com; eodunios@unisa.ac.za; tekanss@unisa.ac.za,"; oduniyi, oluwaseun samuel/T-8011-2017","Akpojevwe Abafe, Ejovi/0000-0002-2019-4856; oduniyi, oluwaseun samuel/0000-0001-6118-2061",,,,,32,2,2,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,23,,,,,,,13331,10.3390/su132313331,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132313331,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XV0FL,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000734629000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The transfer of public funds to interest organizations is a key dynamic in state-civil society relationships. Research shows that organizations, especially public groups, often heavily rely on public funds to the point that, without funds, many would cease to exist. 'Don't bite the hand that feeds you' is thus a popular expression among leaders of organizations who apply for funds. Scholars document a widespread perception among group leaders that a confrontational attitude towards the state can lead to curtail of public funds. This perception is based on the assumption that state institutions use public funding to discipline confrontational interest organizations. We test this assumption using quantitative and qualitative data collected from a survey of 270 interest organizations who applied for EC funding between 2015 and 2018. Our findings suggest that, while almost half of our survey respondents feel that critical attitudes towards the EU would have negative consequences for their funding applications, empirically, confrontational and cooperative organizations have the same chances of obtaining EC grants. This finding is robust across different interest organization categories, including when non-applicants and mortality anxiety are considered in the analysis. The results add a new layer to resource dependency theory pointing at the incongruence between an organization's perception of its relationship with public institutions and the observation of that relationship.","[Crepaz, Michele] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Hist Anthropol Philosophy & Polit, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Hanegraaff, Marcel] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Queens University Belfast; University of Amsterdam,"Crepaz, M (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Hist Anthropol Philosophy & Polit, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",m.crepaz@qub.ac.uk,,"Hanegraaff, Marcel/0000-0003-0971-1864; Crepaz, Michele/0000-0002-4139-1875",,,,,48,0,0,2,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1755-7739,1755-7747,,EUR POLIT SCI REV,Eur.

It hypothesizes that MOSAL controllers are effective monitors in reducing agency costs. The study employs a multivariate regression model and calculates the t-values using Roger's robust standard errors, correcting for co-op clusters due to the potential cross-sectional correlation and autocorrelation of the error terms to test a sample of 929 observations for 59 consumer cooperative societies from 2000-2018. The empirical results support the hypothesis. Further tests show that low-performing co-ops have lower agency costs. However, the presence of the financial and administrative controllers has no effect on agency costs in high-performing co-ops. Also, the effect that MOSAL controllers have on agency costs varies among co-ops. This study complements a line of research on co-op governance and adds to the empirical evidence on the association of corporate governance and agency costs. It also helps understand how regulators influence management and board discretion to safeguard co-op shareholder rights. Further, it explores an important sector and analyzes a unique, comprehensive, and rarely tested dataset.","[Almutairi, Ali R.] Kuwait Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Accounting, POB 5486, Safat, Kuwait",Kuwait University,"Almutairi, AR (corresponding author), Kuwait Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Accounting, POB 5486, Safat, Kuwait.",Almutairi.ali@ku.edu.kw,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon nine in-depth interviews and naturalistic observations in an urban village of Guangzhou, China, the study empirically investigates how unregulated sidewalk-based hawkers struggle to survive against socioeconomic adversities compared with regulated vendors' operations in a legitimate transitional market. Findings Mirroring a sub-group of rural-to-urban migrants, street vendors espouse subtle strategies centering on purposefulness, resourcefulness and hardiness, which are instantiated through family obligation, sales tactics, merchandising techniques, technology application, trading flexibility, moral sentiment and assistance network. As such, street entrepreneurs are both enacting and constructing resilience in response to specific challenging contexts including impoverishment, operating cost inflation, contingent loss, fierce competition, market uncertainty, intensive workloads, municipal inspection and arbitrary governance practice of village cooperative organization. Research limitations/implications Notwithstanding its limited generalizability, the result sheds light on crystallization of street vendors' resilience and informs social services and policy remedies. Originality/value The study provides a frame of reference to examine the interplay of resilience theory from psychology and entrepreneurship thesis from the field of business management by adding new evidence to the research on entrepreneurial resilience and potentially serves as a catalyst to enrich existing literature with an integrated perspective to comprehend the coping process of these necessity-driven micro-enterprise operators. The antagonistic understanding of informal economy is so predominating that it obscures structural oppression undermining social justice, whereas the spirit of self-reliance among street entrepreneurs is ought to be respected.","[Lin, Shen (Lamson)] Univ Toronto, Factor Inwentash Fac Social Work, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Lin, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Factor Inwentash Fac Social Work, Toronto, ON, Canada.",lamsonlin.lin@mail.utoronto.ca,"Lin, Shen Lamson/B-4611-2018","Lin, Shen Lamson/0000-0002-9792-2372",,,,,67,12,12,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-333X,1758-6720,,INT J SOCIOL SOC POL,Int.

In the integrated rice-duck farming (IRDF) system, ducklings are released into rice paddies in order to maximize the use of renewable resources in a closed-cycle flow of nutrients during rice vegetation periods. Rice-duck farming used to be widely adopted in tropical and subtropical eastern Asian countries, but has remained unpopular in the wake of prevailing agricultural productivism characterized by specialization, intensification, mechanization and excessive dependence on agrochemicals. This paper sets out institutional pathways that can redevelop IRDF in Asia. These include organic food certification systems, organic farmers' cooperatives, community-wide organic farming, localized technical extension and educational services, and between-farm rice-duck integration. A comprehensive package of these institutional tools would further expedite the expansion of IRDF particularly in low-income Southeast Asia where the rice or duck farming landscape is overwhelmingly dominated by smallholders.","Univ Adelaide, Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Suh, J (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jungho.suh@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,51,17,16,0,80,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

It combines the south and South-East Asia with five countries of SAARC and two countries of ASEAN. BIMSTEC is a sector-driven cooperative organisation with key areas of economic cooperation include trade, investment, regional value chains, energy, connectivity, technology, management and capacity building, people to people contact, among others. Even after two decades of existence, BIMSTEC achieved limited progress as India the largest member of the group showed little interest in it. But the failure of SAARC as an effective sub-regional economic integration in Asia and the incorrigible differences between India and Pakistan, the two largest economies of SAARC led to the rethinking and resurrection of BIMSTEC in the recent past. India's strategic interests in the Himalayan, Bay of Bengal and Mekong sub-regions have grown over the years and the expansionist tendencies of China in these regions led to India's renewed engagements with BIMSTEC. In this context, the paper looks into the trade relation between India and BIMSTEC countries and identified the unexplored trade potential and possible areas of cooperation between India and BIMSTEC countries. The trade impact of the likely India BIMSTEC Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) is ascertained using partial equilibrium simulation model. Indicators such as Trade Intensity Index (TII) and Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) showed that there is trade complementary existing between India and BIMSTEC countries and the possibility of enhanced economic cooperation between them. The SMART simulation showed that there is trade creation from a potential India BIMSTEC FTA for the participating countries.

However, historical exploitation of indigenous peoples has resulted in their underachievement worldwide. The popularization of the concept of sustainable development followed a series of international treaties and conventions that shed light on indigenous peoples' revival. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's notion of the power-knowledge relationship, this article uses a case study of an indigenous tribe, the Smangus in Taiwan, to demonstrate how a politically, socially and economically disadvantaged community incorporates their traditional norms and customs into the notion of sustainable development and reinterprets it to adapt the community's conditions. By re-uniting the community and establishing a cooperative organization, the community has revived cohesion in their community.

The socio-economic status of most inhabitants improved significantly as a result of the quinoa boom. However, it also caused severe disturbances in socio-ecological systems and posed challenges to resource governance by traditional indigenous institutions. This article focuses on the role of farmer cooperatives, in particular, and examines how their production rules may have mitigated some of the challenges associated with the quinoa boom. We assess the activities of cooperatives with the help of Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and analytic tools such as the ADICO grammar (Attribute, Deontic, aim, Condition, Or else) and the eight design principles. The key production rules of cooperatives are examined and compliance with these rules is estimated based on semi-structured interviews and a survey conducted with quinoa producers (n=305). We argue that the cooperatives successfully contributed to alleviate pressures on resources in a context where traditional authorities were challenged by new tasks associated with land grabbing and the crowding out of diversified agricultural activities. In conclusion, we argue that collaboration between traditional authorities and farmer cooperatives holds great potential for improving the governance and sustainability of socio-ecological systems in the region.","[Tschopp, Maurice; Bieri, Sabin; Rist, Stephan] Univ Bern, Inst Geog GIUB, CDE, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Tschopp, M (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog GIUB, CDE, Bern, Switzerland.",maurice.tschopp@cde.unibe.ch; sabin.bieii@cde.unibe.ch; stephan.rist@cde.unibe.ch,,"Bieri, Sabin/0000-0001-5919-2455",Swiss national Foundation,Swiss national Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This research was founded by the Swiss national Foundation.,,65,14,14,3,15,"IGITUR, UTRECHT PUBLISHING & ARCHIVING SERVICES",URTRECHT,"POSTBUS 80124, URTRECHT, 3508 TC, NETHERLANDS",1875-0281,,,INT J COMMONS,Int.

Such problems are believed to be hindering the adoption of sustainable forest management (SFM) and forest certification by forest farmers in China. Two strategies were introduced by the Chinese government with the purpose of addressing these issues, namely forest tenure reforms and their associated supporting mechanism, forestry property markets. Through two case studies in southern China, we investigated the effectiveness of the two strategies as well as their implications for the adoption of SFM and forest certification. The two cases were Yong'an in Fujian province and Tonggu in Jiangxi province. Personal interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with small-scale forest farmers who had already benefited from the two strategies as well as market officers working for the two selected forestry property markets. The study identified eight issues constraining the potential adoption of SFM and certification in China, including limited finance, poorly developed infrastructure and transport systems, insecure forest tenures, inconsistent forest policies, low levels of awareness, illegal forest management practices, lack of local cooperative organizations, and inadequate knowledge and technical transfer. We found that the new forest tenure reforms and forestry property markets had generally fulfilled their original objectives and had the capacity to assist in addressing many of the issues facing forests prior to the reforms.

This is a serious omission for two main reasons: first, because county governments perform a key role in providing support for farmers through agricultural extension services and farmers' cooperatives, and second, because county-level administrative divisions are central to developing novel instruments to manage supply chain relationships, such as food production standards. We investigate the key players involved in standard making and delivery at the county level. We also analyse how and why the county government engages in standard-setting activities. We use Lin'an's bamboo shoot production industry as a case study to understand how the local state implements hazard-free, green and forest food production standards. The paper concludes that traditional conceptualizations of the local state do not sufficiently address how nature, knowledge of standards and state authority co-produce institutional capacity to control food supply and quality in China. In practice, the local state engages with non-state actors to achieve superficial environmental efforts, such as developing food production standards to throw a green cloak over a productivist model.","[Chan, Kin Wing (Ray)] Univ Exeter, Sch Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Flynn, Andrew] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of Exeter; Cardiff University,"Chan, KW (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Geog, Exeter, Devon, England.",k.chan2@exeter.ac.uk; FlynnAC@cardiff.ac.uk,"Chan, Kin Wing/P-3166-2019","Chan, Kin Wing (Ray)/0000-0001-7729-6098; Flynn, Andrew/0000-0001-5728-1569",Cardiff University President's Research Scholarship Fund between 2011 and 2014,Cardiff University President's Research Scholarship Fund between 2011 and 2014,"This project was generously funded by the Cardiff University President's Research Scholarship Fund between 2011 and 2014.

Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucatan, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16 months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron-client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron-client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron-client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world's SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-avis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine the impact of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management, we built binary logistic models and Tobit models by applying a sample survey data of 500 households in rural Jiangxi in 2018. Households' participation and investment in forest management were measured by their labor and cash input. The results indicated that more off-farm laborers in household would hold back their participation in cash input. In contrast, a higher rate of female off-farm employment encouraged household monetary input. And households with more female agricultural laborers were more likely to participate in labor input. Neither off-farm employment nor female off-farm employment significantly influences households' labor input. Off-farm employment of the householder negatively influenced labor and cash input. Policy factors, such as obtaining forestry subsidies and forestry loans, joining forestry co-operative organizations, and better attitude to the logging quota system, also promoted households' participation and investment in forest management. Household head's age and education, forestry land status also affected participation in forest management. Our analysis could provide basis for managers to formulate policies to support sustainable forest management. Recommendations for Resource Managers: The econometric models applied in this research could reflect the influence of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management behavior and provide a quantitative basis for formulating forest management policies. There were great differences between rural households' forest management cash input behavior and labor input behavior and households were more active in labor input compared with cash input. The gender structure of rural labor off-farm employment could impact households' forest management participation and investment. To achieve sustainable forest management, managers should pay attention to enhancing female forestry technique training and encouraging forest land transfer and consolidation in the collective forest regions of China.","[Xie, Fangting; Kang, Xiaolan; Zhu, Shubin] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Changbei Econ & Technol Dev Zone, Ctr Sannong Study, 11011101 Zhimin Ave, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Xie, Fangting; Zhu, Shubin] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Changbei Econ & Technol Dev Zone, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Agr & Decis Support, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Du, Juan; Liu, Xiaojin] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Changbei Econ & Technol Dev Zone, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Agricultural University; Jiangxi Agricultural University; Jiangxi Agricultural University,"Zhu, SB (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Changbei Econ & Technol Dev Zone, Ctr Sannong Study, 11011101 Zhimin Ave, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",shubinzhu@163.com,,"Xie, Fangting/0000-0001-8570-5402","Major Program of China's State Forestry and Grassland Administration [JYC2019-76]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701622, 71840013]; Science and Technology Research Program of Jiangxi Provincial Education Department [GJJ160392]; Collaborative Innovation Center Program in Jiangxi province [XDNYD02]",Major Program of China's State Forestry and Grassland Administration; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Research Program of Jiangxi Provincial Education Department; Collaborative Innovation Center Program in Jiangxi province,"Major Program of China's State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Grant/Award Number: JYC2019-76; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41701622, 71840013; Science and Technology Research Program of Jiangxi Provincial Education Department, Grant/Award Number: GJJ160392; Collaborative Innovation Center Program in Jiangxi province, Grant/Award Number: XDNYD02",,49,10,10,3,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0890-8575,1939-7445,,NAT RESOUR MODEL,Nat.

Analyzing the modes of governance used by the Polish agricultural producer groups,AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA,,,English,Article,,,,,,co-operatives; governance; organizational choice; Poland; socialist legacy,FARMERS COOPERATIVES; ISSUES,"The cooperative movement in Poland has a long but difficult history, which has caused farmers to have an aversion to cooperatives. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s, the first farmers' cooperative marketing organizations, which were called agricultural producer groups, appeared in the market. These groups are bottom-up, voluntary organizations the primary purpose of which is to jointly sell their members' output. In this paper, it is investigated why the new forms of governance, namely cooperative arrangements, were chosen, and we evaluate the implications of these choices on the market success of these groups. Empirical data were collected from 62 producer groups in one Polish province. We found that the groups were typically functioning as associations, unions, and limited liability companies. The factors that had an impact on the choices made were the number of members and the specific investment per member. Additionally, if the initial investment level was low, not only set-up and operational costs but also tax considerations played a role in the decision. Therefore, we argue that the new bottom-up cooperatives, which are theoretically suitable when the start-up capital is high or the number of members is large, will gradually be recognized and accepted in the market despite the fact that these cooperatives have a bad reputation caused by the socialist legacy. The new cooperative development trend confirms this argument.","[Beckmann, Volker] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Greifswald, Germany; [Otto, Ilona M.; Tan, Rong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Otto, Ilona M.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald; Zhejiang University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Tan, R (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Yuhangtang Rd 886, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",tanrong@zju.edu.cn,"Beckmann, Volker/Q-7377-2018; Otto, Ilona Magdalena/GNP-4425-2022","Beckmann, Volker/0000-0001-6595-7995;","National Science Foundation of China [71273008, 71350110520]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71273008; 71350110520).,,24,8,8,1,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A MC receives less favourable terms on outside equity than a conventional firm because the decision power regarding new investments is not allocated to the providers of these funds. This is a serious threat to the survival of a MC in a market where efficient investments are characterised by an increasing level of asset specificity at the processing stage of production. A MC is predicted to be an efficient organisational form when the level of asset specificity at the processing stage of production is at a low or immediate level compared to the level of asset specificity at the farming stage of production.

In the first part of the paper, the government can choose to support the formation of a marketing cooperative by a group of farmers, or to establish a public marketing firm. The resulting market structures will thus be a duopoly of one marketing cooperative and one private wholesaler, or a mixed duopoly including a public firm. The equilibrium outcomes of the two market arrangements are analysed and the welfare implications compared. It is shown that both consumers' surplus and total welfare are higher in a mixed duopoly with public firm than in a mixed duopoly with cooperative, which is in turn socially superior to a pure private duopoly.

To meet the proposed objective, this article uses a qualitative approach and descriptive character. As of Law No. 11.947 of 2009, the PNAE became one of the main access markets for family farmers and their collective organizations (cooperatives, associations or informal groups). In this context, collective organizations have become essential tools that work in different areas: in carrying out social and political articulations, in negotiating prices and delivery terms, in participating in the construction of Public Tenders and in intermediating the commercialization process, by fact of carrying out the purchase and sale operations, representing a group of producers in the PNAE. However, organizations face challenges of different natures, both to access and to expand access to the program, especially organizational, institutional and relational challenges. It was concluded that, due to the importance of cooperatives and associations in public policy implementation networks, it is necessary for the Brazilian State to support such tools, through articulations between the various actors involved and through planning and monitoring processes for the execution of the PNAE and of strengthening cooperativism and associativism.","[Jorge Moreira, Isabela Reno; de Freitas, Alair Ferreira; de Freitas, Alan Ferreira; Cota Miranda, Renato Cesar; Alves Junior, Almiro] Univ Fed Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"Moreira, IRJ (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",isabela.moreira@ufv.br; alair.freitas@ufv.br; alanf.freitas@ufv.br; almiroalves@gmail.com,"Lopes, Mariana f/IAR-3054-2023",,,,,,38,0,1,0,6,"UNIV ZULIA, CONSEJO DESARROLLO CIENTIFICO & HUMANISTICO",MARACAIBO,"AV UNIV CALLE 60 25-266, SECTOR GRANO DE ORO, MARACAIBO, 00000, VENEZUELA",1315-0006,,,ESPACIO ABIERTO,Espacio Abierto,SEP,2021,30,3,,,,,196,227,,,,,,32,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,WD1FJ,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000704695000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The two key assumptions are constraints on lump-sum transfers from poorer members and disproportionate control rights wielded by wealthier members. Transfers of rents to the latter are achieved by depressing prices paid for inputs supplied by members and diverting resulting retained earnings. The theory predicts that increased heterogeneity of landholdings in the local area causes increased inefficiency by inducing a lower input price and a lower level of installed crushing capacity. Predictions concerning the effect of the distribution of local landownership on sugarcane price, capacity levels, and participation rates of different classes of farmers are confirmed by data from nearly 100 sugar cooperatives in the Indian state of Maharashtra over the period 1971-93.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; NYU, New York, NY USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Boston University; University of Pennsylvania; New York University,"Banerjee, A (corresponding author), MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,41,79,80,1,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,,,J POLIT ECON,J.

In conclusion, the de lege ferenda postulates regarding credit unions' regulation in Poland are presented. Credit unions in Poland conduct not for profit business activity only with their members with reservation to mediating in specific contracts on financial market which can be also conducted with nonmembers. Credit unions activity is subject to supervision of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (FSA). Therefore credit unions regulation is characterized by duality of legal regime of private and administrative law. However, in certain fields of credit unions activity the FSA's supervision, performed under administrative legal regime, raises justified doubts in the light of the principle of cooperative autonomy as the FSA by law has the authority to impose specific orders and prohibitions on credit unions.","[Bierecki, Dominik] Natl Assoc Cooperat Savings & Credit Unions, Cooperat Res Inst, Sopot, Poland",,"Bierecki, D (corresponding author), Natl Assoc Cooperat Savings & Credit Unions, Cooperat Res Inst, Sopot, Poland.",d.bierecki@krpj.pl,"Bierecki, Dominik/AAM-9525-2021","Bierecki, Dominik/0000-0001-6993-3974",,,,,47,6,6,1,5,"UNIV DEUSTO, FAC DERECHO",BILBAO,"AVENIDA DE LAS UNIVERSIDADES 24, BILBAO, VIZCAYA 48007, SPAIN",1134-993X,2386-4893,,BOL ASOC INT DERECHO,Bol.

Design/methodology/approach Data used in this study were primary data collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires with 1-5 Likert scale. The sample consisted of the representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in Central Java Province, representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in West Java Province and some farmers who are members of those dairy cooperatives. This study uses balanced supply chain management scorecard for measuring the performance of dairy supply chain, importance-performance analysis (IPA) for identifying the indicators that are most in need of improvement, and strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) analysis for formulating strategic planning. Findings The results of balanced supply chain management scorecard combined with IPA analysis showed that the performance relationship between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in West Java Province is slightly better than that in Central Java Province. It can be seen from the average value of the score of indicator, the category of each indicator and the category of the performance index of each relationship. The major weakness of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province lies in the different perspective (no perspective is dominant), whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer. On the other hand, the major strength of the relationship in Central Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer, whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of learning and growth. Research limitations/implications The limitation of this study is related to the number of the dairy cooperatives as the sample and the type of scale used to measure the performance of the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and individual milk processors. So, the future research may replicate this study by surveying all the dairy cooperatives in Central Java and West Java Provinces. It may also enhance the measurement of the performance of the relationships by using a direct measure of each indicator in each perspective, rather than recording the management of dairy cooperative perceptions. Practical implications This research provides essential insights for the management of dairy cooperative in the context of strategic planning development. The research reveals that there is a different strategic planning for improving the performance of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in each province. It depends on the major weakness and strength of the relationships, and also, opportunity and threat faced by the dairy industry. One important thing, the management of dairy cooperative in both provinces should have strategic planning related to the use of machine milking by farmers to improve the milk quality. Social implications The research revealed that strategic planning could be built after analyzing the internal and external conditions carefully. It may encourage more dairy cooperatives to measure and analyze the internal and external conditions at the bottom of strategic planning of their business. Originality/value Although this research only used the balanced supply chain management scorecard and IPA analysis for measuring the performance, and SWOT analysis in formulating the strategic planning for improving the current performance, it will make a difference. First, instead of measuring the performance of dairy cooperatives, this research measured the performance of the relationships between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors. This way, the dairy cooperatives were only sources of data collection. Second, the investigation was quite complicated since the objects of the research were represented by the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province and West Java Province.","[Susanty, Aries; Bakhtiar, Arfan; Puspitasari, Nia Budi; Mustika, Della] Univ Diponegoro, Dept Ind Engn, Semarang, Indonesia",Diponegoro University,"Susanty, A (corresponding author), Univ Diponegoro, Dept Ind Engn, Semarang, Indonesia.",ariessusanty@gmail.com; arfanbakhtiar@googlemail.com; niabudipuspitasari@gmail.com; dellamustikaputri20@gmail.com,"Puspitasari, Nia Budi/GQR-1091-2022; susanty, aries/Q-2267-2015","Puspitasari, Nia Budi/0000-0003-3141-8138; susanty, aries/0000-0003-0601-5206; Bakhtiar, Arfan/0000-0002-8763-377X",,,,,53,5,5,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0401,1758-6658,,INT J PRODUCT PERFOR,Int.

It focuses on how, over the years, nested governance structures facilitated iterative learning, which helped build resilience against unexpected external crises. Drawing on adaptive management and resilience studies, this study examines the historical development of the local fishery cooperative association (FCA) as a series of responses to socio-ecological disasters - responses that this article characterizes as iterative learning. During the recovery after the 2011 tsunami, the FCA functioned as an information hub that directed the flow of knowledge and resources through government and industrial hierarchies, to the benefit of the farmers. This research, conducted between 2015 and 2017, is based on interviews with farmers, cooperative administrators, and government officials, as well as an analysis of archived records, fishery regulations and post-disaster subsidy programs.","[Ito, Takeshi; Watanabe, Takehiro] Sophia Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Tokyo, Japan",Sophia University,"Ito, T (corresponding author), Sophia Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioicho, Tokyo 1028554, Japan.",takeshi.ito@sophia.ac.jp,"Ito, Takeshi/AAI-6346-2021; Watanabe, Takehiro/HTN-3630-2023","Ito, Takeshi/0000-0002-0446-6487;",JSPS; Sumitomo Foundation; Akkeshi Waterfowl Observation Center,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Sumitomo Foundation; Akkeshi Waterfowl Observation Center","Fieldwork in Akkeshi was made possible by generous grants from the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research Sophia University, the Sumitomo Foundation, and the Akkeshi Waterfowl Observation Center.",,53,3,3,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

This was done by adapting and testing a measurement scale based on the one-dimensional model proposed by Porter. Design/methodology/approach Field work was carried out, with a structured questionnaire being given to a significant sample of workers in Ecuadorian cooperatives (2,499 employees and heads of department). The scale was adapted through a structural equation model. Findings The results show that the adaptation of the measuring scale for affective organizational commitment using a one-dimensional vision is consistent for the cooperative sector. In addition, the analysis of the socio-demographic variables and the work position show that some of them have a statistically significant relationship with organizational commitment. Practical implications - The proposed scale can contribute to the management of human capital in cooperatives in Ecuador. It can also be used as a tool to support the national agency in charge of the cooperative sector in this country (Superintendencia de Economia Popular y Solidaria, Superintendency of Popular and Solidarity Economy). By applying this tool, social economy organizations in Ecuador can measure the level of their employees' affective commitment with the institution they work in. Using the results, the people in charge and the leaders of the organization shall be able to introduce strategies to develop this organizational variable that is crucial for the proper management of human resources and, therefore, to help to obtain the institutional purposes. Originality/value This research project presents a measuring tool that can discover the unique features of the cooperative sector in a developing country such as Ecuador as it provides a special framework for managing human resources in this sector. Additionally, in a cooperative organization many employees have different roles in the same company. This tool can be adapted for other kinds of cooperatives with different activities (financial and non-financial activities) in different sectors.","[Hidalgo-Fernandez, Amalia; Santa Cruz, Francisco Gonzalez] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain; [Mero, Nelly Moreira] Univ Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Manta, Ecuador; [Alcivar, Maria Iliana Loor] Univ Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi, Manta, Ecuador",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro De Manabi; Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro De Manabi,"Mero, NM (corresponding author), Univ Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Manta, Ecuador.",ahidalgo@uco.es; nmoreiramero@hotmail.com; mili8_loal@hotmail.com; td1gosaf@uco.es,"Santa Cruz, Francisco González/AAE-2480-2020; Hidalgo-Fernández, Amalia/AFO-3158-2022","Santa Cruz, Francisco González/0000-0002-3872-7366; Hidalgo Fernandez, Maria Amalia/0000-0002-2764-6624; LOOR ALCIVAR, MARIA ILIANA/0000-0002-1396-5501",,,,,65,5,5,2,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0262-1711,1758-7492,,J MANAG DEV,J.

Furthermore, the contracts of cooperation between the members in OASC are discussed. Based on both theory differential game and bi-level programming, we utilize the Nerlove-Arrow model and Stackelberg model to examine five cases of decision modes for both agents in the OASC. Then, we achieve the optimal strategies where the specified sets of organic growing effort, organic traceability technology effort, propaganda input, and service input can guarantee the maximization of the related profits. As a result, we could obtain the values of the corresponding optimal profits. For the centralized decision mode, the farmer cooperative and the online retailer make decisions with the goal of maximizing the overall profits of the OASC. Meanwhile, for the decentralized decision mode with four different cases, each member will independently make a decision with the goal of maximizing his own profit respectively. In detail, as for the fully decentralized decision mode, no contracts exist in OASC; regarding the decentralized decision mode with an information traceability cost sharing contract, two members pay the information traceability cost together; and for the decentralized decision mode with a revenue sharing contract, two members share the revenue together; as to the decentralized decision mode with a comprehensive contract, there are two cooperative ways that information traceability cost sharing and revenue sharing can be achieved. In addition, we also considered factors such as the consumer preferences of organic products and the cross influence between channels in models. Finally, through sensitivity analysis and comparison of optimal strategies and profits, we found that: (1) high consumer preferences of organic products and high cross influence between channels are profitable; and (2) the choice of contract is influenced by the relative size of the offline marginal income ratio and the online marginal income ratio.","[Hu, Qifan; Xu, Bing] Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qifan] Nanchang Inst Technol, Sch Business Adm, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Nanchang University; Nanchang Institute Technology,"Xu, B (corresponding author), Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",setsail@nit.edu.cn; xubing99@ncu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71561018]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China [20171BAA218002]; Major Projects of the Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education [17JJD790012]; University Humanities and Social Science Project of Jiangxi Province of China [GL162041]; Graduate Innovation Program of Nanchang University [CX2017244],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); Major Projects of the Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education; University Humanities and Social Science Project of Jiangxi Province of China; Graduate Innovation Program of Nanchang University,"This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71561018), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China (Grant No. 20171BAA218002), Major Projects of the Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education (Grant No. 17JJD790012), University Humanities and Social Science Project of Jiangxi Province of China (Grant No. GL162041), Graduate Innovation Program of Nanchang University (Grant No. CX2017244).",,53,12,14,5,84,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,,,,,848,10.3390/su11030848,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11030848,,,34,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL7NY,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000458929500293,View Full Record in Web of Science

This debate underscores that social justice in global agriculture is fundamentally multiplein Nancy Fraser's terms, abnormal.

The concentration of power in the bureaucracy, the absence of accountability, the lack of an effective judicial mechanism, and existence of too many agencies with overlapping policy mandates are the direct reasons for the failure of management transfer over irrigation infrastructure (MTI) in China; accountability is problematic in irrigation systems with officials' primary accountability upward to their supervisors and to the political level. To enhance the level of farmers' participation, it is important to accelerate farmers' cooperative behavior by fostering the social circumstance of cooperation, providing technical support and establishing land transferring mechanism. Factors underlying the arrangement of governance structure are uncertain of future benefits, relative effectiveness of maintenance effort, and risk attitudes of different parties. The fundamental issue is the absence of manager's accountability to farmer users.","Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,,,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,3,UNIV ELECTRONIC SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY CHINA PRESS,CHENGDU,"UESTC PRESS, CHENGDU, 610054, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2007,,,,,,,361,368,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BGY05,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000251230100055,View Full Record in Web of Science

Special attention is paid to community-based organic agriculture as a pathway to rural development. The Philippines has two decades of experience of community-based natural resource management. Unlike public natural resources such as forests, watersheds or fisheries, however, the community-based organic agriculture programme is intended to deal with the private property regime. Thus, if the programme is to be successful, agrarian land reform must continue. Integrated rice-duck farming is among the suitable and viable options for organic agriculture, given that rice is a major agricultural crop and duck meat is popular in the Philippines. Area-based organic food certification systems need to be formulated and a government-farmers partnership should be forged to facilitate farmers' access to domestic and international organic food markets.","[Suh, Jungho] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Suh, J (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jungho.suh@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,31,8,8,1,33,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",0030-7270,2043-6866,,OUTLOOK AGR,Outlook Agric.,DEC,2015,44,4,,,,,291,296,,10.5367/oa.2015.0222,http://dx.doi.org/10.5367/oa.2015.0222,,,6,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DB3NS,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000368419000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

A case study of the COATO farming cooperative showed us that its environmental management, focused on prevention logic, has had a positive net effect on its environmental performance. Besides, the order in which these practices were adopted favoured the development of new organisational capabilities that have contributed to the appearance of advantages derived from the greater accumulated experience of employees in creating new projects that are designed to reduce residues and pollution. COATO has also obtained a competitive advantage in differentiation thanks to an improved brand image and to its increased credibility in business relationships. Finally, a positive correlation exists between the pioneering proactive strategy adopted by this cooperative and the improvement of its firm performance with respect to the other firms in its sector.

The paper discusses a multi-actor farmland consolidation model that avoids some of the drawbacks identified by literature to some models of land mobilization, mostly transaction and agency costs. This model consists on a local-based strategy of common land management, led by a cooperative and supported by a set of external agents. As empirical evidences, we show the attitudes of cooperatives' managers surveyed towards common land management and present a case study implementing this multi-actor model.

Community members express the desire to exert greater local control over food production, distribution, and consumption through community gardens, farmers markets, and cooking and food preservation classes.

In tests for differences in risk of bankruptcy and of breaching regulatory standards, risk is found to be greater for credit unions with broader field-of-membership types. These differences in risk appear to derive from greater earnings volatility and lower ROA and net-worth ratios at community and multiple-bond credit unions.

Our study corroborated the conditions of economic poverty among small-scale coffee farmer households in Central America and Mexico. All certifications provided a higher price per pound and higher gross coffee revenue than non-certified coffee. However, the average volumes of coffee sold by individual households were low, and many certified farmers did not sell their entire production at certified prices. Certifications did not have a discernable effect on other livelihood-related variables, such as education, and incidence of migration at the household level, although they had a positive influence on savings and credit. Sales to certified markets offer farmers and cooperatives better prices, but the contribution derived from these premiums has limited effects on household livelihoods. This demonstrates that certifications will not single-handedly bring significant poverty alleviation to most coffee-farming families. Although certified coffee markets alone will not resolve the livelihood challenges faced by smallholder households, they could still contribute to broad-based sustainable livelihoods, rural development and conservation processes in coffee regions. This can be done by developing more active partnerships between farmers, cooperatives, certifications and environmental and rural development organizations and researchers in coffee regions. Certifications, especially Fair Trade/organic, have proven effective in supporting capacity building and in serving as networks that leverage global development funding for small-scale coffee-producing households.","[Mendez, V.

Unlike these studies, the present paper deals with a marketing cooperative of micro or small enterprises in fishing industry, formed to negotiate a contracted price with large buyers, sharing risk among members of the cooperative. In the paper a game-theoretical model for the behaviour in this cooperative is set up. By the time of the actual commercialization of the product, the market price may be higher than what the cooperative can guarantee for members, negotiated on beforehand. Therefore some unfaithful members may be interested in selling at least a part of their product on the free market, the cooperative, however, can punish them for this. This conflict is modelled with a multi-person normal form game. An evolutionary dynamics is proposed for the continuous change of the applied strategies, which in the long term leads to a particular Nash equilibrium, considered the solution of the game. This strategy dynamics is continuously influenced by an exosystem describing the dynamics of fishing, based on a classical fishing effort model. This approach focuses only on the conflict within the marketing cooperative, since it is supposed that the single enterprises fish from independent resources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The historical analysis, which was based on the political settlements framework, has shown that the policies implemented in the cocoa sector went through four periods. The colonial era was characterised by a fairly corporate governance system and struggle between European traders and farmer cooperatives for monopoly over internal marketing of cocoa. This was followed by the early post-independence era (1957-1980), which was characterised by neopatrimonialism and over-taxation of cocoa farmers. The third phase (1980-2000) witnessed economic reforms and liberalisation. The fourth phase (2000 to present) saw increased public-private partnerships aimed at empowering women and promoting environmentally friendly farming activities. The paper concludes that the policies in the cocoa sector have, historically, created more benefits (rents) to political elite and their crony capitalists. Given that rent-seeking behaviour is a threat to the sustainability of the cocoa sector, the paper urges international development partners and civil society groups to demand greater accountability and transparency from the political elite and state institutions in the cocoa sector.","[Teye, Joseph Kofi; Nikoi, Ebenezer] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, POB LG 59, Legon, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Teye, JK (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, POB LG 59, Legon, Ghana.",teyejoseph@yahoo.co.uk,,"Teye, Joseph/0000-0001-6493-3238; Nikoi, Ebenezer Goodman Ashie/0009-0009-9947-5842",UK aid of the UK government,UK aid of the UK government,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The research was conducted with funding from UK aid of the UK government.",,52,0,0,5,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0021-9096,1745-2538,,J ASIAN AFR STUD,J.

These institutions are referred to collectively as the cooperative movement, even though, paradoxically, they usually are extensions of government programs and subject to supervision by government officials. This paper examines the local-level effects of that paradox by briefly reviewing the history of the Sri Lank-an state's use of cooperatives since independence in 1948 and by looking at the rise and fall of one particular pottery production and marketing cooperative over that same 50-year period. In the process, we see that the effects of state economic policies are not determinative but, rather, inherently uncertain because: 1) the ideological apparatus of which the policies are a part shifts over time; and 2) center policies interact in unpredictable ways with local agents, discourses, and agendas.

We analyze the importance of the Basel III additional capital buffer requirements for credit union prudential regulation. Based on a sample of the 100 largest credit unions in Canada from 1996 to 2014, we find that Canadian credit union capital buffers behave countercyclically over the business cycle. Further, credit unions hold a capital buffer bigger than the maximum buffer advocated under Basel III which is 5% of risk-weighted assets (RWA). These results suggest that, unlike commercial banks worldwide, credit unions, by and large, are already in compliance with the new Basel III buffer requirements. However, there is evidence that the capital buffers of low-capitalized credit unions are procyclical. These credit unions increased their RWA during booms but failed to build up additional capital accordingly. Hence, weakly capitalized credit unions are more likely to adjust their capital buffers if they are subject to Basel III capital buffer regulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We document significant differences in subprime lending between banks and credit unions prior to and during the Great Recession. In 2006, 23.6% of mortgages from commercial banks were subprime versus only 3.6% of mortgages from credit unions. Moreover, banks were more likely to fail, and had higher delinquency and net charge-off ratios immediately following the financial crisis. Our empirical models control for important differences between credit unions and banks including firm-level characteristics, borrower-level characteristics, and state-level economic conditions. We argue that the remaining difference captures the effects of credit unions' nonprofit and cooperative structure, which encourages them to internalize the utility of their customer-owners. Our findings explain why credit unions often appear more risk averse relative to commercial banks, a result with important research and policy implications.

While making a contribution to the research on the longevity of cooperatives, we tried to identify some regularities concerning the survival of these entities in the specific context of transition economies. In this paper, we look more closely at potential relationships between the development of producers' organizations (POs) and the size of their membership. Then, we link the size of the membership with the concept of social capital. For our purposes, it is necessary to depart from using a general concept of social capital and to differentiate between bonding and bridging social capital. Our results, based on two unique datasets from Poland, clearly showed that relatively larger POs have higher rates of survival. This, in turn, is correlated with the stock and the type of social capital. The main contribution of the study is in identifying the relevance of the size of the membership of newly-established POs to their survival. The findings are followed by policy recommendations that may be useful in the context of promoting farmers' cooperation in recognizing the low stock of social capital, specifically bridging social capital.","[Chlebicka, Aleksandra; Pietrzak, Michal] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ Sci, PL-02782 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Pietrzak, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ Sci, PL-02782 Warsaw, Poland.",aleksandra_chlebicka@sggw.pl; michal_pietrzak@sggw.pl,"Chlebicka, Aleksandra/B-6104-2014","Chlebicka, Aleksandra/0000-0002-3896-154X; Pietrzak, Michal/0000-0002-0418-3436",,,,,84,14,14,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2018,10,7,,,,,,,2293,10.3390/su10072293,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10072293,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP5WQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000440947600184,View Full Record in Web of Science

Impacts of those changes included variable well levels, increased infrastructure costs, and ecosystem impacts, which farmers had responded to by implementing multiple management strategies.

A requirement for increased efficiency, though, is that the farmers' benefits are larger than the Fairtrade processing costs and the excess payment by consumers that does not accrue to farmers; otherwise direct transfers to farmers would be more efficient. This paper analyzes how excess payment for Fairtrade-labeled coffee is distributed in the Swedish market, using information on production costs and scanner data on almost all roasted and ground coffee products sold by retailers. A key finding is that roasters and retailers get 61-70%, while producer countries, in this paper comprising coffee farmers, cooperatives, middlemen, exporters, and Fairtrade International, get 24-31%; Fairtrade Sweden gets 6-8%. These values are the upper and lower bounds that reflect assumptions made about the additional costs of producing roasted and ground Fairtrade coffee, given the cost of beans and the Fairtrade license. The Fairtrade label thus seems to create a coffee product that roasters and retailers can use to exploit their market power.","[Durevall, Dick] HUI Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Durevall, Dick] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Durevall, D (corresponding author), HUI Res, Stockholm, Sweden.;Durevall, D (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",dick.durevall@gu.se,,,Swedish Competition Authority,Swedish Competition Authority,Financial support from the Swedish Competition Authority is gratefully acknowledged.,,58,3,3,6,50,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7099,,ECONOMIES,Economies,JUN,2020,8,2,,,,,,,30,10.3390/economies8020030,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/economies8020030,,,17,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,MO0IW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000551222000021,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study draws on environmental communication theory, the theory of the coordinated management of meaning, and Vandana Shiva's three-tiered economic model to construct a communication-based framework through which to view farmers' stories about sustainability. This framework is productive, showing how some Nuevo Mexicano farmers (and others) orient toward farming, sustenance, and human-nature relationships through community, family, heritage, and education. Moreover, in addition to a conceptualization of sustainability as specific practices for nurturing and enduring in environments, communities, and organizations/institutions, sustainability can be understood as embedded ecocultural and historical experience with cross-cultural parallels in land-based communities. This study advances the ethical duty of environmental communication to better understand the ways in which environmental discourse and ecocultural and material realities are imbricated, as well as the call for such discursive study to be grounded in phenomenological experience of the natural world.","[Hoffmann, Jeffrey Alan] Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Hoffmann, JA (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",jhoffmann@unm.edu,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

But the pricing system (CIF or FOB) and the extent of local competition define the level and spatial rate of change in prices. Estimations of an empirical price-location function for Iowa during the spring of 2003 suggest that prices near the plants of four conventional businesses conform to the CIF pricing model.

This article examines the role of primary co-operative societies (PCSs) in co-ordinating the tobacco contract farming system. The article traces the transition from public marketing boards to private sector predominance and contributes to an understanding of the dynamics of contractual arrangements between private capital and smallholder tobacco farmers. It draws primarily on data collected through in-depth interviews with tobacco-processing companies and the leaders of PCSs in Urambo district, Tanzania. The analysis shows that the PCSs that are central to this sector need to ensure that their members farm in accordance with good agricultural practices and comply with reforestation and labour practice requirements as part of the industry's focus on corporate social responsibility programmes and the promulgation of strategies addressing social and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the PCSs have become the gatekeepers for local development projects co-funded by the Tanzanian tobacco processing companies and global cigarette brand owners. The article argues that the PCSs' ability to capture economic benefits for local development by tapping into the tobacco value chain depends not only on PCS leadership qualifications, capabilities and their capacity to 'align' farmers with the required cultivation practices, but also on the bargaining capacity of the PCSs in relation to the tobacco processing companies, which is influenced by whether the supply base is reliable in both quantity and quality. Recent developments in the contract farming arrangements provide new constellations of economic dynamics and opportunities for social and economic development activities at the PCS and village levels. The article ends with a discussion of rural development outcomes based on tobacco revenues, showing how contract farming integrates local communities into the dynamics of the global tobacco value chain while simultaneously reproducing local socio-economic differentiation.","[Makoye, Edward Bahati; Kuzilwa, Joseph Andrew] Mzumbe Univ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Larsen, Marianne Nylandsted] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Makoye, EB (corresponding author), Mzumbe Univ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",emakoye@mzumbe.ac.tz; mnl@ign.ku.dk; jakuzilwa@mzumbe.ac.tz,"Larsen, Marianne Nylandsted/E-7655-2015","Larsen, Marianne Nylandsted/0000-0003-4423-4784",Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) [13-P03-TAN],Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA),"We acknowledge the support of the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) via grant number 13-P03-TAN, which provided full financial support for data collection through the Potentials and Limitations of Contract Farming (POLICOFA) research project.

Thus, this paper uses Brazil's experience with biodiesel as a basis for proposing a framework for a Biodiesel Program in Guinea-Bissau. The proposed framework includes the following elements related to public policy, regulations, organizations and mechanisms: (i) introduction of biodiesel through the creation and implementation of laws and regulations; (ii) an Inter-ministerial Executive Committee to plan, coordinate and manage the program; (iii) promotion, incentives and support for agricultural and agro-industrial production by providing tax benefits for specific links of the chain, creating incentive programs for different oilseeds and establishing programs that support family farming; and (iv) the creation and installation of representative bodies for the stakeholders involved in the chain, such as small farmers cooperatives, national association of biodiesel producers, R&D and rural extension programs.","[Dos Santos, Manoela Silveira] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana UNIOESTE, Business Management Dept, Toledo, Brazil; [Ianda, Tito Francisco; Padula, Antonio Domingos] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Escola Adm, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Dos Santos, MS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Oeste Parana UNIOESTE, Business Management Dept, Rua Padre Lino Beal 1135, Toledo, Brazil.",manoelasantospoa@gmail.com,"Padula, Antonio D/B-2992-2019; Ianda, Tito/ABB-7677-2020","Ianda, Tito/0000-0002-0846-7217",,,,,28,3,3,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

In contrast with abundant studies that explore the governmentality of migrant workers in urban China, rare scholar attention is dedicated to the group of migrant farmers who only move within rural China. Drawing on a detailed analysis of governance dynamics of Lianhua village, Hunan province, this study finds that migrant famers could undermine village governance in the place of destination from three dimensions: by disturbing social orders; overpricing or exploiting farmland; and paralyzing operation of village affairs. The critical factor deciding whether migrant farmers commit such acts is the degree of their spontaneous solidarity. This study also finds that implementing collective management among migrant farmers in a neoliberal manner could help address village governance challenges brought by them but is not conducive to their social integration into the hosting societies.","[Huang, Zuyu] Hunan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, 1 South Lushan Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Huang, ZY (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, 1 South Lushan Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zuyuhuang@hnu.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China [531118010404],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China,This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China (531118010404).,,51,0,0,10,23,INST LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT MARIBOR,MARIBOR,"SMETANOVA ULICA 30, MARIBOR, 2000, SLOVENIA",1581-5374,1855-363X,,LEX LOCALIS,Lex Localis-J.

Concessional bargaining in day-to-day interactions generates goodwill, which helps smoothen future dealings amongst farmers as well as with outside agents. In particular, we model the existence of goodwill amongst farmers as enhancing their ability to collectively bargain with an outside dealer that buys their farm produce. Results suggest that when dealing with each other, farmers offer higher concessions when the risk of loss or reversal in bargaining power is high; however, the level of concession is also influenced by the degree of reciprocity and parameters that affect bargaining surplus. Findings provide further insights over the success of cooperative institutions in rural farm settings where inter-farmer goodwill dynamics determines the cooperative's bargaining outcomes. Specifically, when farmers generously reciprocate each other's goodwill gestures, it leads to better outcomes through increasing their cooperative reservation price. In contrast, when the degree of reciprocity is lower, or when the risk of bargaining power switching is higher, farmers extract more surplus from other farmers, and this also lowers the cooperative's bargaining outcomes and makes the cooperative arrangement unviable in the long term.","[Ranjan, Ram] Macquarie Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Ranjan, R (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",ram.ranjan@mq.edu.au,,"ranjan, ram/0000-0002-8756-9392",,,,,36,1,1,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

This paper discusses efforts made by six IARCs (CIAT, ICARDA, ICRISAT, IITA, ILRI, WARDA) to support the seed sector in their respective mandate regions. ICARDA is the only IARC with a currently functional seed unit. However, all IARCs participate in seed sector improvement in various ways, e.g., production of small quantities of breeder/basic seed; technical advice on seed production to NARS, public and private companies, NGOs, and farmers' cooperatives; monitoring adoption and seed production of released varieties; assessing constraints to seed multiplication and marketing; training of seed sector staff; information dissemination through brochures and seed production manuals; and provision of policy advice to governments.","IITA, GTZ, Promot Seed Prod & Mkt Project, KIA, Accra, Ghana",,"van Gastel, AJG (corresponding author), IITA, GTZ, Promot Seed Prod & Mkt Project, KIA, POB 9698, Accra, Ghana.",,"Bishaw, Zewdie/R-3099-2019",,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,INT CROPS RESEARCH INST SEMI-ARID TROPICS,ANDHRA PRADESH,"ICRISAT PATANCHERU P O, ANDHRA PRADESH 502 324, INDIA",,,92-9066-380-4,,,,1997,,,,,,,71,79,,,,,,9,Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BK58Q,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000072625100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, the study aimed to establish factors that members perceive to be critical to their success, and to assess their contribution to the AMCOS performance. The study identified factors through intensive literature review, then refining them before testing them through survey to members and employed survey by distributing 334 questionnaires to members to the AMCOS that have the autonomy to do business directly without dependingon their umbrella institutions. Qualitative data were also used in order to validate the quantitative data. Data from survey were analysed by factor analysis in order to have factors which were mostly accepted by the AMCOS members. After categorising the factors obtained from the factor analysis, regression analysis was conducted to assess their influence on the performance. Qualitative data were analysed using content Analysis by the help of ATLAS Software. The study established Eleven (11) CSFs that were categorised into: commitment (use of personal skills, members' control and promotion), governance (measurement system, governance structure, leadership support, and transparency), strategy (self-evaluation, objective development, strategy focused, living the vision of the institution). The study found the CSFs to have positive significant influence on the primary AMCOS performance. The study concludes that members of the primary AMCOS do have their common factors which they believe to be key for the success of their institutions, that affect positively the performance of their cooperatives. The study recommends that, the CSFs suggested by the members should be given priority in any decision that is intended to affect the cooperatives that can be easily translated according to their expectations to have strong institutions.","[Shirima, Victor] Moshi Cooperat Univ, Dept Banking Accounting & Finance, POB 474, Moshi, Tanzania; [Shirima, Victor] Moshi Cooperat Univ, Dept Banking Accounting & Finance, Moshi, Tanzania",,"Shirima, V (corresponding author), Moshi Cooperat Univ, Dept Banking Accounting & Finance, POB 474, Moshi, Tanzania.",Shirima.victor.shirima@mocu.ac.tz,,,Moshi Co-operative University (MoCU),Moshi Co-operative University (MoCU),"I would like to acknowledge that, this work was supported by Moshi Co-operative University (MoCU) as my employer and Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) for publication training",,69,1,1,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1975,,,COGENT BUS MANAG,Cogent Bus.

Economic (e.g. new ownerships), technological (innovations throughout the whole chain), political and institutional (liberalization) and cultural (e.g. in consumption and farming) changes have reconfigured the landscapes of chicken meat production, opening up new opportunities for the chicken industry. Chicken therefore makes a particularly good case for exploring recent major changes in the agri-food system. In this chapter, we investigate evolving rules, risks, challenges and opportunities in and around chicken meat value chains.

In Papua New Guinea, productive partnerships flourished during the early growth of the coffee industry. After the demise of plantations and rural mills in the lead up to political independence, the support services that plantations used to provide to smallholders, including centralised processing, have ceased as have price incentives for quality. Consequently, smallholders began to produce coffee of inconsistent quality and their productivity has also declined. However, coffee value chain partnerships have the potential to reverse the present decline of coffee production and increase the productivity of coffee farmers and address the inconsistency and the supply of low-grade coffee. Using two case studies of farmer cooperatives, we investigate collective action and also assess partnerships among present value chain actors. The case studies were supported with interviews of value chain actors to gain further insights into partnerships with farmer groups. This paper illustrates that through collective action and partnerships, coffee farmers can improve coffee production and quality, enhance governance systems in grower groups, attract community development services and diversify into other entrepreneurial activities.","[Sengere, Reuben W.] Coffee Ind Corp, Coffee Res Inst, Aiyura, Eastern Highlan, Papua N Guinea; [Curry, George N.; Koczberski, Gina] Curtin Univ, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia",Curtin University,"Curry, GN (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.",g.curry@curtin.edu.au,,"Curry, George/0000-0001-5528-3122",Curtin University; CIC Ltd of PNG,Curtin University; CIC Ltd of PNG,"This paper is derived from the principal author's doctoral thesis and from the ACIAR project: 'Improving Livelihoods of Smallholder Families through Increased Productivity of Coffee-based Farming Systems in the Highlands of PNG' (ASEM/2008/036).

Yet such initiatives are also regulatory mechanisms that establish voluntary alternative arrangements for governing production, commercialization and consumption of global commodities. Based on a recent study of fair trade coffee experiences in Latin America, this paper explores the changes that fair trade represents in governance of the coffee commodity chain. It argues that fair trade coffee governance is shaped both by formal organizational arrangements for coordination and control and, less formally, by the social and political relations embedded in fair trade's commodity chain. Fair trade's alternative governance arrangements represent one of the initiative's major accomplishments but also pose some of its most significant challenges for the future.

Using a policy arrangements approach, we analyse how farmers experienced the transformations brought about by the reform and how it influenced their day-to-day activities. The new farmer cooperatives established after the reform were trusted by farmers. Many farmers returned to the sector, increasing cotton output. Nevertheless, productivity remained low, around 900kg/ha, probably because the reform addressed mainly institutional constraints. Technical constraints relating to varietal choice, soil fertility improvement, and pest management were neglected. The policy arrangements emerging from the reform still generate discussion, in particular about the way actors and coalitions are organized. The top-down approach of the reform process has limitations for problem-solving, especially where actors' interests collide. The adjustments made under the reform with regard to farmer-based organizations and actors from public services, the caution solidaire, and farmers' supervision proved inappropriate for solving the institutional problems posed at the nodes of actors and coalitions, resources, discourses, and institutions, thereby further undermining the cotton sector. A mix of technological and institutional reforms might offer a more effective option for the future.","[Togbe, Codjo Euloge; Vodouhe, Simplice Davo; Zannou, Elisabeth Tohouede; Guedenon, Ange; Kossou, Dansou K.] Univ Abomey Calavi UAC, Fac Sci Agron FSA, Abomey Calavi, Benin; [Togbe, Codjo Euloge; Haagsma, Rein] Wageningen Univ WUR, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gbehounou, Gualbert] Inst Natl Rech Agr Benin INRAB, Ctr Rech Agr Coton & Fibre CRA CF, Cotonou, Benin; [Togbe, Codjo Euloge; van Huis, Arnold] Wageningen Univ WUR, Lab Entomol, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Abomey Calavi; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Togbé, CE (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi UAC, Fac Sci Agron FSA, Abomey Calavi, Benin.",togbe74@yahoo.fr,,"Togbe, Euloge/0000-0002-1641-0480",Netherlands' Directorate-General for International Cooperation of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affair (DGIS/BUZA) through Convergence of Sciences-Strengthening Innovation Systems (CoS-SIS programme),Netherlands' Directorate-General for International Cooperation of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affair (DGIS/BUZA) through Convergence of Sciences-Strengthening Innovation Systems (CoS-SIS programme),Thanks are due to the critical remarks and suggestions by the anonymous reviewers.

This research investigates the social responsiveness (CSR2) approaches implemented by credit unions during the pandemic, the type of actions implemented, the stakeholders assisted, and whether the size of credit unions may affect their responses. Data were collected from the 100 largest credit unions from nine Canadian provinces and assessed through qualitative content analysis. Results show that Canadian credit unions have implemented accommodative and proactive approaches when addressing COVID-19, through more operational than financial actions directed to their clients and employees, and that those with larger assets implement a greater number of actions compared to credit unions with smaller assets. More importantly, results show that traditional CSR2 approaches (e.g., RDAP) do not fit unexpected crises, so novel approaches are required to face future crises and remain resilient. While we aim to contribute to the body of literature by examining how credit unions have assisted their stakeholders during the pandemic, we also, and most importantly, seek to provide material for discussing and reflecting on how organizations are prepared to face crises that will likely arise in the future.","[Al-Zyoud, Hussein] Athabasca Univ, Fac Business, Athabasca, AB, Canada; [Ordonez-Ponce, Eduardo] Athabasca Univ, Fac Business, Management Engn & Sustainabil, Athabasca, AB, Canada",Athabasca University; Athabasca University,"Al-Zyoud, H (corresponding author), Athabasca Univ, Fac Business, 201,13220 St Albert Trail, Edmonton, AB T5L 4W1, Canada.",husseina@athabascau.ca; eduardo.ordonez@athabascau.ca,"Al-zyoud, Hussein/O-8222-2017","Al-zyoud, Hussein/0000-0001-5980-8133; Ordonez-Ponce, Eduardo/0000-0003-4564-9498",,,,,90,1,1,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0045-3609,1467-8594,,BUS SOC REV,Bus.

That is, we will determine whether its application will increase the bank's assertiveness in identifying credit unions whose managers have taken discretionary actions which diverge from regulatory standards Method: Benford's Law was applied to all singular Brazilian credit unions from 2006 to 2017 - which is a relevant timeframe due to regulatory changes - for Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Cash, and LPCSL (Loss Provisions for Client/Credit accounts which have Suspicious Liquidations) accounts over various timeframes. Relevance: The discussed evidence offers elements that can improve regulation mechanisms, and it can also indicate whether managers are using their discretionary power to influence singular credit union performance Results: Time is an important factor in the use of this tool. Applications applied over a long period of time do not capture discretionary actions taken by managers due to potential adjustments made to variations over time. An annual timeframe makes it possible to use this technique to capture potential discretionary actions taken in the examined accounts. In addition, this technique generates a consistent list of credit unions which require more intense surveillance and/or investigation. It also indicates that the norms revised in 2015 have helped reduce incentives to manage earnings and/or commit fraud in these organizations. Methodological Contributions: This study fills a gap in the credit union literature because there are few studies of discretionary actions in these organizations such as accounting choices, earnings management, fraud, or errors. Our findings may also indicate adjustments made by credit unions to comply with the sector standard due to the adoption of Resolutions No. 4,434 and No. 4,454. Benford's Law is useful as a tool in selecting audit samples, and it can also improve the work of supervisory bodies.","[Theodoro, Ricardo; Grespan Bonacim, Carlos Alberto; de Moura Costa, Davi Rogerio] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Theodoro, R (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",rtheodoro@usp.br; carlosbonacim@usp.br; drmouracosta@usp.br,"Theodoro, Ricardo/IUM-5139-2023","Theodoro, Ricardo/0000-0001-6741-5153",,,,,40,0,0,1,7,"UNIV BRASILIA, BUS ADM DEPT",BRASILIA,"CAMPUS DARCY RIBEIRO, BRASILIA, DF 70910-90, BRAZIL",1984-3925,,,CONTAB GEST GOV,Contab.

Revenue-sharing contracts offer a risk-sharing approach to ensure supply chain coordination and optimize profit for all. Research on short life cycle products with revenue-sharing contracts assume stable prices or investigate the effects of revenue-sharing contracts on supply chain coordination. This study introduced a revenue-sharing contract model into a 'farmer-supermarket direct-purchase' supply chain, considering price fluctuation and retail promotional efforts, stochastic market demand, among other factors. Revenue-sharing contracts achieved long-term stability in supply chain coordination, all participants obtained more profits, and the size of revenue-sharing parameter depends on the position and bargaining power of all participants. A case study on Tianhong supermarket and Nanxia farmer cooperative verified these findings, eliciting practical implications for professionals and policymakers.","[Liang, Peng; Sima, Melat; Sun, Xiaoyu] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, 33 Fucheng Rd, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yu] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Int & Comparat Educ, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China",Beijing Technology & Business University; Beijing Normal University,"Huang, Y (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Int & Comparat Educ, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China.",huangyu@bnu.edu.cn,"Huang, Yu/HGT-8126-2022",,"National Social Science Fund of China [BDA200079, 21BJY192]; Beijing Social Science Fund [20JCB003]; Beijing Philosophy and Socail Science Capital Circulation Industry Research Center [JD-YB-2021-050]",National Social Science Fund of China; Beijing Social Science Fund; Beijing Philosophy and Socail Science Capital Circulation Industry Research Center,"This research was funded by National Social Science Fund of China (No. 21BJY192), Beijing Social Science Fund (No.20JCB003), Beijing Philosophy and Socail Science Capital Circulation Industry Research Center (No.JD-YB-2021-050) and National Social Science Fund of China (No. BDA200079)",,25,5,5,15,50,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

This cooperative is dominated by a small stratum of large producers with close links to the Pamol management and the state. Although they are the most important contract farmers in terms of quantity and quality of produce, they are most dependent on the management for their supply of inputs, as well as for transport, processing and marketing facilities. Little wonder that they were the farmers who formed a co-operative in the early 1980s, when deteriorating market conditions for palm oil threatened the company's continuing existence and the farmers' chances for capital accumulation. Unable to force the management to keep to the terms of the contract, the executive board of the co-operative tried to achieve a larger measure of autonomy vis-a-vis the company by creating nurseries and transport and processing facilities of its own.","African Studies Ctr, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands",,"Konings, P (corresponding author), African Studies Ctr, POB 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-6150,1743-9361,,J PEASANT STUD,J.

Consistent with agency theory, prior studies of credit unions report an association among individual monitoring mechanisms, trade association monitoring, and female board representation, respectively, and reduced loan losses. This study provides a more nuanced understanding by investigating the moderating influence of these monitoring mechanisms on the relationship between loan losses and deprivation and by considering the effect of bundle combinations of different levels of the two monitoring mechanisms on loan losses. The results reveal that credit unions subject to trade association monitoring have the lowest loan losses. However, in the absence of trade association monitoring, female board representation has a moderating effect on loan losses as deprivation increases. Finally, trade association monitoring and female board representation have a substitutive, rather than a complementary effect on loan losses.","[Ward, Anne Marie] Ulster Univ, Accounting, Jordanstown, North Ireland; [Forker, John] Univ Sussex, Business & Management, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Reilly, Barry] Univ Sussex, Econometr, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Ulster University; University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Ward, AM (corresponding author), Ulster Univ, Jordanstown BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland.",am.ward@ulster.ac.uk,"Reilly, Barry/AAN-8101-2021","Reilly, Barry/0000-0003-0606-4585; Ward, Anne Marie/0000-0002-6756-616X",Chartered Accountant Ireland Education Trust,Chartered Accountant Ireland Education Trust,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors are grateful to the Chartered Accountant Ireland Education Trust for funding in support of this study.",,38,1,1,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0899-7640,1552-7395,,NONPROF VOLUNT SEC Q,Nonprofit Volunt.

Local councils may work with credit unions to promote financial wellbeing for social housing tenants. People at risk of eviction appear to have a greater inability to repay loans than a credit union's regular membership. However, many recipients do repay loans and their repayments permit the credit union to help others who are also vulnerable to eviction. Spreading the cost of supporting people at risk of eviction through local authority grants to credit unions, or through local authorities' underwriting of losses created by such groups, provides a means to share the risk of financial initiatives that prevent housing exclusion and promote financial inclusion. The authors are an academic and a credit union manager who was previously a housing officer for a local council. This paper examines the merits of homeless prevention loans offered by a credit union in the UK to the tenants of its housing association partners. Using a theoretical framework informed by the idea that social inclusion and social exclusion are multidimensional and dynamic, with each dimension impacting on all others, the paper examines the potential impact of loans of this type on both housing tenure and financial inclusion. The paper provides a rare case study of a credit union in the disciplines of accounting and financial management.","[Lee, Bill] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Carlisle, Liam] Lewisham Plus Credit Union Ltd, London, England",University of Sheffield,"Lee, B (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,"Lee, Bill/0000-0003-2656-4106",,,,,49,2,2,4,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0954-0962,1467-9302,,PUBLIC MONEY MANAGE,Public Money Manage.,JAN 2,2020,40,1,,,,,63,71,,10.1080/09540962.2019.1621050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540962.2019.1621050,,JUN 2019,9,Public Administration,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Public Administration,JR6SW,,Green Accepted,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000473041100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing upon qualitative and statistical analysis, this study examines the establishment of credit unions across indigenous villages in Taiwan, where both of these traditional authority structures are present. The analysis shows that villages characterized by ascribed power and inherited hierarchy (chief villages) provide less structural support for the founding and operation of credit unions and are less likely to adopt credit unions than communities whose leadership is determined by individual merits and achievement (big man villages). This finding suggests that existing authority structures in these traditional societies constrain incentive schemes and trust structures critical to the founding and persistence of new economic organizations.","[Lu, Wan-Zi] Polonsky Acad Adv Study Humanities & Social Sci, Leer Jerusalem Inst, 43 Jabotinsky St, IL-9214116 Jerusalem, Israel; [Lee, Zong-Rong] Acad Sinica, Inst Sociol, 8F,South Wing,Humanities & Social Sci Bldg,128,Se, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Lu, WZ (corresponding author), Polonsky Acad Adv Study Humanities & Social Sci, Leer Jerusalem Inst, 43 Jabotinsky St, IL-9214116 Jerusalem, Israel.",wanzilu@uchicago.edu; zlee@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,102,0,0,0,0,PRESSES SCIENCES PO,PARIS,"28 Rue Saint Guillaume, PARIS, FRANCE",0035-2969,1958-5691,,REV FR SOCIOL,Rev.

In addition, we find that credit unions with higher earnings before the loan loss provision engaged in more downward earnings management than credit unions with lower earnings before provision.

To what extent do U.S. credit unions follow cooperative principles, reflect the cooperative identity, and distinguish themselves from other financial institutions? As credit unions grow and diversify their membership, many argue that credit unions will lose their cooperative identity and become more akin to their counterparts in the for-profit banking sector. This paper presents evidence that U.S. credit unions continue to differentiate themselves from other forms of banks. In their governance structure, credit unions rely on volunteer directors and CEOs are significantly less incentivized by performance-based compensation relative to commercial bank CEOs. Moreover, 51 % of credit union CEOs are female versus only 3% of CEOs at similarly sized community banks. Credit unions also offer better interest rates, provide higher quality loans, avoid overly risky lending practices (e.g., subprime mortgages), and are more likely to open and retain branches in low-income and diverse areas.","[van Rijn, Jordan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 318 Taylor Hall,427 Lorch St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [van Rijn, Jordan] CUNA, Madison, WI USA; [van Rijn, Jordan] NCBA Council Cooperat Econ, Washington, DC USA; [van Rijn, Jordan] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Financial Secur, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"van Rijn, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 318 Taylor Hall,427 Lorch St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",vanrijn@wisc.edu,,,,,,,62,2,2,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

They play a major role in providing micro-credits in many regions. At the end of 2014, there were 57 408 credit unions in 105 countries with more than 217.4 million members and approximately USD 1792.94 billion assets. This indicates on the necessity to analyse the performance of credit unions. The research aim is to identify the features and performance characteristics of the credit unions based on a particular insight into the operation of credit unions in the Baltic States. It was concluded that in many countries credit unions were operating at a loan-to-asset ratio which was much lower than the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) requirements. Among the Baltic States, Lithuania is the leader in terms of credit unions as it almost twice outpaces Latvia, while Estonia considerably lags behind. In Latvia, credit unions have managed to preserve a stable increase related to attraction of savings and deposits. This means that the members trust credit unions and see the significance and convenience joining them. Similar conclusions may be drawn regarding the amount of disbursed loans.","[Mazure, Gunita] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Mazure, G (corresponding author), Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",Gunita.Mazure@llu.lv,"Mazure, Gunita/AAA-7586-2020","Mazure, Gunita/0000-0002-3722-9437",,,,,16,1,1,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43,,,,,,323,332,,,,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000391253200039,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article finds that credit union entry responds in a similar way, and in addition that the state-level financial regulatory climate matters. An ordered-probit analysis of credit union numbers yields the intuitive result that credit unions possess little market power (even in rural markets where they might be expected to play a significant role), and what little there is can likely be eliminated by a third credit union in the market.","American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Feinberg, RM (corresponding author), American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",feinber@american.edu,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853",,,,,21,14,14,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Responding to high charge-off rates for these loans and concern for systemic risk, the National Credit Union Administration imposed in 2013 new rules on federally insured credit unions that limited the purchase of loan participations from a single originator to the greater of $5 million or 100% of net worth. This study uses a difference-in-difference framework to examine the effect the policy had on returns. As a result of the policy change, credit unions with a high share of net worth in loan participations earned, on average, a return on assets 47 basis points less than their counterparts. Further, we find evidence that suggests these lower returns were driven by a decline in participation loans with recourse provisions, liquidity issues, and relatively higher interest expenses.

An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80%) and high gains (50.20%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers' improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State.","[Uddin, Md Ektear] Patuakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Dev, Dumki, Patuakhali, Bangladesh; [Pervez, A.

This paper analyzes how differences in incentive structure constrain the attractiveness of interest-rate speculation and other risk-taking opportunities to managers and regulators of credit unions. Despite these better incentives, robust present-value calculations establish that NCUSIF fell into economic insolvency during the mid-1980s. Besides calculating the extent of this insolvency, the paper also seeks to explain why, after NCUSIF became insolvent, it could rebuild its reserves without an explicit or implicit taxpayer bailout. Our explanation turns on cross-industry coinsurance responsibilities and the shallowness of the fund's observed insolvency relative to industry net worth. We identify forces in the decisionmaking environment tending to limit the depth and duration of unresolved insolvencies at individual credit unions. Managerial opportunities to benefit personally from taking risks that would flow through to NCUSIF are constrained by difficulties in converting a credit union to stockholder form and by the intensity of proactive monitoring of troubled credit unions by sister institutions and other private coinsurers. We conjecture that expanded use of coinsurance and private monitoring could reduce taxpayer loss exposure elsewhere in government deposit insurance systems.","SANTA CLARA UNIV, DEPT FINANCE, SANTA CLARA, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Kane, EJ (corresponding author), BOSTON COLL, DEPT FINANCE, CHESTNUT HILL, MA 02167 USA.",,,"Kane, Edward/0000-0002-9238-8705",,,,,28,28,29,1,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4266,1872-6372,,J BANK FINANC,J.

Production has declined by 50% over the past 25 years despite efforts by initiatives. This study tries to unravel what drives coffee production in Kenya. Data were collected on six cooperatives through household interviews and discussions with farmers, cooperative officials, and key informants. Yields ranged from ten to 3889 kg/ha/year, averaged 474 kg/ha/year and were positively correlated with intensity of crop management (r = 0.09, P < 0.05). Coffee represented about 25-50% of total household income. The oldest farmers (average 63 years) were poorer, had less diversified income sources and managed coffee less intensively than younger farmers. Intensity of management differed among cooperatives and was positively correlated with trust in the cooperative (r = 0.209, P < 0.001). Households that received credit from marketers were 30% more likely to use fertilizers than other households. We show that the yield gap can be closed by existing practices, and intensification is influenced by household characteristics and services received. We conclude that increasing the participation of young farmers in coffee production and creating an enabling environment for intensification can have a positive and sustainable effect on national production.","[Wairegi, Lydia W.

With the aim of improving locally available small-scale drying equipment, the performance of a litchi batch-dryer by a farmers' cooperative near Chiang Mai was studied. Drying conditions, energy consumption and product quality were monitored over three trials. Energy performance was analysed using instantaneous indices, leading to suggestions for possible design-modifications. About 29.8% of the heat input was used for moisture evaporation, 38.4% was lost via unsaturated exhaust air and 17.6% was lost to the ambient environment. An optimum air flow rate, one that minimises exhaust heat losses without increasing the drying time, was calculated. Temperature and air flow within the drying chamber varied, resulting in a non-uniform batch.

Adherence to these standards was required under a federal marketing order that applied to essentially all tomatoes grown in Florida. The California Tomato Farmers cooperative, whose members produced the vast majority of fresh tomatoes grown in California, also required that its members adopt these standards. The collective food-safety standards for fresh tomatoes closely resemble the requirements of the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule, so the collective adoption of these standards provides an excellent case study to illustrate the possible effects of FSMA implementation on demand. I assess the hypothesis that demand for tomatoes from Florida and California increased following the adoption of standards for food-safety practices by growers in those states, relative to demand for tomatoes from other regions. My analysis demonstrates essentially no evidence that demand for fresh tomatoes responded positively to the implementation of collective food-safety practices.","[Bovay, John] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Bovay, J (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",john.bovay@uconn.edu,,,USDA-Economic Research Service [58-4000-0-0047]; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics,USDA-Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics,"This article benefitted from the helpful comments of Julian Alston, Richard Sexton, Daniel Sumner, and Wei Zhang, as well as the editor, Awudu Abdulai, and anonymous referees.

Limited access to external equity capital means that capital accumulation Must be met primarily by reliance oil retained earnings. To deal with shocks to the capital position and avoid breaching regulatory requirements, managers will aim to have a buffer of capital in excess of the regulatory minimum. Moreover, mutual governance arrangements and ail absence of capital market discipline mean that managers have discretion to set target capital ratios which differ significantly from industry averages. This paper develops a formal model of capital management and risk management in mutual financial institutions such as credit unions which reflects these industry characteristics. The model is tested using data from larger credit unions in Australia, which have been subject to the Basel Accord Risk Weighted Capital Requirements since 1993. The data supports the hypothesis that credit unions manage their capital position by setting a short term target profit rate (return oil assets) which is positively related to asset growth and which is aimed at gradually removing discrepancies between the actual and desired capital ratio. Desired capital ratios vary significantly across credit unions. There is little evidence of short run adjustments to the risk of the asset portfolio to achieve a desired capital position.

The study objective was to quantify effectiveness of individual conservation practice or practice combinations on water quality on corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] watersheds. Water samples from northern Missouri farms were collected and analyzed by runoff event for sediment (total suspended solids [TSS]), N, and P to evaluate the effects of crop production, residue types, and conservation land treatment on runoff. The presence of living vegetation in the winter, whether established as a cover crop or cash crop, significantly reduced the sediment loads (p < .0001) and nutrient loads (p <= .0077). Additional benefits occurred on sites that produced higher residues, like corn or corn with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Significantly low TSS losses occurred during soybean years with corn and winter wheat residues. Sites that implemented full land treatment, having conservation practices that serve to avoid, control, and trap a pollutant, were more effective than those with fewer treatments, especially with respect to P loading. The mean rank for orthophosphates was 45% lower from sites with avoid, control, and trap practices instead of control practices only. Data support the conclusion that conservation structural and management practices are effective and can mitigate some negative impacts generated by agriculture. Although an intricate endeavor, edge-of-field water quality monitoring can serve to complement other forms of environmental analysis and inform landowners about efficient farming practices.","[Udawatta, Ranjith P.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Udawatta, Ranjith P.; Jose, Shibu] Univ Missouri, Ctr Agroforestry, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Hefner, Steven; Brinkman, Karen] USDA NRCS, Parkade Ctr, Suite 250,601 Business Loop 70 West, Columbia, MO 65203 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Udawatta, RP (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",udawattar@missouri.edu,,,USDANRCS,USDANRCS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors would like to express sincere gratitude to the citizen cooperators for participating in the studies and providing access for sample collection and analysis.

One issue underlying the nature of competition between the two, however, concerns the most appropriate way to model their interactions. Two possible approaches are the dominant-firm price-leadership model and the generalized Cournot model. In the former model, credit unions act as fringe suppliers who are price-takers in a homogeneous product market. In the latter, they possess (limited) market power. One way to distinguish the two is by examining the impact of credit union market shares on their pricing, as the two models imply differing effects. Our results are more consistent with the ``credit unions as fringe suppliers'' view. Using a pooled cross-section time series of 77 small local consumer lending markets throughout the U.S., each with 10 observations over 5 years, the focus is on a loan product ex ante thought to be sold in local markets, unsecured (non-credit card) loans. For this product, increasing credit union market shares reduces credit union loan rates, consistent with a fringe supplier hypothesis.","American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Feinberg, RM (corresponding author), American Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853",,,,,16,11,11,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Credit unions have a rich history. Some, however, adhere more closely to their historical roots than others. These credit unions base their philosophy on the premise that members, in a voluntary capacity, actively participate in the governance and the running of the credit union; and that the credit union should not develop beyond a size and level of financial sophistication at which individual members can fully contribute in this capacity. Other credit unions have strayed far from their historical roots. Moreover the analysis of contemporary credit unions conceptions and problems of management improvement are performed. In addition theoretical priorities for credibility and international capabilities of credit unions are presented. A sketch of some actual theories is being performed and methods for analysis of credit unions' activities are particularly composed. Following method of improvement of observational research was performed in this paper. In order to evaluate common tendencies of activities of the credit unions in the World and particularly in the European Union the financial institutions' legal regulations are specially surveyed. Furthermore legal regulations of credit unions are analyzed in practice for local and international credit unions of Lithuania. The preliminary evaluation of the credit unions activity in the circumstances of contemporary waves of the financial crisis is presented.

In the first stage, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to calculate technical and scale efficiency indices for a sample of credit unions. The second stage uses a multinomial logit model to relate credit union efficiency scores, along with other managerial, regulatory and financial factors, to the probability of credit unions acquiring or being acquired by another credit union. The results indicate that asset size and quality, management ability, earnings and liquidity are a significant influence on the level of M&A. One primary influence on credit union acquisitions would appear to be the perceived compatibility in associational bond and membership. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

With the objective of responding to several of the most important questions facing agriculture today, this article describes recent research in three Cuban cropping systems: state farms, cooperatives, and small family farmers. Soil management is considered here as a crux of human intervention in agroecosystems, capable of determining the impacts of productive activities upon agricultural and ecosystem functions. Management practices commonly used in each farm system are evaluated using two systems of indicators, one for technological quality and one for agricultural intensification. Soil physical quality is characterized through laboratory analysis of samples taken in the same type of soil under long-term production in state, cooperative, and family farmer cropping systems. Soil structure management in the small farmer system is especially worthy of study, because this agricultural system has developed an intensive agroecological productive model on the basis of low external input use, polycultures and internal nutrient cycling. Favorable policies and farmer organizations are discussed as indispensible elements of sustainable agricultural development. The relationships between soil management, local knowledge, and food access are explored in the Cuban context and as directions for food system studies.","[McCune, Nils Max; D'Haese, Marijke; DeNeve, Stefaan] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-900 Ghent, Belgium; [Ruiz Gonzalez, Yanetsy; Aguila Alcantara, Edith; Fernandez Martinez, Osvaldo; Onelio Fundora, Calixto; Cairo Cairo, Pedro] Univ Cent Marta Abreu Las Villas, Fac Agron Sci, Santa Clara, Cuba; [Castillo Arzola, Niria] Univ Ciego Avila, Fac Humanities, Ciego De Avila, Cuba; [Guevara Hernandez, Francisco] Autonomous Univ Chiapas, Fac Agron Sci, Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico",Ghent University; Universidad Central Marta Abreu de Las Villas; University of Ciego de Avila; Universidad Autonoma de Chiapas,"McCune, NM (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Coupure Links 653, B-900 Ghent, Belgium.",saludcampesina@yahoo.com.mx,"Guevara-Hernandez, Francisco/D-9621-2011; Aguila Alcantara, Edith/GZH-1251-2022","Guevara-Hernandez, Francisco/0000-0002-1444-6324; Aguila Alcantara, Edith/0000-0001-9468-6717; McCune, Nils/0000-0001-9040-9595; D'Haese, Marijke/0000-0002-0544-3420",,,,,29,17,21,0,61,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1044-0046,1540-7578,,J SUSTAIN AGR,J.

However, small and marginal farmers are facing challenges while adopting biopesticides, namely, high cost and complicated application techniques, resulting in a low level of farmer acceptance. Accordingly, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), voluntarily formed by farmers, develop mutual technical assistance among their members to solve the technical problems of biopesticide adoption. This study assumes that as a new form of farmer cooperative, FPOs have the potential to promote biopesticide adoption through the implementation of collective pesticide adoption (CPA). Along this line, this paper uses a cooperative game-based hybrid method to develop an incentive mechanism of biopesticide adoption for FPOs to implement CPAs. First, we construct a CPA decision model for mixed pesticides (i.e., biopesticides and chemical pesticides) based on multichoice goal programming (MCGP) to compromise the conflicting objectives regarding cost efficiency and chemical residue reduction, thereby obtaining the optimal total cost of pesticide adoption. Second, recognizing the optimal total adoption cost as a baseline, we devise a cooperative game-based cost allocation scheme to maintain farmers' voluntary participation in FPOs. This study demonstrates that the CPA implemented based on our proposed models can at least match if not surpass the economic and environmental performance of farmers' independent pesticide adoption (IPA). We further demonstrate that the proposed cooperative game solution is more suitable for the FPO's cost allocation issue than the eminent solutions, such as the Shapley value.","[Zheng, Xiao-Xue] Minjiang Univ, Newhuadu Business Sch, 200 Xiyuangong Rd, Fuzhou City 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jingwen; Zhang, Shiyuan] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 66 Xuefu Ave, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Jia, Fu] Univ York, York Management Sch, Supply Chain Management, York YO10 5DD, England",Minjiang University; Chongqing Jiaotong University; University of York - UK,"Zhang, SY (corresponding author), Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 66 Xuefu Ave, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Jia, F (corresponding author), Univ York, York Management Sch, Supply Chain Management, York YO10 5DD, England.",zhengxiaoxue@nbs.edu.cn; 1195331624@qq.com; fu.jia@york.ac.uk; 611210120009@mails.cqjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72001041]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [20YJC630230]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2022J02051]; Undergraduate Education and Teaching Reform Research Project of Fujian Province [FBJG20210229]; Research Centre of Efficiency and Productivity Fujian College?s Research Base of Humanities and Social Science Fujian, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Undergraduate Education and Teaching Reform Research Project of Fujian Province; Research Centre of Efficiency and Productivity Fujian College?s Research Base of Humanities and Social Science Fujian, China","Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant #: 72001041) , Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (20YJC630230) , the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (Grant #: 2022J02051) , Undergraduate Education and Teaching Reform Research Project of Fujian Province (Grant #: FBJG20210229) and Research Centre of Efficiency and Productivity Fujian College?s Research Base of Humanities and Social Science Fujian, China.",,58,3,3,16,43,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Key principles identified for effective PAR agroecological processes include a shared interest in research by partners, a belief in collective power/action, a commitment to participation, practicing humility and establishing trust and accountability. Important lessons to consider for future work include: (1) research processes that did not start as PAR, can evolve into it; (2) farmer/stakeholder participation in setting the research agenda, from the outset, results in higher engagement and enhanced outcomes; (3) having the right partners for the desired outcomes is key; (4) intentional and explicit reflection is an essential component of PAR processes; and (5) cross-generational collaborations are crucial to long-term benefits. Key challenges that confront PAR processes include the need for time and resources over longer periods; the complexity of multi-actor process facilitation; and institutional barriers within the academy and development organizations, which prevent shifting investment towards integrated PAR agroecological processes.","[Mendez, V.

Design/methodology/approach - We surveyed the literature to identify different performance metrics of credit unions and a set of possible factors that might affect their performance. We collected data related to different dependent and independent variables from financial statements and balance sheets of 189 credit unions and from general websites like Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada. Then, we imputed the missing data and developed fixed effect and random effect panel data regression models. First, we used return on asset as the main dependent variable. Afterwards, we used six performance metrics to check the robustness of our models. Findings - From an initial list of 16 possible factors that might affect the financial performance of a credit union, we were able to narrow the factors down to the nine most significant ones. It was observed that credit unions in the prairies were more likely to perform well financially as compared to other provinces. Membership size, the size of a credit union in terms of total assets, capital adequacy ratio, market penetration, diversification of income, inflation rate and provincial GDP and interest rates were significant. The cross-sectional analysis performed confirmed the findings of the fixed effect panel data models. Research limitations/implications - This study has a limitation concerning the number of years included into the time series analysis. Only ten years worth of data were available. Practical implications - Results provide credit union management, service providers for credit unions and market analysts with a current understanding of how different internal and external factors might affect return on assets, return on equity, delinquency, cash ratio, efficiency ratio, asset growth and loan growth. Our models can be used to predict financial performance of credit unions based on the defined significant variables. Originality/value - Although there is a wide body of literature that studies performance of banks, not many studies focus on credit unions. Moreover, the existing studies are based on credit unions in United States or Europe, and literature on Canadian credit unions is scarce. The data collected covered 189 Canadian credit unions. To our knowledge this is the first study that looks at the various internal, external and regulatory factors together that affect the credit unions in various jurisdictions of Canada.","[Almehdawe, Eman; Khan, Saqib; Lamsal, Manish; Poirier, Angele] Univ Regina, Regina, SK, Canada",University of Regina,"Almehdawe, E (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Regina, SK, Canada.",eman.almehdawe@uregina.ca,"Poirier, Angèle/GZH-2665-2022",,Mitacs [IT09090],Mitacs,This work was generously jointly supported by Mitacs (grant no.

Credit unions are analyzed as a group and by field of membership. Specifically, this research analyzes the growth rates of assets, deposits, and loans. Design/methodology/approach This research employs univariate tests of differences to examine the median growth rates for commercial banks and credit unions. Unbalanced pool regressions analyze growth rates during the pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery periods, controlling for size, net charge-offs, and unemployment. Findings Univariate test results that control for size show that banks grow at faster rates than credit unions for most of the pre-crisis years. However, medium sized credit unions grow at faster rates for most of the crisis and recovery years. Results of unbalanced pool regressions suggest that, overall, credit unions grow at slower rates than do banks. However, during the crisis and recovery, credit union growth is significantly greater than that of banks, after controlling for net charge-offs, size, and unemployment. Credit union growth varies by field of membership type. Originality/value Although a large volume of research examines commercial bank performance around the financial crisis, only a few papers assess the performance of credit unions.

First, it analyses the income structure in cooperative financial institutions and examines how traditional and non-traditional incomes are related. Second, it evaluates whether increasing diversification towards non-traditional incomes facilitates or hampers the benefits of financial cooperative owners. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from over 3,100 US credit unions over the period of 1994-2016. A number of modern econometric techniques are employed throughout the analysis, including the use of panel fixed effect, generalised method of moments (GMM) and two-stage least square (2SLS) methodologies. Findings Using US credit unions as the empirical setting, the empirical results reveal that the expansion of traditional income leads to a corresponding increase in income from non-traditional activities. However, an increasing reliance on non-traditional income causes a significant drop in interest margins. The authors also find that the extent to which income diversification affects owner benefit varies across credit union types and period of time. While income diversification negatively affects owners' benefits in single common bond credit unions, it has no significant influence on multiple common bond and community credit union owners' benefits. Third, diversification can be beneficial during crisis time, but can be detrimental to owner benefit during normal time. Originality/value This paper provides some of the first empirical investigations on the diversification strategy of cooperative financial institutions. Therefore, the results offer significant policy implications for policymakers and market participants on whether financial cooperatives should diversify or specialise.","[Cuong, Hoang Van; Quynh Thi Nguyen, Loan; Chu, Vu Tuan] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ngoc Luu, Hiep] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Ngoc Luu, Hiep; Quynh Thi Nguyen, Loan; Chu, Vu Tuan] Ctr Appl Econ & Business Res, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam; University of St Andrews,"Luu, HN (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.;Luu, HN (corresponding author), Ctr Appl Econ & Business Res, Hanoi, Vietnam.",ecocaeb@gmail.com; nhl3@st-andrews.ac.uk; quynhloannguyen511@gmail.com; vutuanchu@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,1,1,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1743-9132,1758-6569,,INT J MANAG FINANC,Int.

It was used financial data available through the COSIF system of Central Bank of Brazil, the PEARLS model of economic-financial assessment and the classification methodology of the Brazilian Guarantee Fund for Credit Unions (FGCOOP). The rating model was estimated through multinomial logistic regression. The total accuracy was 80.1%. With the model results and considering its high accuracy degree, it is possible to verify that the use of PEARLS model allowed the development of a model for monitoring the risks that credit unions represent to financial market. The achieved rating model is simple and has a practical relevance to agents. The academic relevance is related to the methodology for economic-financial assessment of credit unions which can be a reference for future studies. Moreover, the relevance is highlighted due to lack of studies on ratings to assess financial firms in Brazil.","[Huscher, Paulo Fabricio] Banco Brasil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Moreira, Vilmar Rodrigues] PPGCOOP PUCPR, Programa Posgrad Gestao Cooperat, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Silva, Rodrigo Alves] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Central Bank of Brazil; Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana,"Huscher, PF (corresponding author), Banco Brasil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",pfh251@gmail.com; vilmar.moreira@pucpr.br; alvesr@utfpr.edu.br,,,,,,,18,1,2,0,2,EDITORA UNIV ESTADO BAHIA,BAHIA,"RUA SILVEIRA MARTINS, 2555, CABULA, SALVADOR, BAHIA, 41 150-000, BRAZIL",2238-5320,,,REV GEST FINANC CONT,Rev.

We find that, on average, households that receive auto loans from credit unions pay 0.70 percentage points less on interest rates for new vehicles-and 1.40 percentage points less on used vehicles-relative to observably similar households that receive auto loans from banks. The aggregated savings to credit union members is larger than the estimated value of the credit union corporate income tax exemption.

The analysis of the population of these acquisitions spans the paths of annual differences in CAMEL ratios. Most acquirers have a somewhat revised capital structure and are often benefiting from economies of scope, as well as economies of scale. Since their acquisitions, the acquiring credit unions have become less risky, measured by simulated CAMEL ratios, and they are lending a larger share of their deposits. There is no apparent financial reason to discourage credit unions from acquiring additional banks and savings institutions. The National Credit Union Administration does not need to be particularly hesitant to allow credit unions to acquire banks and thrifts. Design/methodology/approach Financial analysis is done via simulated CAMEL ratios. Findings After acquiring banks, credit unions are less risky and lend a greater share of their deposits.

Based on a unique sample of the 100 Canadian largest credit unions from 1996 to 2014, we find that both the risk-based capital buffer and the leverage buffer are positively related to changes in loans and loan growth. However, changes in these two types of buffers are negatively related to changes in the loans to assets ratios. This finding suggests that to adjust their capital buffers, Canadian credit unions curtail their loans and underscores the importance of the Basel III conservation and the countercyclical buffer requirements in fostering credit. Further, we show that the risk-based capital buffer is positively related to the credit cycle. However, a mechanical application of the rule based on the credit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) gap to activate the countercyclical buffer, would have misguided Canadian credit unions.","[Hessou, Helyoth] Laval Univ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lai, Van Son] Laval Univ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Lab Financial Engn, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lai, Van Son] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France",Laval University; Laval University; IPAG Business School,"Lai, VS (corresponding author), Laval Univ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Lab Financial Engn, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",helyoth.hessou.1@ulaval.ca; vanson.lai@fsa.ulaval.ca,,"Lai, Van Son/0000-0001-8763-9373",Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) (Education and Good Governance Fund) [SC-1968]; Conrad Leblanc Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) (Education and Good Governance Fund); Conrad Leblanc Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We appreciate the insights from both Brian Lucey and Sabri Boubaker.

We first provide descriptive evidence of depositor discipline in credit unions: shares and deposits as well as savings interest rates react to variables that reflect the financial health of the credit union and its asset risk. We show that this discipline is long-lasting and that it is mediated by the existence of a deposit guarantee scheme and by the strength of the relationship of members with the credit union. We then use proxies of the capability of members to process financial information to show that discipline is heavily influenced by member financial sophistication. Our results suggest that a type of market-based discipline acts as a complement for regulation in controlling credit union risk taking, thus contributing to overall financial stability.","[Gomez-Biscarri, Javier] Univ Pompeu FabraBarcelona, Dept Econ & Business, Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Espinosa, German] Univ Navarra, Sch Econ & Business, Pamplona, Spain; [Mesa-Toro, Andres] Univ Navarra, Sch Econ & Business, Pamplona 31009, Spain",University of Navarra; University of Navarra,"Mesa-Toro, A (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Sch Econ & Business, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",amesat@unav.es,"Lopez-Espinosa, German/C-8256-2017","Lopez-Espinosa, German/0000-0003-4520-0789","Asociacion de Amigos-Universidad de Navarra; Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2012-33619, ECO2016-78254]; Serra Hunter program; Barcelona GSE; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SEV-2015-0563, ECO2017-88509-P]",Asociacion de Amigos-Universidad de Navarra; Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Serra Hunter program; Barcelona GSE; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from two anonymous referees and from Claudia Girardone, Jose Berrospide, Martin Cihak, Nadia Massoud, James Wilcox, Keldon Bauer and participants at IWFSAS 2016, especially our discussant Vikas Mehrota; ICA 2016 Almeria; XXIV Foro de Finanzas, especially our discussant Javier Suarez; I PhD Workshop Universidad de Navarra.

The objective of this study was to analyze the agribusiness practices adopted by cooperatives and associations of farmers in Para state (Eastern Amazon, Brazil) and the importance they attribute to environmental conservation. The methodology consisted of remotely conducting interviews based on a questionnaire with farmer cooperatives and associations. We found that the main products produced by the cooperatives and associations were fruits and their derivatives. In addition, we identified a significant positive relationship between the operation duration of a cooperative or association and the number of products they produced. Regarding the challenges faced by cooperatives, legal challenges were most notable, while the challenges faced by associations were related to environmental issues. Notably, associa-tions and cooperatives showed low agreement considering the importance of each conservation practices analyzed. The results also suggested that the current subsidies granted to cooperatives and associations have nonsignificant impacts on the intensity of their adoption of environmental conservation practices, implying that monetary incentives are effective only with cooperatives/associations that have weaker attitudes toward the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. Agricultural policy should consider both economic support and effective and continuous programs focusing on the sustainable use of natural resources.(c) 2022 The Authors.

In this paper, we explore another plausible supply-side explanation for the growth of the industry, namely economies of diversification. We focus on the fact that credit unions differ among themselves in the range of financial services they offer to their members. Since larger credit unions tend to offer a more diversified financial service menu than credit unions of a smaller size, the incentive to grow in size may be fueled not only by present scale economies but also by economies of diversification. This paper provides the first robust estimates of such economies of diversification for the credit union sector. We estimate a flexible semiparametric smooth coefficient quantile panel data model with correlated effects that is capable of accommodating a four-way heterogeneity among credit unions. Our results indicate the presence of non-negligible economies of diversification in the industry. We find that as many as 27-91% (depending on the type and the cost quantile) of diversified credit unions enjoy substantial economies of diversification; the cost of most remaining credit unions is invariant to the scope of services. We also find overwhelming evidence of increasing returns to scale in the industry.","[Malikov, Emir] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Zhao, Shunan; Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Lib Tower 909, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA; [Zhao, Shunan] Ctr Coll Danville, Dept Econ, Danville, KY USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Kumbhakar, SC (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Lib Tower 909, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu,,"Zhao, Shunan/0000-0002-4700-9403",,,,,54,8,8,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative explorative case study of advisory services in Norway, which are structured as farmer cooperatives. Interviews, document analysis, and internet information are applied. Findings: Strong social mechanisms are needed to realise the potential AC in an organisation. Advisory organisations with incorporated research and development (R&D) can translate findings from both their own research projects and external sources, which increases their absorptive capacity and boosts service innovation. Further, systematic emphasis on continuous learning strengthens AC, as do networking and internal communications. Practical implications: By improving the incorporation of R&D, continuous learning and networking, advisory service organisations can benefit from the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS). Ultimately farmers can receive more updated and relevant services for their farms.

The general trend of the efficiency estimates shows an improving cost-efficiency accompanied by a fairly stable but declining profit-efficiency of the CCUs. Specifically, the result shows that only about 2% of costs are wasted, on average, relative to a best-practice firm facing the same conditions. Meanwhile, the mean profit estimates for the 14-year period is 92%. Credit cooperatives with a greater number of women employees are more cost- and profit-efficient. However, the dominance of women as members incurs more cost and thus less profit.

These are financial co-operatives based on low-income neighbourhoods, owned and controlled by local residents. which aim to provide savings and low-cost credit facilities to their members. Although located in economically disadvantaged communities, credit unions are not exclusively used by the poor. While better-off groups save and borrow more, a greater proportion of low-income users would not have purchased goods and services in the absence of a credit union. Credit unions are making useful but marginal contributions to the credit and debt problems of low-income families.

In this study, we investigate two research questions. First, we compare risk-taking by banks and credit unions, with an additional consideration as to how regulatory oversight (state or federal) relates to such risk-taking. Second, we examine how competition affects the difference in risk-taking between these two types of financial institutions. To answer both questions, we rely on a matched sample (by loan type, size, and county) of commercial banks and credit unions, covering the period between 2010 and 2017. We use three empirical proxies for risk-taking, the Z-score, measuring an institution's insolvency risk, as well as the ratios of non-performing loans to total loans and loan charge-offs to total loans, measuring the credit risk. Our results suggest that banks tend to engage in more risk-taking than credit unions; however, state regulatory oversight reduces the risk-taking gap, especially in terms of the Z-score. We further find that competition induces different risktaking behaviors in banks and credit unions. Our results are robust to several alternative specifications.","[Naaman, Christine] Murray State Univ, Arthur J Bauernfeind Coll Business, 130 Business Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Magnan, Michel; Hammami, Ahmad; Yao, Li] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Magnan, Michel] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Murray State University; Concordia University - Canada; Universite de Montreal,"Naaman, C (corresponding author), Murray State Univ, Arthur J Bauernfeind Coll Business, 130 Business Bldg, Murray, KY 42071 USA.",cnaaman@murraystate.edu,"Magnan, Michel/ADG-2319-2022",,"S.A.

New niche commodity markets for fine cocoa-produced by old tree varieties frequently grown in shaded agroforestry systems-create more direct linkages between producers and buyers. We explored the socioeconomic and environmental outcomes for cocoa smallholders that participated in direct trade relations compared with smallholders that sold through mainstream markets. Household interviews were conducted with cocoa smallholders in northern Ecuador. Biodiversity conditions at farm level were monitored for 75% of surveyed households. Using a counterfactual based on genetic matching, we found that smallholders engaged in direct trade (a) captured superior prices for cocoa sales; (b) had greater access to agricultural training, technical assistance, and improved social networks; and (b) applied more nature-friendly management practices, compared with smallholders selling through mainstream markets. However, a strong overlap between direct trading practices and organic certification made attribution of environmental benefits difficult. This overlap likely explained why farmers engaged in direct trade used more organic fertilizers and less herbicide. Shade level and plant species richness and abundance in plantations were unrelated to market participation. Additional qualitative analyses suggest that certification facilitates engagement in direct trade and that some direct buyers request certification. This study provides insights on the potential of developing value chain innovations for high-quality commodity trade. The success of value chain innovations hinges on the competitiveness of farmers' cooperatives and involvement of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private actors.","[Middendorp, Romaike S.; Boever, Olivia; Lambin, Eric F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Pl Louis Pasteur 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Rueda, Ximena] Univ Los Andes, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Stanford University; Stanford University,"Middendorp, RS (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Pl Louis Pasteur 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",romaike.middendorp@uclouvain.be,,"Middendorp, Romaike/0000-0002-9294-5479; Lambin, Eric/0000-0002-0673-5257","Federation Wallonie-Bruxelles, Belgium [BV 15-06]; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Belgium [FC 98876]; Federation Wallonie-Bruxelles [BV 15-06]; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique [FC 98876]","Federation Wallonie-Bruxelles, Belgium; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Belgium(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Federation Wallonie-Bruxelles; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS)","Federation Wallonie-Bruxelles, Belgium, Grant/Award Number: BV 15-06; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Belgium, Grant/Award Number: FC 98876; Federation Wallonie-Bruxelles, Grant/Award Number: BV 15-06; The Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grant/Award Number: FC 98876",,113,7,7,7,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2572-3170,,BUS STRATEGY DEV,Bus.

Since 2003, however, these limitations have been steadily relaxed, a process which has resulted in an increase in credit union business lending activity. Using data from the universe of US credit unions we provide comprehensive evidence that expansion of the business loan portfolio increases the risk of the asset side of the credit union. This is the case even for credit unions which benefit from partnership with the SBA, for which we observe an initial increase in the risk of non-SBA backed loans (an overconfidence effect) which reverses over time (a learning effect). Our results suggest, furthermore, that the risk of business loans is exacerbated for credit unions which initiate their business loan activity and which do so rapidly. In the second part of our analysis we provide descriptive and quasi-experimental evidence that expansions of credit union activity into business loans are associated with lower subsequent growth rates of deposits. This result is similar to the reaction to risk indicators found in the banking literature and might give an ex-ante incentive for the CU that could work as a market-based stabilization mechanism complementary to that of explicit regulation.","[Gomez-Biscarri, Javier] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Sch Econ, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Gomez-Biscarri, Javier] Barcelona Sch Management, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Espinosa, German] Univ Navarra, IESE Business Sch, Sch Econ, Pamplona, Spain; [Mesa-Toro, Andres] Univ Navarra, Sch Econ, Pamplona, Spain",Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University; University of Navarra; IESE Business School; University of Navarra,"Mesa-Toro, A (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Sch Econ, Pamplona, Spain.",amesat@unav.es,"Lopez-Espinosa, German/C-8256-2017","Lopez-Espinosa, German/0000-0003-4520-0789","Asociacion de Amigos - Universidad de Navarra; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PID2019-105227RB-100]; Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2012-33619, ECO2016-78254]; Spanish Ministry of Economy [ECO2017-88509-P, PID2020-118541GB-I00]; Serra Hunter Program",Asociacion de Amigos - Universidad de Navarra; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy(Spanish Government); Serra Hunter Program,"We appreciate helpful comments and suggestions from two anonymous referees, the editor Iftekhar Hasan, and from Claudia Girardone, Jose Berrospide, Martin Cihak, Nadia Massoud, James Wilcox, Keldon Bauer and participants at IWFSAS 2016, especially our discussant Vikas Mehrota; ICA 2016 Almeria; XXIV Foro de Finanzas, especially our discussant Javier Suarez; I PhD Workshop at the Universidad de Navarra and the 2017 EAA Meeting (Valencia) .

By contrast, in the EU Western countries, where farmer cooperatives are widespread and successful, agricultural cooperation in Lithuania has developed intermittently in the last century. We still have very limited knowledge of why the country's agricultural producers (especially smallholder farmers) are reluctant to cooperate in Lithuania. The aim of this study is to assess the level of the willingness to cooperate among smallholder farmers in Lithuania and to draw up the profiles of small-scale farms that participate in and intend to join cooperatives and, conversely, that do not participate in cooperatives and do not intend to do so. To achieve this goal, a representative survey of small-scale farms was conducted. Results of surveys carried out in 2019 in Lithuania on a group of 1002 small-scale farms showed that only 8% of the surveyed farms participate in producer groups or cooperatives, while another 8% intend to participate. Small-scale farms in Lithuania have weak market integration, with no bargaining power on input and output markets. The vast majority of small-scale farms are reluctant to participate in cooperative activities in Lithuania. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the profile of a small farm that tends to cooperate.

Whilst most analyses have effectively treated credit unions as unsocial, uncontested spaces of purely economic considerations, this paper enters into the interrelational, and social space of the credit union study group. In so doing, it illustrates two interesting paradoxes at the heart of credit union operations. Firstly, it suggests a number of potential exclusionary effects recent deregulatory legislation has on the demarcation of common bond boundaries. Secondly, it illustrates how common bond boundary construction initiates a purification of financial space, but argues that the act of boundary formation itself is ultimately exclusionary in nature. Awareness of such issues on the part of the credit union development community of Kingston Upon Hull is-highlighted through recent changes in the city's overall credit union development strategy.

This paper builds an evaluation model of rural development pressure and left-behind to analyze the spatial differences and characteristics of rural development pressure and the three-stay problem in Jinchang City, Hexi Corridor, China, in 2019. Then, we explored the relationship between them. The conclusions are: (1) Jinchang City has the lowest pressure on infrastructure and the largest pressure on industrial development, with significant spatial differences in comprehensive pressure. (2) Jinchang City is dominated by double pressure villages (40.60%) and comprehensive pressure villages (38.35%). Single-pressure villages (19.55%) and non-pressure villages (1.50%) account for relatively small proportions. (3) The population of three-stay in Jinchang City is 1,642, accounting for 1.19% of the total rural population. The middle and low-level left-behind areas have the largest number, accounting for 76.69% of the total administrative villages. The types of left-behind villages are mainly dominated by left-behind children and left-behind elderly people, accounting for 71.72% of the total number of left-behind villages. (4) Homestead per household, the rate of network coverage, per capita cultivated land area, and the number of specialized farmer cooperatives owned are the main factors affecting different types of left-behind villages, and each factor has different effects on different types of left-behind villages.

The study shows how poor financial efficiency in credit unions may result from undesirable configurations in executive management and other variables related to governance. Design/methodology/approach - The study develops an innovative methodology to classify credit unions according to the level of governance using indicators of representativeness and participation, leadership, management and supervision. This methodology integrates the use of multiple correspondence and cluster analysis. The study then applies stochastic frontier models to analyze how governance affects the indicators of financial efficiency. Findings - The results highlight that better governance substantially increases the efficiency of credit unions in terms of a higher level of credit operations per institution. Originality/value - The paper uses a pioneering survey applied by the Central Bank to almost the total population of credit unions in Brazil. The results highlight how to operationalize a subjective and broad concept related to cooperative governance to identify the remarkable impacts of good governance practices on the financial efficiency of credit unions.","[Favalli, Ricardo Terranova] Banco Cent Brasil, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Maia, Alexandre Gori; Ferreira Jardim da Silveira, Jose Maria] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Campinas, Brazil",Central Bank of Brazil; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Maia, AG (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Campinas, Brazil.",gori@unicamp.br,"Maia, Alexandre Gori/Q-5222-2019","Maia, Alexandre Gori/0000-0003-0075-5094; Jardim da Silveira, Jose Maria/0000-0003-3680-875X",,,,,33,3,5,1,12,"UNIV SAO PAULO, FAC ECONOMIA",SAO PAULO SP,"TECSI LAB TECNOLOGIA E SISTEMAS INFORMACAO, AV PROF LUCIANO GUALBERTO., 908 FEA 3, SALA F184, SAO PAULO SP, 05508-900, BRAZIL",2531-0488,,,RAUSP MANAG J,RAUSP Manag.

We nest a cross-sectional time-series panel model within the risk-adjusted earnings principles of Ohlson (1995), and apply the model to a dataset of NSW credit unions during a period of regulatory intervention that abruptly required management to meet minimum capital thresholds. Because they, cannot issue equity, and other income increasing options conflicted with credit union philosophy, this provided a strong incentive to use MCE as an option to rapidly increase revenue (and capital). We find MCE was financially ineffective in small credit unions, had a positive marketing leverage impact in large credit unions, and required regular renewal. Our study makes several contributions by: (i) disaggregating and testing the financial impact of marketing; (ii) applying a risk-adjusted model generally applicable to non-listed firms; (iii) informing on the capitalisation/expensing debate; (iv) highlighting when and why MCE as a real option is financially (in)effective: and, (v) adding to the growing interface in the financial/marketing literature.","[Hodgson, Victoria L.] Clever Stuff, Rushcutters Bay, NSW 2011, Australia; [Hodgson, Allan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Hodgson, VL (corresponding author), Clever Stuff, Rushcutters Bay, NSW 2011, Australia.",victoria@thecleverstuff.com.au; A.C.Hodgson@uva.nl,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014","Hodgson, Allan/0000-0002-2670-4060",,,,,48,3,3,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0312-8962,1327-2020,,AUST J MANAGE,Aust.

Welfare-friendly claims hold considerable ambiguity in meaning since there is no precise definition of what better 'animal welfare' means in practice. However, despite this ambiguity there are numbers of animals that are being made into food products which carry labelling that suggests higher animal welfare, and in addition many animals or parts of animals which experience the same living standards but which don't ever get labelled to suggest welfare-friendliness. Through the development of an 'economy of qualities' (Callon et al. 2002) within the food market there have been a number of private initiatives by major retailers, farmers' cooperatives, independent standard bodies, manufacturing brands within the UK which has supported the development of a market for 'welfare-friendly' food products. How do these organisations work together to realise the economic potential through product labelling or corporate branding of meat/dairy or egg products from welfare-friendly production practices? Or in other words, by what mechanisms do some bodies or bodyproducts of animals attain, retain or lose power as welfare-friendly as they move through the different organised spaces of the supply chain?","Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch City & Reg Planning, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,,,"Roe, Emma/D-3617-2009; Bergeaud-Blackler, Florence/K-5365-2016; Sandøe, Peter/E-8758-2015; Higgin, Marc/ABD-5023-2021","Roe, Emma/0000-0003-4674-2133; Bergeaud-Blackler, Florence/0000-0001-7030-0605; Sandøe, Peter/0000-0003-0397-3273; Higgin, Marc/0000-0003-3316-7539",,,,,13,0,0,0,5,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,90-8686-008-7,,,,2006,,,,,,,80,84,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Ethics; Food Science & Technology; Social Issues",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Food Science & Technology; Social Issues,BEX88,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000240055000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/Methodology/Approach: Case studies were conducted in four representative Costa Rican cooperatives interviewing twenty interviewed cooperative administrators and members to determine changes in advisory services and farming practices over the past twenty years and factors which influenced those changes. Findings: Certifications induce cooperatives to offer new services to support farmers. Cooperatives form collaborations with new stakeholders or reconfigure existing collaborations to provide advisory services to their members. These services have helped to shape farmers' attitudes about sustainable farming practices, though farm-level changes may be small. The main change at the cooperative level is adding new topics for group training, and certification issues are directly linked with practices such as maintaining a farm record book or wearing a mask when applying pesticides. Practices which compete with productivity are unlikely to change. Practical Implications: The results are useful to improve the advisory services provided by cooperatives by better identifying the key issues to be addressed to fulfill the certifications' requirements. Theoretical implications: Cooperatives are a relevant player to induce more sustainable practices, by providing or coordinating advisory services, but their efforts cannot be seen disconnected from a broader institutional environment. Originality/Value: We demonstrate that certifications change the intensity and scope of advisory services and induce cooperatives to engage with a more diverse network of stakeholders.","[Snider, Anna; Sibelet, Nicole; Faure, Guy] CIRAD, UMR Innovat, 73 Ave Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Kraus, Eva; Bosselmann, Aske Skovmand] Univ Copenhagen, Prod Markets & Policy, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sibelet, Nicole] CATIE, IDEA, Turrialba, Costa Rica",CIRAD; University of Copenhagen; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza,"Snider, A (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR Innovat, 73 Ave Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",alsnider@yahoo.com,"Bosselmann, Aske Skovmand S/D-8965-2015","Bosselmann, Aske Skovmand S/0000-0001-7764-5630; Sibelet, Nicole/0000-0002-2107-6376","Joint Doctorate Program - EACEA (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency) of the European Commission [2001-0019]","Joint Doctorate Program - EACEA (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency) of the European Commission","This work was supported by the Joint Doctorate Program, funded by the EACEA (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency) of the European Commission under Grant AGTRAIN agreement number 2001-0019.",,44,11,11,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1389-224X,1750-8622,,J AGRIC EDUC EXT,J.

Information on laws regulating financial cooperatives, the supervisory approaches adopted, and deposit insurance schemes in sixty-five developing countries were collected-mostly-from original legislations for the period 1995-2014. Key findings suggest that indicators of financial cooperative development are positively correlated with the existence of a specialized regulation; supervision under non-bank financial supervisory authorities; and the presence of deposit insurance schemes, while general cooperative society's regulations and banking regulations are negatively correlated with financial cooperatives' indicators. These results are robust after controlling for economic and institutional factors as well as potential endogeneity bias.","[Khafagy, Amr] Ruhr Univ, Inst Dev Res & Dev Policy, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Khafagy, A (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ, Inst Dev Res & Dev Policy, Bochum, Germany.",amfkhafagy@gmail.com,,"Khafagy, Amr/0000-0001-8976-6405",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"I am very grateful to Professor Volker Nienhaus, Raffael Bair, Mohamed El-Shewy, the anonymous referee and the editor for their constructive comments, and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for the financial support.",,49,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1614-2446,1614-2454,,ANN FINANC,Ann.

Similarly, many food justice activists and organizations produce an analysis of oppressive forms of food power, while placing the goals of the movement to create sustainable community-based interventions in the periphery. Yet, the pursuit of food justice is a dual process related to power. This process is characterized by the simultaneous acts of dismantling oppressive forms of food power and building emancipatory forms of food power. It also has deep roots in the historical arc of food politics in the Black Freedom Struggle of the civil rights era. However, we know very little about this dual process and how black communities engage in it. In this paper, I juxtapose two cases of black farm projects-the historical case of Freedom Farms Cooperative (FFC) in Mississippi and the contemporary case of the Rocky Acres Community Farm (RACF) in New York-to explore the dual process of food justice. I conclude with a brief discussion on what the cases teach us about this dual process and its implications for scholars and activists who work on issues of food justice. Such implications provide insights into the possibilities of the food justice movement in the future and challenge the movement to include, more explicitly, issues of race, land, self-determination, and economic autonomy.","[Smith, Bobby J., II] Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign;, Dept African Amer Studies, 1201 West Nevada St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Smith, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign;, Dept African Amer Studies, 1201 West Nevada St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",bobbyjs2@illinois.edu,,"Smith II, Bobby/0000-0002-1083-9403","Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute, Mississippi Department of Archives and History; W.K.

We focus on a system centered on three reservoirs that capture the waters of the Upper Comoe River Basin and servicing a diversity of users, including a sugar manufacturing company, a urban water supply utility, a farmer cooperative, and other downstream users. Due to variable and declining rainfall and expanding users' needs, drastic fluctuations in water supply and demand occur during each dry season. A decision support tool was developed through participatory research to enable users to assess the impact of alternative release and diversion schedules on deficits faced by each user. The tool is meant to be applied in the context of consultative planning by a local user committee that has been created by a new national integrated water management policy. We contend that both solid science and good governance are instrumental in realizing efficient and equitable water management and adaptation to climate variability and change. But, while modeling tools and negotiation platforms may assist users in managing climate risk, they also introduce additional uncertainties into the deliberative process. It is therefore imperative to understand how these technological and institutional innovations frame water use issues and decisions to ensure that such framing is consistent with the goals of integrated water resource management.","[Roncoli, Carla; Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Georgia, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Griffin, GA 30223 USA; [Kirshen, Paul] Battelle Mem Inst, Lexington, MA 02421 USA; [Etkin, Derek] Camp Dresser McKee, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sanon, Moussa; Some, Leopold; Dembele, Youssouf] Inst Environm & Rech Agr 01, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Sanfo, Bienvenue J.] Direct Meteorol, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Zoungrana, Jacqueline] Direct Gen Ressources Eau, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Battelle Memorial Institute,"Roncoli, C (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 1107 Expt St, Griffin, GA 30223 USA.",croncoli@uga.edu,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Sectoral Applications Research,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Sectoral Applications Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors acknowledge helpful input by Kate Dunbar, Carrie Furman, Richard Marcus, Don Nelson, Joel Paz, Ben Orlove, Michael Paolisso, and Renzo Taddei; and also the constructive comments of three anonymous reviewers.

In this research, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 on Iran's livestock and meat market by using an equilibrium displacement model. The prevalence of the Coronavirus has had the greatest economic effects on rising exchange rates and has reduced exports in Iran. The results also show that the factors of the Coronavirus (exchange rate and exports) have the highest effect on Iran's meat market. The rising exchange rates and reduced exports lead to higher prices and lower quantities in the meat market, which increase the suppliers' welfare at the retail and farm levels. These results show the negative effect of the outbreak of Coronavirus. Corona outbreak increases price at the farm and retail level, therefore, farm and retail quantities fall. Since the impact of an increase in the price is much greater than the effect of reducing production, producer surplus increases. A policy conclusion of this research is that the current situation in Iran is difficult for the poultry and livestock industry because of the need for foreign currency and the abuse of market power in the distribution system. Farmer cooperatives can overcome these problems because their objectives are to serve farmers and their goals align with farmers goals.","[Ronaghi, M.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Agr, Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48005 USA",Michigan State University,"Ronaghi, M (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Agr, Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48005 USA.",marzi_ronaghi@yahoo.com,,,,,,,40,2,2,4,6,TARBIAT MODARES UNIV,TEHRAN,"JALAL-ALE-AHMAD AVE, PO BOX 14115-336, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",1680-7073,2345-3737,,J AGR SCI TECH-IRAN,J.

This paper studies the initial organisation and subsequent transformation of the socio-technical assemblage or 'agencement' around wind power in Denmark, focusing on the changing roles and agency of electricity producers. We propose a conceptual model for mapping the transformation over time, following five entangled dimensions: capitalisation instruments, turbine technology, capital investment, regulation of finance and ownership modes. We show how changes in all five socio-material dimensions have produced a 'paradigm shift', reconfiguring wind power from a distributed power source to critical infrastructure. This shift has marginalised local players and mobilised new types of producers and ownership forms. Using the conceptual model, we map the controversy resulting from the paradigm shift. Our relational lens of market studies within Science & Technology Studies captures how wind power's 'sustainability' has become contested, and how this cannot be understood as a matter of 'community acceptance' dissociated from material factors. Proposing our conceptual model for future studies, we contribute not only to the extant social acceptance literature, but also to critical energy debates on the governance of climate change and sustainability.","[Kirch Kirkegaard, Julia; Cronin, Tom] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Lyngby, Denmark; [Nyborg, Sophie] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Lyngby, Denmark; [Karnoe, Peter] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, DIST Ctr Design Innovat & Sustainable Transit, Copenhagen, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Technical University of Denmark; Aalborg University,"Kirkegaard, JK (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Lyngby, Denmark.",jukk@dtu.dk,"Cronin, Tom/ABF-4526-2020; Kirkegaard, Julia Kirch/ABF-4609-2020; Kirkegaard, Julia Kirch/K-3647-2017; Nyborg, Sophie/AAX-5163-2021","Cronin, Tom/0000-0001-7386-7973; Kirkegaard, Julia Kirch/0000-0001-9340-7202; Nyborg, Sophie/0000-0001-8182-9280",Danish Council for Strategic Research [1305-00021B],Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),This work was supported by The Danish Council for Strategic Research: [Grant Number 1305-00021B].,,58,18,18,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

Design/methodology/approach - The method adopted was the Classic Linear Regression Model with Panel Data, estimated by Feasible Generalized Least Squares for fixed effects and corrections for heteroscedasticity. The sample was made up of 113 credit unions affiliated to UNICRED systems, over the 2001-2011 period, and data was made available by Central Bank of Brazil. Findings - The analysis, carried out through non-discretionary results on credit operations in order to explain the changes in net expenses of provision on credit operations, indicated there was smoothing of results. Thus, we can infer that the credit unions affiliated to UNICRED make use of earnings management in the income smoothing modality. Originality/value -This study contributes to the issue of Accounting Results Management, and corroborates that there are indications that, in the occurrence of higher non-discretionary results, credit unions tend to maximize provisions. Similarly, in the occurrence of lower non-discretionary results, they tend to minimize provisions, making evident the search for smaller variability in results, thus signaling mitigation of risks.","[Fully Bressan, Valeria Gama; de Souza, Douglas Coelho] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Econ Sci, Accouting Sci Dept, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Bressan, Aureliano Angel] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Management Sci, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Bressan, VGF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Econ Sci, Accouting Sci Dept, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",vfully@face.ufmg.br; douglascoelho.s@hotmail.com; bressan@face.ufmg.br,"Fully, Valeria/D-8146-2018; Bressan, Aureliano A/H-4799-2012; Bressan, Aureliano Angel/V-2757-2019","Fully, Valeria/0000-0001-6340-9717; Bressan, Aureliano A/0000-0002-9333-3394; Bressan, Aureliano Angel/0000-0002-9333-3394",FAPEMIG - Foundation for Research Support of the State of Minas Gerais [CSA - APQ-02074-14],FAPEMIG - Foundation for Research Support of the State of Minas Gerais,FAPEMIG - Foundation for Research Support of the State of Minas Gerais (Project n.: CSA - APQ-02074-14) PROBIC/FAPEMIG - Scientific initiation research grant.,,40,3,3,0,10,FUND ESCOLA COMERCIO ALVARES PENTEADO-FECAP,SAO PAULO SP,"AV DA LIBERDADE 532, SAO PAULO SP, CEP01502-001, BRAZIL",1806-4892,,,RBGN-REV BRAS GEST N,RBGN-Rev.

The authors assess the conditions under which IST could improve the well-being of the associated farmers and, at the same time, improve financial sustainability. Financial aspects are of particular relevance since the characteristics of the cooperative cause the management of the tool to become potentially risky. Design/methodology/approach The analysis relies on a balanced panel dataset to report the production and economic characteristics of individual associated farms. This is the basis for simulating the implementation of the IST as described in the current European regulation. The expected utility approach is then used to assess the potential impact on farmers' well-being under different levels of risk aversion and premiums. The analysis of the IST annual cash flow allows for an accurate assessment of its financial sustainability. Findings The results suggest that the IST can improve farmers' well-being under plausible levels of risk aversion and premiums, making most farmers willing to support its implementation. Furthermore, the tool could be financially sustainable even if implemented in a specialized and geographically concentrated group of farms. In addition, the results suggest that the use of strategies such as the IST could help cope with negative annual balances by treating the financial sustainability of the fund. Originality/value The analysis adds to previous research on the IST by accounting for farmers' risk aversion. Furthermore, it is the first analysis that simulates the implementation of this tool in a sector-specific and concentrated group of farms. The results provide useful evidence for those subjects planning to implement the IST in small and specialized farming systems.","[Zinnanti, Cinzia; Coletta, Attilio; Torrigiani, Michele; Severini, Simone] Univ Tuscia, DAFNE, Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Zinnanti, C (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, DAFNE, Viterbo, Italy.",cinzia.zinnanti@unitus.it,"; SEVERINI, Simone/A-6944-2017","Torrigiani, Michele/0000-0003-3190-0725; COLETTA, Attilio/0000-0001-9802-274X; SEVERINI, Simone/0000-0001-5501-3552",,,,,91,0,0,2,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

However, many self-governance initiatives proceed with difficulty, particularly when these initiatives conflict with established rules and institutions. This paper addresses the question of the extent to which, and under what conditions, self-governance initiatives can become successful in heavily regulated policy fields. It, therefore, analyses a self-governance initiative by a Dutch farmers' association from two theoretical perspectives: Ostrom's institutional design principles and insights from the politics of self-governance. Whereas, Ostrom's principles focus on arranging interactions between the members of a self-governing community and their common resources, the focus of the politics literature is on the negotiations between the community and the governmental authorities to obtain room for self-governance. The paper reveals how the arrangements within the association influenced the negotiation between this community and the involved authorities, and vice versa. This mutual relationship can both positively and negatively influence the accomplishment of self-governance. Adequate self-governance arrangements can help to convince policy-makers to provide room in existing policies to accommodate self-governance. Conversely, policy-makers can help to set conditions for designing successful arrangements. Otherwise, both processes can negatively reinforce each other, and this can result in stalemates and blockades.","[Termeer, Catrien J. A.

Our results raise several debatable issues regarding the ethics of accounting management and the imposition of one-shoe-fits-all external regulation.","[Hillier, David] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9PR, W Yorkshire, England; [Hodgson, Allan; Lhaopadchan, Suntharee] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Stevenson-Clarke, Peta] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Lhaopadchan, Suntharee] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Management Sci, Chon Buri, Thailand",University of Leeds; University of Amsterdam; Griffith University; Kasetsart University,"Hillier, D (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9PR, W Yorkshire, England.",d.j.hillier@leeds.ac.uk; A.C.Hodgson@uva.nl; Peta.Stevenson@griffith.edu.au; s.lhaopadchan@uva.nl,,"Lhaopadchan, Suntharee/0000-0002-5060-094X; Stevenson-Clarke, Peta/0000-0003-3135-4592; Hodgson, Allan/0000-0002-2670-4060",,,,,38,16,16,3,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

A dry season decline in milk production of over 40% due to feed scarcity is a common phenomenon. Adoption of improved feed production, conservation and utilization technologies and practices in dairy farming communities is poor. This review work was based on a key question which states Why is adoption of improved dairy nutrition technologies and practices in Tanzania still poor despite being promoted for decades?. We have shown that major opportunities for curbing dry season animal feed shortage include on-farm optimization of production and use of high yielding pasture varieties including napier grass (Pennisetum purperium Schumach.) and leguminous fodder species. Crop residues in particular maize stover needs to be optimized for effective dry season feeding. The major reasons for low adoption of proven technologies include limited technical knowhow among smallholder dairy farmers augmented by limited extension services and technological costs. For enhancing sustainable uptake; we suggest promotion of on-farm research, public-private partnerships and dairy farmers' cooperative associations. These are vital for facilitating smooth access to information, investment capital, reliable inputs and markets among the smallholder dairy farmers.","[Maleko, David] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Sustainable Agr Biodivers & Ecosyst Manageme, Arusha, Tanzania; [Maleko, David; Msalya, George] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Anim Aquaculture & Range Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Mwilawa, Angello] Tanzania Livestock Res Inst, Mabuki Res Ctr, Mwanza, Tanzania; [Pasape, Liliane] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm & Management, Arusha, Tanzania; [Mtei, Kelvin] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Water Resources, Environm Sci & Engn, Arusha, Tanzania",Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology; Sokoine University of Agriculture; Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology; Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology,"Maleko, D (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Sustainable Agr Biodivers & Ecosyst Manageme, Arusha, Tanzania.;Maleko, D (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Anim Aquaculture & Range Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania.",maleko@suanet.ac.tz,"Pasape, Liliane/GNH-6323-2022","Pasape, Liliane/0000-0002-8898-9874; Maleko, David/0000-0002-5237-8510",Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) [RU 2015 CARP 06],Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM),The authors are grateful for a capacity building competitive grant number (RU 2015 CARP 06) provided by the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) for funding this study.,,71,18,18,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

Yet Cooxupe leaders face increasing challenges ahead. The world coffee industry has evolved in such a way that growth is deemed essential for survival. The growth imperative poses additional challenges to Cooxupe. First, it becomes more difficult to originate coffees with the quality consistency expected by clients. Second, the increased size and heterogeneity of the membership may have negative impacts on cohesion.

However, like banks and savings banks, they have to be as efficient and competitive as possible to survive in today's business environment, especially at times of crisis. To date, there have been very few studies on their efficiency and practically none for the crisis period. Moreover, almost all the existing studies assess only financial efficiency, without considering their social function. This study examines the levels of both financial and social efficiency in Spanish credit unions as well as their main determinants during the recent crisis. We apply the two-stage double bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology based on panel data corresponding to all the credit unions active in Spain between 2008 and 2013. The empirical results indicate that financial and social efficiency achieved an acceptable level, although on average the former was slightly greater than the latter. We also find that both age and merger and acquisition activity were positively influential on the financial efficiency of credit unions but had a significant negative effect on their social efficiency. Moreover, the regional location of such entities and the financial crisis were also crucial determinants of both types of efficiency. Our findings are therefore useful for all the stakeholders of credit unions to know if these entities have been efficient according to a double bottom line accounting in the crisis period and hence to maintain successful social management that is compatible with satisfactory financial efficiency.","[Martinez-Campillo, Almudena; Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda; del Pilar Sierra-Fernandez, Maria] Univ Leon, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Martínez-Campillo, A (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",amarc@unileon.es,"Fernández-Santos, Yolanda/L-8070-2016; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/G-8575-2015","Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/0000-0002-3313-529X; Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda/0000-0003-1392-3130; Sierra-Fernandez, Pilar/0000-0001-5598-8819",,,,,63,8,9,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

This has given rise to a series of social, economic, and ecological crises in the food chain. Some farmers are responding to this by adjusting their land-use and farming practices so as to make their farms more sustainable. But such changes need to be aligned with the specificities of the local bio-physical environment and the logic of the political economic environment. This article highlights how cooperative approaches allow public and private regulatory systems to support ecological transitions. Through a theoretical lens on place-based and restorative farming practices it analyses and interprets three complementary cooperative approaches as possible starting points for the transition towards a more sustainable agri-food system. The case studies show how farmers cooperatives can be either linked to the environment and to public policies (and thus extrinsic product quality), or to the market (and intrinsic product quality), or a combination of both. These links provide competitive advantages to farmers, and enable them to increase income from farming. We then discuss the effectiveness of these forms of self-governance, and how cooperative approaches, if well organised and implemented and appropriately embedded, can empower farmers to further change and adapt their farming practices so as to restore and improve their endogenous resource base. The analysis shows that while they are place-specific they are far from locally/regionally-bounded and that their success (or failure) critically depends on their alignment with national, supra-national and global actants.","[Swagemakers, Paul; Dominguez Garcia, M.

Using a multi-stage sampling procedure, 384 growers were selected at random to participate in the survey. A structured household survey was the main tool for data collection. Descriptive statistical methods and the double-hurdle model were employed in the analysis. Our study finds that the probability of a household being participating in the apple value chain increases with household head education level, experience, extension contacts, and membership in local cooperatives, while decreases with household size and incidence of disease and insect pests. Results further showed that mango plot size and membership in local cooperatives increase the probability of participation decisions in the mango value chain. Moreover, households' intensity of participation in the apple value chain increases with education level and extension contacts, whereas age squared and distance to the nearest market decrease their intensity of participation in the mango value chain. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at improving rural infrastructure (roads and markets), price information systems, human capital, and promotion of farmers' cooperatives, as well as access to disease and insect pest control mechanisms, could improve the participation of farmers in the fruits value chain.","[Mossie, Mengistie; Gerezgiher, Alemseged] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Ayalew, Zemen; Nigussie, Zerihun] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, POB 79, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Nigussie, Zerihun] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, 1390 Hamasaka, Tottori 6800001, Japan",Addis Ababa University; Bahir Dar University; Tottori University,"Mossie, M (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Rural Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",mengistiemossie@gmail.com; abushalex2@gmail.com; zayalew@gmail.co; zeriye@gmail.com,"Nigussie, Zerihun/AAV-9190-2020","Nigussie, Zerihun/0000-0002-8001-2073; Mossie, Mengistie/0000-0003-3082-4732",Addis Ababa University; Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) [JPMJSA1601],Addis Ababa University; Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS),"This study was supported by a research grant from Addis Ababa University and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS), Grant Number JPMJSA1601.",,81,4,4,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,NOV 2,2020,6,1,,,,,,,1842132,10.1080/23311932.2020.1842132,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2020.1842132,,,23,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,OP5IQ,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000588118700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results confirm the previously observed role of market structure and strongly point to a significant role for credit unions in disciplining the exercise of market power by banks.

Their rate of infection and production of mycotoxins is mainly influenced by weather and pre-harvest agronomic measures. Consequently, farmers' prevention and control of mycotoxins are imperative since it is difficult to remove mycotoxins further down the cereal supply chain. This study aimed to (i) identify which pre-harvest preventive and control measures Dutch wheat farmers currently apply against Fusarium spp. infection and mycotoxin contamination and to (ii) examine which farm and fanner characteristics explain the implementation of these measures. Field data on pre-harvest measures, like the selection of resistant varieties, fungicide use, and crop rotation, along with farm and farmer characteristics were collected from Dutch wheat farmers via an online questionnaire. Probit models were applied to examine farm and farmer characteristics that explain the implementation of pre-harvest measures. Results showed that most farmers applied six or more different measures against Fusarium spp. infection and mycotoxin contamination in wheat and that the use of pre-harvest measures is related to at least one other measure. However, results indicated that about 44% of farmers could become more effective if they implemented a benchmark approach consisting of a combination of fungicide use during flowering, selection of a Fusarium resistant wheat variety, and plowing or crop rotation. Five out of the ten evaluated farm and farmer characteristics significantly (p < 0.05) explained the implementation of at least one of the eight pre-harvest control measures. These five farm and farmer characteristics include wheat as main income crop, the use of a decision support system, the education level of the farmer, the farmer's knowledge about mycotoxins, and the farmer's level of risk aversion. Insight into relevant characteristics can be used by farmer cooperatives, processing industries and government agencies to improve the overall mycotoxin management of wheat farmers.","[Janssen, E.

In so doing, it declared its objective of concentrating its efforts on these areas, trying out a methodology for action, and proving to the European Union that it was taking action. The present study has documented the on-going situations and actions on these Grenelle catchment areas and identified the broad types of actions and situations as part of a critical analysis of the approach retained by the government. After constructing an analytical framework of these areas, we assembled together a large collection of data to be analyzed with multivariate statistical analysis. These data were either gathered from surveys based on a questionnaire encompassing biophysical, agricultural, social, and economic aspects or based on spatialized statistical data sources. This work demonstrates key factors characterizing the catchment areas: the hydrological entry point for the definition of a field of action involves great variability of territorial size and therefore of the players involved (municipalities, farmers, cooperatives, users). Little attention is given to this aspect in the relatively rigid single legal procedure presently in force. On these catchment areas, we emphasize two main lines of structuring parameters: on the one hand, the relative diversity of land use and forms of agriculture, and on the other, the relative strength of the administrative structure. These results could be useful for those managing these issues in the different government agencies, those implementing the approaches, or local authorities responsible for resource management, as they provide a better understanding of how to adapt these experiments to other areas concerned by water resource issues.

Agronomic management through the implementation of various pre-harvest measures can reduce the probability ofFusariumspp. infection in the wheat field. To design interventions that could stimulate wheat farmers to (further) improve their agronomic management to reduce FHB, it is key to understand farmers' behaviour towards adapting their management. The aim of this paper was to understand the intention, underlying behavioural constructs, and beliefs of Dutch wheat farmers to adapt their agronomic management to reduce FHB and mycotoxin contamination in wheat, applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Data were collected from 100 Dutch wheat farmers via a questionnaire. The standard TPB analysis was extended with an assessment of the robustness of the belief results to account for the statistical validity of the analysis on TPB beliefs (i.e. to address the so-called expectancy-value muddle). Forty-six percent of the farmers had a positive intention to change their management in the next 5 years. The two behavioural constructs significantly related to this intention were attitude and social norm, whereas association with the perceived behavioural control construct was insignificant indicating that farmers did not perceive any barriers to change their behaviour. Relevant attitudinal beliefs indicated specific attributes of wheat, namely yield, quality and safety (lower mycotoxin contamination). This indicates that strengthening these beliefs-by demonstrating that a change in management will result in a higher yield and quality and lower mycotoxin levels-will result in a stronger attitude and, subsequently, a higher intention to change management. Interventions to strengthen these beliefs should preferably go by the most important referents for social norms, which were the buyers and the farmer cooperatives in this study.","[Janssen, E.

The five-point Likert scale measurement was created and applied to measure the perception of respondents about the scheme on considered 26 attributes and analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results revealed that the overall perception of the respondent contract farm households about the scheme was unfavorable with a weighted mean/index score of '2.32' with a mixed perception index score on considered 26 attributes. The study discussed the policy implications of the findings. The main areas of concern are the payment system, the relationship of contract farmers with representatives (from the union, factory, and cooperatives), the income of contract farm households, the provision of services package (like free training, extension services, technical advice), the transparent and comprehensive contract terms and conditions, the provision of basic inputs and production services as per agreement (like adequate land preparation, infield irrigation), the effective and efficient legal framework system, additional support by third parties (on pre and post-harvest, production input provision, basic skill training, and etc.), and both parties should develop trust by having confidence on each other and not by acting opportunistically.","[Fedi, Gutema Bati; Asefa, Fekadu Dereje; Waktole, Abebe Tafa] Res Ctr Ethiopian Sugar Corp, Program Socioecon Res, Adama, Ethiopia",,"Fedi, GB (corresponding author), Res Ctr Ethiopian Sugar Corp, Program Socioecon Res, Adama, Ethiopia.",gutemabati@gmail.com,,"BATI FEDI, GUTEMA/0000-0001-6962-6149",Ethiopian Sugar Corporation Research and Development Center in Socioeconomics Research Program,Ethiopian Sugar Corporation Research and Development Center in Socioeconomics Research Program,The data collection for this study was supported by the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation Research and Development Center in Socioeconomics Research Program.,,17,0,0,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2332-2039,,,COGENT ECON FINANC,Cogent Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - The research adopts a multiple case study approach using mixed methods of data collection where case study companies are interviewed and complete a questionnaire. This process allows us to create a supply chain map and create a narrative which records the burdens and impacts occurring in local food supply chains and smaller producers looking beyond local markets. This evidence is then set against the theory of constraints (TOO) to provide a theoretical underpinning and to examine consistency of the findings. Findings - Seven broad categories of constraint type are observed: constraints due to the nature of the market; due to scale and the nature of products; constraints related to employment and skills; institutional constraints; constraints in supply chain relationships; certification, policy and regulatory constraints; and constraints around personal beliefs and anthropomorphism. Each is described as to its origin, its limitation to business and where possible, how it might be remedied. The constraints point to some counter-intuitive results as far as common perceptions of local food are concerned but suggestions for improvement are made through collaborative producer efforts, alternative institutional intervention, supply chain re-engineering and logistics innovation. Practical implications - Practical suggestions are made to improve the inclusiveness of distribution networks, to better utilise regional food groups (RFGs), to develop opportunities to set up autonomous supply chain centres, or to broaden the function of farmer co-operatives. The paper also provides an alternative model of the TOO specifically adapted for local food producers, the focus of which plays to their strengths and focuses on building competencies across, up and down the supply chain. Originality/value - The adaptation of the TOO provides an advancement of knowledge in the area of food supply chain analysis and is done in a way that is more practical in use. The paper also provides the opportunity to take a similar approach to examining other niche supply opportunities in the sector, which may be dependent on other geographically defined barriers, such as seasonal or ethnic products.","[Oglethorpe, David; Heron, Graeme] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK; Northumbria University,"Oglethorpe, D (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",doglethorpe@hotmail.com,,"Oglethorpe, David/0000-0002-6505-1197",,,,,81,29,30,2,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-3577,1758-6593,,INT J OPER PROD MAN,Int.

The US Farm Bill & agrarian (in)viability,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural policy analysis; US Farm Bill; Supply management; Food regimes; Agrarian viability; Polanyian double movement,FOOD REGIME; MARKETING BOARDS; POLICY; GOVERNANCE; SYSTEM; WTO,"Farm subsidies have become increasingly maligned in agricultural policy debates, but the merits of subsidies are a distraction from deeper political, economic, and ecological problems in agriculture. Drawing on a history of the U.S. Farm Bill, this paper argues that a fixation on farm subsidies ignores why they came into being, and more generally glosses over the imperative for modern states to intervene into agricultural economies. Karl Polanyi's 'double movement' framework is used to situate the rise and fall of agricultural supply management within food regime theory. In the second, or surplus food regime, the U.S. government wielded excess commodities as geopolitical tools even as domestic farm policy labored to contain overproduction, and thus support agrarian viability. In the subsequent corporate food regime, free market agriculture displaces and discredits supply management, even as massive government intervention into how food is grown and sold continues. Making space to remember historical price support programs, to situate their accomplishments and limitations, and to recognize residual supply -management mechanisms (such as farm cooperatives and agricultural marketing orders) is crucial for fostering agricultural viability in the US and beyond. Twentieth century supply management had flaws, but it cannot be wholly omitted. This paper highlights key motivations, elements, and contradictions of these policies and programs to begin the process of considering how supply management principles and strategies could be updated and enhanced for 21st century agriculture. Such a framework would need to pay more attention to diversity within domestic and international agricultures, and be more sensitive to the multi-scalar dimensions of food systems.

These concepts are important in informal governance systems such as mutuals because they economise on transaction costs and promote efficient exchange. In this respect, the paper argues that mutuals have a comparative advantage compared with joint stock banks in ameliorating problems associated with adverse selection and moral hazard. These comparative advantages, however, are enhanced in small mutuals such as credit unions which focus on relatively small memberships with a common bond. The paper concludes by suggesting that although the credit union movement will not necessarily develop along similar lines to the building societies, it does have a future in providing banking facilities to the relatively poor and disenfranchised sectors of society.","Loughborough Univ Technol, Banking Ctr, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Howcroft, B (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ Technol, Banking Ctr, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",,,"Amess, Kevin/0000-0002-2447-1988",,,,,34,8,8,0,9,BLACKWELL PUBL LTD,OXFORD,"108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD OX4 1JF, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-8410,,,CORP GOV,Corp.

In the middle of the dramatic restructuring and recapitalization process implemented by Spanish commercial banks, credit unions have strengthened their solvency and increased their market share during the crisis period. Despite this evidence, in general, credit unions have been considered less efficient than commercial banks because they have a dual nature: on the one hand, these companies are cooperatives so they are Social Economy enterprises, and, on the other hand, they are entities in the banking system. However, few studies have focused on empirically evaluating their efficiency, and even less in a crisis context. This study aims to estimate the financial efficiency in the banking activity of Spanish credit unions during the period 2008-2013 and to analyse their determinants. To achieve these objectives, an innovative two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is applied under the condition of national and sectorial homogeneity. Our results suggest that credit unions in Spain were quite inefficient in their banking activity during the crisis period, although they were able to improve the management of their inputs to obtain their financial outputs year after year. The findings also show that both the agglomeration in urban areas and the regional effect have influenced significantly on their financial efficiency.","[Sierra-Fernandez, Maria-Pilar; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena; Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda] Univ Leon, Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Sierra-Fernandez, MP (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Leon, Spain.",pilar.sierra@unileon.es; amarc@unileon.es; yfers@unileon.es,"Fernández-Santos, Yolanda/L-8070-2016; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/G-8575-2015","Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/0000-0002-3313-529X",,,,,30,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,114,124,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000540720300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast to banks that generate profit for outside investors and do not give voice to customers, these not-for-profit institutions have a democratic governance structure and a mission to provide good services to their members. We use diverse economies and critical/feminist geographic information system (GIS) approaches to theorize them as noncapitalist alternatives to banks and possible sites of social transformation toward a solidarity economy. Using the case of cooperative finance in New York City, we analyze spatial patterns, characteristics, and placemaking practices of credit unions with different kinds of the common bond, a principle that unites a financial community, and in relation to urban geographies of class and race. We find that credit unions provide a historically proven mechanism for collective resistance to marginalization by racial capitalism and, depending on the common bond type, make place by (1) providing financial inclusion in poor and minority neighborhoods; (2) scaling up solidarity finance through participation of middle classes; and (3) diverting assets from capitalist investment into social reproduction and livelihoods. Credit unions express the racialized wealth of their communities, however, and create spatial exclusions that pose a challenge to postcapitalist movements such as solidarity economy. These findings are applicable to other places marked by segregation and call for further inquiry into possibilities and barriers to solidarity finance.

We conduct an experiment to empirically investigate producer incentives to free-ride on quality among the members of a marketing cooperative in a setting where the average quality provided by cooperative members results in a collective rent that is distributed back to members in a patronage dividend levied in proportion to the quantity produced. Hidden actions by cooperative members that impact quality are imperfectly monitored, but free-riding, when detected, results in exclusion from cooperative returns. The randomized payoff structure of our game results in a novel experimental design that nests public good games and multi-player assurance games. Our findings indicate that free-riding on product quality is deterred when (a) cooperatives base patronage dividends on quality outcomes of smaller groups; (b) payoffs from free-riding are randomized by the possibility of exclusion from cooperative returns; and (c) cooperatives distribute a larger share of returns to members through indirect payments such as capital pooling and cost-sharing arrangements unrelated to product quality.","[Bonroy, Olivier] INRA French Natl Inst Agr Res, Paris, France; [Bonroy, Olivier; Garapin, Alexis] Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL, Grenoble, France; [Hamilton, Stephen F.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Monteiro, Diogo M.

It is argued that the credit union industry faces an inherent demutualisation bias which emerges as the sec tor develops maturity. Contributing factors include the emergence of professional management pursuing personal objectives, together with the economic realities of technological change, financial liberalisation, increased competition, and prudential regulation based on minimum capital requirements. Demutualisation incentives may partially reflect the unsuitability of the mutual form of governance in larger, more sophisticated financial institutions, but there is also a significant risk of demutualisation based on wealth expropriation motives. Alternative policies and strategies which might avoid this demutualisation bias are examined.","[Davis, Kevin] Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Commonwealth Bank, Grp Chair Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Davis, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Commonwealth Bank, Grp Chair Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",kevin.davis@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,42,9,9,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0307-4358,1758-7743,,MANAG FINANC,Manag.

Collective action has been promoted to remedy those disadvantages. Using survey data of 421 women members and 210 nonmembers of a coffee producer cooperative in Western Uganda, this study investigates the determinants of women's participation in cooperatives and women's intensity of participation. The results highlight the importance of access to and control over land for women to join the cooperative in the first place. Participation intensity is measured through women's participation in collective coffee marketing and share capital contributions. It is found that duration of membership, access to extension services, more equal intrahousehold power relations, and joint land ownership positively influence women's ability to commit to collective action. These findings demonstrate the embeddedness of collective action in gender relations and the positive value of women's active participation for agricultural-marketing cooperatives.","[Selhausen, Felix Meier Zu] Univ Utrecht, Hist & Art Hist, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Selhausen, FMZ (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Econ, Jubilee Bldg 229, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",fm272@sussex.ac.uk,,"Meier zu Selhausen, Felix/0000-0001-8593-7983",,,,,63,46,46,1,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

It analyzes the factors that contribute to an accelerated failure time (AFT) using information from customers' credit applications as well as information provided in their credit report. Design/methodology/approach - This paper investigates the factors that affect credit risk using survival analysis by employing two primary models - the AFT model and the Cox proportional hazard (PH) model. While several studies employ the Cox PH model, few use the AFT model. However, this paper concludes that the AFT model has superior predictive qualities. Findings - This paper finds that the factors specific to borrowers and local factors play an important role in the duration of a loan. Practical implications - This paper offers an easily interpretable model for determining the duration of a potential borrower. The marketing department of credit unions can then use this information to predict when a customer will default, thus allowing the credit union to intervene in a timely manner to prevent defaults. Further, the credit union can use this information to seek out customers who are less likely to default. Originality/value - This study is different from the previous research due to its focus on credit unions, which have distinct characteristics. Compared to similar lending institutions, the charter of the credit union does not allow management to sell off loans to other investors.","[Hassan, M.

We analyzed the effects of local livelihoods, cooperative types, and selected biophysical variables (elevation, slope, percent shade, distance to the forest, coffee density, and coffee age) on tree biodiversity in shade coffee cooperatives of El Salvador. Tree inventories from 51 quadrats in coffee cooperatives included 2743 individuals from 46 families and 123 identified tree species. Species richness and tree diameters differed among some cooperatives, with greater richness associated with greater stein density; other biophysical variables had little impact on diversity. The amount of shade in the coffee plantations differed among cooperatives, particularly in the wet season. Of the tree species reported in a recent study of a neighboring forest and in the cooperatives (N = 227 species combined), 16% were present at both sites. The three coffee plantations shared 35% of total species reported from all cooperatives. Our research shows that the number of tree species found in a coffee plantation increases with the density of shade trees included in the system. In turn, agroecological management, as influenced by farmer livelihood strategies and cooperative types, directly affects shade canopy composition. Important factors to take into account are the types of farmer organizations present, the cost of maintaining species of conservation concern, and the potential benefits that conservation could bring to the livelihood strategies of farm households.

We argue that channel diversity is positively associated with a firm's profitability and negatively associated with its profit volatility, and that channel diversity and product diversity are complementary in driving these profit-enhancing and volatility-suppressing effects. We test our hypotheses in the U.S. credit union industry, in which credit unions offer a variety of loan and deposit products through a variety of online and offline channels, including physical branches, ATMs, telephone banking, online banking, and mobile banking. By analyzing a longitudinal dataset of 7577 credit unions in 2009-2016, the study provides empirical evidence that operating a full spectrum of online and offline channels leads to higher profitability and lower profit volatility for credit unions. The study also reveals differential moderating effects of loan product diversity and deposit product diversity, in that loan product diversity enhances the profit-enhancing effect of channel diversity while deposit product diversity enhances the volatility-suppressing effect of channel diversity. This paper contributes to the studies of channel-based strategic differentiation as a competitive strategy and the studies of firms' risk-return performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we introduce REALISTIC, a novel event-based modeling framework for supply chain networks (SCNs) that includes production processes. It extends McCarty's Resources-Events-Agents (REA) accounting model with secure transformations, which, across the entire SCN, guarantee that certified output resources cannot be digitally produced ex nihilo, but require certified input resources of at least the same amount as what is produced. This generalizes the no-double-spend guarantee of current BC/DLT to (digital twins of) physical resources and their production. Authenticated human or robotic Internet of Things (IoT) actors digitally sign and cryptographically commit to the veracity of real-world events on an immutable database, without having to take responsibility for their aggregate consequences. User-specifiable interpretations, corresponding to queries and analytical functions in database systems, provide auditable aggregate information computed from recorded events across the entire SCN. This includes fine-grained and trustworthy tracing of final products through multiple stages of production processes, semi-finished products, quality certifications and transportation all the way back to their raw materials. We present a case study for an end-to-end coffee supply chain that tracks fine-grained and detailed information from a farmer's coffee cherries to retail coffee bags, involving all its actors. Our model handles product provenance; auditable sustainability, quality and trade information; production processes from parchment via green to roasted coffee; product quality tests; farmer certifications; and transportation across the entire coffee supply chain. It is based on field work involving farmers, cooperatives, processors, traders, importers, and a major roasting company stretching from Colombia to Scandinavia. Its REALISTIC-based modeling is the foundation for the design of our prototype implementation, which includes Ethereum blockchain code, RDBMS-based server code and a web app client.

Commercial banks claim that credit unions are no different than banks and that the credit union tax exemption represents an unfair competitive advantage. Credit unions counter that while they offer similar products and services, they differ from commercial banks in terms of structure and mission, given their not-for-profit, cooperative status. In this paper, we test for substantive differences in the objective functions of commercial banks and nonprofit credit unions by comparing CEO compensation structures. Drawing on the relevant principal-agent literature, we provide several arguments to support the hypotheses that credit union boards of directors establish lower-powered incentive contracts with their CEOs relative to similarly sized commercial banks, and offer lower total compensation. We find that credit union CEOs receive approximately 250% less performance-based compensation relative to CEOs of similarly sized community banks. Bank CEOs also earn approximately 15% to 20% more total compensation on average. The results are generally robust to controlling for CEO- and board-level characteristics, local economic conditions, and institution-level indicators of size, growth, complexity, liquidity and risk. The findings suggest important differences in incentive structures and objectives between banks and credit unions.","[van Rijn, Jordan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zeng, Shuwei] Freddie Mac, Mclean, VA USA; [Hueth, Brent] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Freddie Mac; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"van Rijn, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",vanrijn@vvisc.edu,,"van Rijn, Jordan/0000-0001-5189-281X",,,,,120,3,3,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

J,"Wynne-Jones, S",,,,"Wynne-Jones, Sophie",,,Understanding farmer co-operation: Exploring practices of social relatedness and emergent affects,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social practice; Affect; Social capital; Identity; Diverse economies,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; VALUES,"The potential of co-operative working within the farming sector has received increasing interest in recent years, given a range of potential benefits. However, uncertainty persists in understanding the balance between individual and collective priority, how members inter-relate and negotiate these different motivations over time, and how this connects to different forms of outcome. This paper evaluates the experiences of the Pontbren farmer co-operative in Mid-Wales (UK) to explore these issues, as an exemplar of the multiple and sometimes unexpected outcomes of co-operative activity. Here-in day-to-day practices and emotional affects are highlighted as critical elements of co-operation alongside the skills and know-how required to sustain working relations. In addition, the farmers' changing sense of self is considered to evaluate the extent to which co-operation can bring about new forms of identification. The approach outlined aims to augment existing Bourdieu-inspired readings of social learning and capital exchange with insights from the literature on social practice and diverse economies (following the work of Elizabeth Shove, J.K. Gibson-Graham and colleagues). Overall, findings demonstrate a need to frame co-operation as an emergent process which can move the individuals involved beyond preformed judgements and measures of social positioning, altering their conceptions of how to relate to others. Moreover, it is argued that the value of this relatedness needs to be understood in more expansive terms, and not only as calculable forms of 'capital'. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Its relevancy and necessity are under continuous scrutiny as the number of farmers and the political power of the agricultural vote diminishes. These challenges provide an excellent opportunity to explore alternative sources of funding for the USCES and methods of technology transfer to farmers. Our objectives were to review the process and results of commercialization (the transition to user-paid consultancy) and privatization (the transition from government to privately owened) of New Zealand's agricultural extension service. Full commercialization of the New Zealand extension service took nearly 9 yr (1986 to 1994) and 3 yr (1992 to 1995) of negotiating before it was sold to a private company. During the commercialization process, the market for paid advisors increased and many of them left the public extension service to become private agricultural consultants. Many farmers were initially unwilling to pay for consultancy services. On the other hand, implementation of advice and adoption of new technologies has been greater among farmers when advice and technology are purchased than when they are provided free. Since the commercialization of publicly funded extension, farmer cooperatives and commodity boards have begun to provide free or low cost services to transfer information to farmers. Educational models and goals, and client-advisor relationships have also changed as a result of user-pays. The commercialization and privatization of publicly funded agricultural extension is a relatively new process and its affect on the long-term sustainability of agriculture within a country are uncertain. Consequently, additional in-depth investigation into the process and its long-term consequences on agricultural productivity, profitability, and social well-being should be completed before initiating such a plan in the USA.","Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Hall, MH (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, 116 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,,25,7,7,0,21,AMER SOC AGRONOMY,MADISON,"677 S SEGOE RD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0890-8524,,,J PROD AGRIC,J.

Particular concern has arisen around whether the current approach of individual, farm-level, AES agreements are sufficient to offer landscape-scale environmental protection and enhancement. Whilst recent additions to AESs have sought to encourage more joined-up thinking by offering payments to farmers to form collective agreements, uptake is low and there is very little known about farmers' (non)resistance to such collective conservation. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research with 74 farms across 5 sites in the UK, this paper provides new data on the barriers to farmers' uptake of collective AESs and offers a new formulation of how we understand farming cooperation. The paper advances Bourdieusian-inspired ideas of the cultural construct of 'good farming' by synthesising these with recent reconceptualizations of 'trust' in order to provide a more contextually grounded and temporally-inflected understanding of farmers' cooperative activities. The findings reveal that whilst working relations between farmers are often collegiate, and in places collective, several watershed events over past decades have led to a shift from community-level to process-based (peer-to-peer) trust and a move toward land management being depicted as a squarely individual rather than collective issue. Conceptually, the paper moves beyond the current limitation of viewing trust, and the associated development of social capital - seen as a prerequisite for more collective AESs - as cumulative and one-directional to highlighting their multiple, issue-specific, nature which may become eroded and (re)developed over time. Alongside this, the paper offers a new way of understanding the good farmer by shifting the focus from the individual farm/farmer level to a more fine-grained and contextualised issue-centered notion of good farming. This is then used to explain the seeming reluctance of land holders, evidenced in official statistics, to engage in collective AESs.","[Riley, Mark; Sangster, Heather; Smith, Hugh; Chiverrell, Richard; Boyle, John] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, 413 Roxby Bldg, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Riley, M (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, 413 Roxby Bldg, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England.",mark.riley@liverpool.ac.uk; Heather.Sangster@liverpool.ac.uk; Hugh.Smith@liverpool.ac.uk; R.C.Chiverrell@liverpool.ac.uk; Jfb@liverpool.ac.uk,"Smith, Hugh/AAX-7006-2020","Smith, Hugh/0000-0003-0292-0284; Sangster, Heather/0000-0001-6024-9041; Boyle, John/0000-0002-1172-1079; Chiverrell, Richard/0000-0002-7307-2756",Leverhulme Trust [RPG-2014-154]; Farmers' Club grant; Leverhulme Research Fellowship (Leverhulme Trust) [RF-2017-210\7],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Farmers' Club grant; Leverhulme Research Fellowship (Leverhulme Trust),"This paper was supported by a Research Project Grant (RPG-2014-154) awarded by The Leverhulme Trust, travel support from the University of Liverpool, and also a Farmers' Club grant and a Leverhulme Research Fellowship (Leverhulme Trust - RF-2017-210\7) for Mark Riley.

The investigation is possible due to the unique characteristics of the organisational form and region being examined-credit unions in Northern Ireland. The sector has not been subject to external regulation on board gender, yet a wide array of gender mix on boards ranging from 100 % male to 100 % female are in existence. In addition, effective financial management is crucial to their survival and their ability to meet member objectives.

The availability of these water resources, however, is extremely seasonal because of the patterns of the annual rain season(s) and the increasing effects of climate change all over the world. A survey was conducted at Golinga and Botanga irrigation schemes in Northern Ghana where 200 respondents were interviewed. The objectives of this study include: (i) to assess the management and sustainability of irrigation projects, (ii) to find out the impact of the irrigation projects on rural communities' development, (iii) to find out the challenges that hinders farmers from effectively using irrigation water from the perspective of farmers and to find the possible solutions to the challenges. 38 and 40% of respondents from Golinga and Botanga irrigation schemes respectively agreed that cropping areas have moderately expanded due to the presence of irrigation scheme however, 52 and 39% of respondents from both schemes respectively indicated that the presence of the irrigation scheme to them has little impact in helping farmers expand their cropping areas. There was also moderate increase in crop yields in both communities due to the constant water supply to farmers obtained from irrigation projects. The study shows that the major challenge that hinders farmers from using irrigation water is the high cost of renting irrigable land for farming in the irrigation schemes indicated by a response of 47 and 64% amongst farmers in Botanga and Golinga irrigation schemes respectively. The study suggests that the need for relevant stakeholders to; revise the cost of renting irrigable lands, acquire and adopt the use of simple and affordable technologies (machines), implement reforms and policies to reduce land consolidation and fragmentation, organize and mobilize farmers in farmer cooperatives to promote collective marketing and organize capacity building sessions for farmers regarding the project sustainability.","[Alhassan, Mohammed] Bursa Uludag Univ, Inst Nat Sci, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey; [Buyukcangaz, Hakan] Bursa Uludag Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biosyst Engn, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey",Uludag University; Uludag University,"Buyukcangaz, H (corresponding author), Bursa Uludag Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biosyst Engn, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",cangaz@uludag.edu.tr,"Büyükcangaz, Hakan/AAH-2934-2021",,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

They are using chemical input according to own experience and the instruction on the package, under the guidance of the government, and under the guidance and monitoring of cooperatives. The findings of empirical analysis highlight the role of social capital in influencing the way farmers use chemical input. The awareness of common goals incentivizes farmers to use fertilizer under the guidance of the government and cooperatives, while all the three aspects of social capital are significantly associated with the way that farmers use pesticide. To be specific, farmers in a cooperative with a higher level of communication, trust, and common goals display the tendency to using chemical input based on external guidance rather than own experience.","[Zhou, Jiehong; Liang, Qiao] China Acad Rural Dev, Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing] China Acad Rural Dev, Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Liang, Q (corresponding author), China Acad Rural Dev, Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",runzhou@zju.edu.cn; 11320056@zju.edu.cn; liangqiao2323@126.com,,"Zhou, Jiehong/0000-0002-1967-780X; Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573227, 71773109, 71333011]; Project of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education in China [14YJC790089]; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science [17NDJC193YB]; fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education in China; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science; fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71573227, 71773109, 71333011); the Project of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education in China (grant number 14YJC790089); Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 17NDJC193YB), and the fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,85,37,38,4,78,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JAN,2018,70,,,,,,394,401,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.001,,,8,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR9TS,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000419416600037,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper demonstrates that such a governance rule may enhance the survival of such organizational forms in the face of adverse incentives created by accumulated financial surpluses and identifies factors that may prompt conversion to a joint-stock form. The analysis is based on noting that current members collectively have inherited accumulated surpluses of the cooperative from past members. Older members have an incentive to extract maximum personal private benefit from that inheritance by voting to convert from a cooperative to a joint stock company, even though such an outcome may be socially suboptimal. A simple overlapping generations model is used to develop a sustainability constraint, which must be met if conversion is not to occur and examine how a one-member/one-vote governance rule contributes to the survival of the institution in a cooperative form.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Davis, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",,,,,,,,15,25,25,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0920-8550,,,J FINANC SERV RES,J.

In particular, this paper examines the case of a little-known deposit insurance scheme run by credit unions in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that has operated without once incurring a deficit for 70 years despite offering the kind of unlimited deposit insurance frowned upon by policymakers. We find that the provincial government played an important role in constituting the scheme and helping it operate, effectively, as a polycentric commons that until recently, satisfied all the design principles that tend to characterize successful collective management. The resulting argument is simple: it would be difficult to understand the stability of Saskatchewan's credit union deposit insurance scheme without also understanding how government supported its operation as a commons.","[Pigeon, Marc-Andre Joseph] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Pigeon, MAJ (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",marc-andre.pigeon@usask.ca,,"Pigeon, Marc-Andre/0000-0003-4172-0250",,,,,57,0,0,1,3,"IGITUR, UTRECHT PUBLISHING & ARCHIVING SERVICES",URTRECHT,"POSTBUS 80124, URTRECHT, 3508 TC, NETHERLANDS",1875-0281,,,INT J COMMONS,Int.

Four data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are presented and compared with the equity to asset ratio, and with the government regulator's extensively modified Z-score model. The equity/asset ratio is shown to provide as good a prediction of failure as any of the other models, and is not improved upon by the much more complex Z-score model. The best DEA model provides results comparable to the equity/asset ratio when a slack adjusted efficiency score is used to measure efficiency, particularly for Credit Unions with larger asset sizes. However, DEA also provides indications of where opportunities lie for improvements by weak units by providing specific information, relevant to managers. Hence, for each Credit Union, comparison is made with a peer group of efficient entities that the inefficient institution's management can emulate to improve their performance.

Design/methodology/approach - With a sample of 315 cooperatives over the period from 2007 to 2014, this research uses a two-stage process: application of regression models with panel data to verify which variables are related to the defined outputs, with the reduction of 31 variables to 8 variables in both models; and application of the data envelopment analysis method to obtain an analysis of credit unions' efficiency. Findings - The results demonstrate a high level of efficiency in financial intermediation, with low variation over time, associated with a low efficiency in the banking service, in which few cooperatives have remained efficient over time. In addition, the cooperatives with highest efficiency in financial intermediation were also the most efficient in providing services. Research limitations/implications - This research has some limitations about the capacity of the proxies used to capture the real effect of the variables and assumptions of economic relations resulting in restrictions to generalize the results. Practical implications - Cooperatives are usually analyzed under just one dimension. By separating the analysis into financial intermediation and banking services, cooperatives that are more efficient in each dimension can be identified, in addition to analyzing the evolution over time. The authors found that efficiency tends to be lower in banking services, and few cooperatives remain at the highest level of efficiency over time in both models. Social implications - Credit unions provide an important service in the banking and credit market. Therefore, understanding its operation and the characteristics that influence its efficiency allows a better management of the cooperatives themselves and a greater understanding of this important segment of the financial market.","[Barros, Manuela Goncalves] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Sch Adm & Accounting Sci, Dept Accounting Sci, Cuiaba, Brazil; [da Costa Moraes, Marcelo Botelho; Salgado Junior, Alexandre Pereira; Alves de Souza Junior, Marco Antonio] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Adm & Accounting Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Barros, MG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Sch Adm & Accounting Sci, Dept Accounting Sci, Cuiaba, Brazil.",manuelagb@hotmail.com,"da Costa Moraes, Marcelo Botelho/H-7931-2012","da Costa Moraes, Marcelo Botelho/0000-0003-0761-0883; Goncalves Barros, Manuela/0000-0003-0325-8106",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior Brasil (CAPES) [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.,,42,0,0,2,7,"UNIV SAO PAULO, FAC ECONOMIA",SAO PAULO SP,"TECSI LAB TECNOLOGIA E SISTEMAS INFORMACAO, AV PROF LUCIANO GUALBERTO., 908 FEA 3, SALA F184, SAO PAULO SP, 05508-900, BRAZIL",2531-0488,,,RAUSP MANAG J,RAUSP Manag.

Just as climatic profiles will influence the future viability of crops, institutions, i.e., governance agreements, rural household and community norms, local associations, markets, and agricultural ministries, to name but a few, create the conditions that foster sustainable food systems. Because discussions of agricultural sustainability often overlook the full range of social dimensions, we propose a dual focus on a broad set of criteria, i.e., human health, labor, democratic participation, resiliency, biological and cultural diversity, equity, and ethics, to assess social outcomes, and on institutions that could support diversified farming systems (DFS). A comparative analysis of case studies from California's Central Valley, Mesoamerican coffee agroforestry systems, and European Union agricultural parks finds that DFS practices are unevenly adopted within and among these systems and interdependent with institutional environments that specifically promote diversified farming practices. Influential institutions in these cases include state policies, farmers' cooperatives/associations, and organized civic efforts to influence agroenvironmental policy, share knowledge, and shape markets for more 'sustainable' products. The Californian and Mesoamerican cases considers organic and fair trade certifications, finding that although they promote several DFS practices and generate social benefits, they are inadequate as a single strategy to promote agricultural sustainability. The complex governance and multifunctional management of Europe's peri-urban agricultural parks show unexpected potential for promoting DFS. Unless DFS are anchored in supportive institutions and evaluated against an inclusive set of social and environmental criteria, short-term investments to advance diversified agriculture could miss a valuable opportunity to connect ecological benefits with social benefits in the medium and long terms.","[Bacon, Christopher M.; Holland, Kaelin] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Getz, Christy; Montenegro, Maywa] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Santa Clara University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bacon, CM (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",,"Bacon, Christopher/AAD-8480-2019","Bacon, Christopher/0000-0002-2534-6900",,,,,99,99,104,7,220,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Promoting the marketing capability of farmers especially the smallholders is the key challenge of increasing farm investment. The rice farmers generally have channels selling to (1) the brokers or commission men who come and collect at the farm gate, (2) the collectors or traders at the farm gate, and (3) selling directly to the rice mills nearby towns. Assessing from different channels is central for exploiting the potential to increase production, farm income and investment. However there are restrictions in channel choices because of poor infrastructure, lack of marketing facilities, insufficient credit and up to date market information. Moreover, due to the oligopsony market structure and without organization, individual marketing practices exposes them to high transaction costs with low bargaining position. The majority of farmers unable to receive a fair price as they have to sell their products soon after harvest when the price is generally low because of the immediate cash need for repayment. So, the farmers cannot maximize profit which in turn affects the future investment of paddy farmers. This paper investigates the factors determine the marketing channel choice using the Multinomial Logit Model. The results show the probability of selling at the farm gate is increase with the distance to market. The farmers who possess storage, transportation, larger quantity and access of market information are more likely to sell the remunerative direct marketing channels to the rice mills directly. The result underscore the importance of forming the farmers' cooperative, development of marketing infrastructures, accessibility of up to date marketing information in order to support farmers bargaining power to develop farm's profit and investment.","[Moritaka, Masahiro; Fukuda, Susumu] Kyushu Univ, Div Agr & Resource Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Lab Food Mkt & Distribut,Fac Agr, Fukuoka 812858, Japan; [Soe, Win Pa Pa] Kyushu Univ, Lab Food Mkt & Distribut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Fukuoka 812858, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Fukuda, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Div Agr & Resource Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Lab Food Mkt & Distribut,Fac Agr, Fukuoka 812858, Japan.",sufukuda@kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,26,13,13,1,19,"KYUSHU UNIV, FACULTY AGRICULTURAL PUBLICATIONS",FUKUOKA-SHI,"6-10-1 HAKOZAKI, HIGASHI-KU, FUKUOKA-SHI, 812-0053, JAPAN",0023-6152,,,J FAC AGR KYUSHU U,J.

In addition, this study separately examines incentives for commercial banks and credit unions during the program. Design/methodology/approach - Using 2020 PPP loan data, the authors create a proxy for lender loan prioritization by comparing the skewness statistics of large and small loan distributions. A regression model is used to examine lender reporting incentives and loan prioritization. Findings - Results show that larger borrowers were prioritized in receiving PPP loans earlier. Lenders with financial reporting concerns and commercial banks favored large borrowers to a greater extent. Practical implications - This study may inform social planners and regulators about the benefits and costs of delegating emergency funding loan decisions to financial institutions. Originality/value - The authors believe this paper is the first to examine financial institution reporting incentives in relationship to PPP lending practices. It adds novelty by examining lender incentives, while prior research has focused heavily on the economic consequences of the program and how borrower-lender relationships affected loan practices during the program.","[Bailey, Cristina; Sokolowski, Matias] Univ New Mexico, Anderson Sch Management, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Sokolowski, M (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Anderson Sch Management, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",msokolowski@unm.edu,,", Cristina/0000-0002-2804-158X; Sokolowski, Matias/0000-0001-5375-3338",,,,,37,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0307-4358,1758-7743,,MANAG FINANC,Manag.

Water table depth and groundwater salinity are important factors in irrigation systems, not only for plant growth but for human health as well. The objective of this study was to determine the impact on water table depth and groundwater salinity for transferring management of the Mustafakemalpasa irrigation project (19, 370 ha) in north-western Turkey to local, farmer controlled irrigation districts. Maps of water table depth and groundwater salinity were created for the a month of July (averaged over several years), the month with the highest amount of applied irrigation water, based on measurements made in 200 wells in the project area before and after transfer of managerial control. Both depth of the water table and salinity decreased after transfer The area with average water table depth of 100-200 cm was 25.41% of total area before turnover and 79.45% after and the area with water table depth 200-300 cm was 73.4% before turnover and 20.50% after before turnover, the area with average groundwater salinity 1.5-2.0 dS/m was 26.16% of total area, and that with average salinity 2.0-2.5 dS/m was 61.73% of total area; after turnover, average groundwater salinity was 1.5-2.0 dS/m in over all areas. Both changes were the consequence of an increased amount of applied water after transfer of the control of irrigation management from the state to local irrigatior districts controlled by farmers. In the short run, the farmers will get benefit from increased irrigation. However, over the long term, if water table depth continues to decrease then secondary salinization could become a major hindrance to irrigation sustainability.","Uludag Univ, Agr Struct & Irrigat Dept, Fac Agr, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey",Uludag University,"Gundogdu, KS (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Agr Struct & Irrigat Dept, Fac Agr, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",kemalg@uludag.edu.tr,"GUNDOGDU, KEMAL/ABI-4047-2020; ASLAN, ?ER?FE TÜL?N AKKAYA/AAL-5730-2020; AKKAYA ASLAN, ?ER?FE TÜL?N/N-9721-2013","ASLAN, ?ER?FE TÜL?N AKKAYA/0000-0001-5129-8642; AKKAYA ASLAN, ?ER?FE TÜL?N/0000-0001-5129-8642",,,,,25,1,1,0,4,TRIVENI ENTERPRISES,LUCKNOW,"C/O KIRAN DALELA, 1/206 VIKAS NAGAR, KURSI RD, LUCKNOW 226 022, INDIA",0254-8704,,,J ENVIRON BIOL,J.Environ.Biol.,APR,2007,28,2,,S,,,455,459,,,,,,5,Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,160QR,17929765,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000245957900020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main objective is to compare sources of knowledge through the content analysis of the service operations strategy as proposed by the literature and validated by specialists. Design/methodology/approach This research is a qualitative study that uses the knowledge of specialists to frame a performance assessment structure applied to credit unions. The research strategy is based on multicriteria analysis, and the selected techniques are based on the MCDA-C procedure, that is, the processes of structuring, evaluating and recommending improvements. Findings The research results provided: a data set external to the context that serves as theoretical support for the comparisons made; the structuring of 4 unique organisational performance assessment models carried out through the MCDA-C procedure; conceptual interpretation using the lens of the operations strategy in the cognitive maps of the assessment models, which identifies the operations strategy carried out; and comparison of the result models that show their uniqueness. Originality/value The comparison between the origins of knowledge is highlighted, and the demonstration of the content was proposed by the literature and by specialists to evaluate the performance in operations. This was then compared with the content constructed with credit union managers in structuring models based on the singularities of the respective contexts. The theory was compared to practice, and it was demonstrated how the content of the operations regarding the performance could be used in decision contexts.","[Martins, Poliana; de Lima, Edson Pinheiro; Bortoluzzi, Sandro Cesar; Gouvea da Costa, Sergio E.] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Pato Branco, Brazil; [Martins, Poliana] Ctr Univ Pato Branco, Pato Branco, Brazil; [de Lima, Edson Pinheiro; Gouvea da Costa, Sergio E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Ind & Syst Engn, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana,"Martins, P (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Pato Branco, Brazil.;Martins, P (corresponding author), Ctr Univ Pato Branco, Pato Branco, Brazil.",polianamartins2@gmiail.com,"Pinheiro de Lima, Edson/I-4560-2012; Gouvea da Costa, Sergio E./I-5575-2014","Pinheiro de Lima, Edson/0000-0001-9331-1569; Gouvea da Costa, Sergio E./0000-0002-9882-5857",,,,,56,3,3,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0401,1758-6658,,INT J PRODUCT PERFOR,Int.

In the last two decades, the definition of what constitutes a common bond has expanded dramatically.

These have been facilitated by state institutions. Maximization of returns through commercial agriculture has been the main objective of FCs. However, no FCs were operating by the year 2010. This article explains that the institutional facilitation is a strong ingredient in the establishment of FCs in Sri Lanka. This article explains how the institutional and governance arrangements of FCs were influenced by the facilitating institutions during the institutional facilitation. It also suggests that institutional facilitation affected the performance of FCs. Six failed FCs were studied. Strategic facilitation was responsible for the performance and sustainability of FCs while operative facilitation provided the basis for direction and operations. Results indicate that poor performance and failure of FCs were due to institutional facilitation that has introduced weak institutional and governance arrangements. There was nonshareholder influence on the Boards of Directors; geographically restricted shareholding; democratic voting rights; and shareholder rights not linked to equity or patronage. Governance problems included voting by the raise of hand; managers not reporting to the Boards directly; shareholders did not elect all the directors. Institutional facilitation of FCs in Sri Lanka has been done by the state facilitating institutions. They have been excessively authoritative on their respective FCs. Therefore, changing the label from cooperatives to companies would not result in better performance. Some recommendations are that facilitating institutions empower FCs through capacity-building; participatory approach in facilitation; remove the geographical restriction in shareholding; install variable shareholding; build capacity of managerial staff; use secret ballots at voting, and practice proportional voting. Understanding the role of facilitating institutions and the dynamics of facilitation would be useful to promote farmer collectives in smallholder farmer dominant developing countries.","[Rosairo, H.

Yet explanation is still inadequate of how 'governing through the community' is conducted in practice, particularly the specific mechanisms that regulate interaction among government agencies, groups seeking to represent the community and individuals in the community. In this study, we find that 'governing through the community' is actually 'governing through representatives of the community' because it is the representatives that make the community visible and governable. This observation is based on a case study of three kinds of farmer organizations, in two states of Australia, who see their role as serving the community and are regarded by outsiders as representatives of the community at least on certain issues. An understanding of the interaction among different stakeholders within and outside of the community is developed through three themes of 'paperwork', 'data' and 'price' that were used by locals from Landcare groups, grower groups and farmer cooperatives, respectively, to articulate how they experience the mechanisms through which their interactions are regulated. This paper concludes that these groups can claim to represent some residents within a defined geographical area, rather than any exact definition of 'the community' and that this is a sufficient claim to enable these groups to participate in the process of 'governing through the community'. The tensions between government agencies, community representatives and community members threaten the legitimacy of the community representatives as intermediaries. Government agencies do try to contribute to reduce these tensions by strengthening the legitimacy of community representatives through various policy and project mechanisms. However, while the stated aim of 'governing through the community' is often focused on producing a 'flourishing rural community' through improving democratic modes of representation, this study demonstrates that it is only part of the community, namely the 'targeted customers' of the farmer organizations, that is potentially reachable to 'the state'.

Hence, this study intends to investigate the association between audit committee attributes namely audit committee expertise and experience, audit committee meeting frequency and audit committee size to the timeliness reporting compliance among Malaysian cooperative societies. Using qualitative research methods, 158 usable questionnaires from 59 cooperative societies were successfully gathered and analysed using SmartPLS 3 Version 3.2.8. The results obtained provided support to the notion that there is a significant positive relationship between the frequency of meetings on the timeliness reporting compliance and a significant positive relationship between audit committee size on the timeliness reporting compliance. However, the notion expecting a significant positive relationship between the expertise of the audit committee on the timeliness reporting compliance proved to be insignificant. Conclusively, the study provides theoretical and practical support to both literature and practitioners on the importance of having optimum audit committee size and high frequency of meeting in ensuring the timeliness compliance of financial reporting of cooperative societies.","[Jusoh, Yusri Huzaimi Mat; Abd Razak, Siti Noor Azmawaty; Noor, Wan Nurul Basirah Wan Mohamad] Univ Teknol MARA Cawangan Kelantan, Fac Accountancy, Machang, Malaysia; [Hudayati, Ataina; Puspaningsih, Abriyani] Univ Islam Indonesia, Accounting Dept, Fac Business & Econ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Nadzri, Farah Aida Ahmad] Univ Teknol MARA, Accounting Res Inst, HICoE, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universitas Islam Indonesia; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Hudayati, A (corresponding author), Univ Islam Indonesia, Accounting Dept, Fac Business & Econ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",ataina.hudayati@uii.ac.id,,,,,,,78,2,2,1,5,UNIV ECONOMICS & HUMAN SCIENCES WARSAW,WARSAW,"OKOPOWA 59, WARSAW, 01-043, POLAND",2084-0845,2300-8814,,CONTEMP ECON,Contemp.

The potential of household farms to supply beef for the market and their competition with large farms were examined. The fieldwork was done in 2007 on 73 farms consisting of 58 small mixed farms (small farms), 10 medium mixed farms (medium farms) and 5 specialised large-scale beef farms (large farms) in Son La province. The three types of farm differed in ethnicity (Thai, H'mong, and Kinh), remoteness (lowland, highland), production objectives (subsistence, market output), degree of specialization (mixed farm, specialised beef farm) and integration of production (single farmers, cooperative). Data on biological productivity, inputs and outputs, and the social contribution of cattle production were collected by household and key person interviews, participatory rural appraisal tools and cattle body measurements. Economic values were derived by assessment of market or replacement costs. Quantitative data analysis was done with linear models (PROC GLM) in the SAS software (version 9.1). Lowland small farms had higher costs for cattle production than the highland farms (0.8 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1) compared with 0.02 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1), respectively). The large farms had high production costs, with an average of 2.5-3.6 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1). Cattle brought high benefits of non-cash values to the household farms. The total revenue from cattle was in the range 4.5-11.5 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1), which depended on the use of non-market functions of cattle on the household farm. The value of net benefit/kg live weight (LW) of lowland small farms with an average of 39,000 VND/kg LW was significantly higher than that of the medium and small farms in the highlands (26,000 VND/kg LW). However, the small farms kept fewer cattle than the medium farms (average of 2-4 cattle/farm compared with 9 cattle/farm, respectively) because of forage and labour shortages and have no option to further develop cattle production. Keeping larger numbers of cattle based on available natural pasture brought high benefit from stock Value as farm liquidity to only the medium farms. This was the most promising type of farm for future development of beef production, given its actual success and the availability of underutilised resources. Large-scale farms suffered high economic losses of 0.3-1.4 Mill. VND cattle(-1) year(-1), due to the lack of professional management, high feed costs and low animal performance, and showed no potential for developing cattle production. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This article explains the sociohistorical and theoretical implications of YDP-UIM under the supervision of the Presbyterian Church of Korea into the following three aspects. First, many democratic labor unions supported or led by YDP-UIM played a significant role historically in establishing the Korean Federation of Trade Unions. Second, credit unions introduced to the GIC by YDP-UIM saw unexpected success in protecting GIC industrial workers from falling prey to institutionalized usurers, and the National Credit Union Federation of Korea has grown today to become the world's third largest credit union federation. In-depth interviews with YDP-UIM's leading activists, however, repeatedly reveal that their practical innovation was the result of their self-reflective interaction with industrial workers alienated from religion itself as well from established society. Finally, these interviews point out how and why the positive relationship between religious innovation and free competition posited by religious market theorists should be revised, both theoretically and empirically, in the Korean context.","[Yoo, Kwangsuk] Kyung Hee Univ, Sociol, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yoo, K (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Sociol, Seoul, South Korea.",ksyooii@khu.ac.kr,,"Yoo, Kwang Suk/0000-0001-6427-9547",National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2015S1A3A2046920]; John Templeton Foundation,"National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); John Templeton Foundation","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, funded by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea (NRF-2015S1A3A2046920), as well as by the John Templeton Foundation.",,52,1,1,0,2,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2017,57,4,,,,,98,117,,,,,,20,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,FR3ZA,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000419004100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this purpose, the dynamic imperfect competition model, in which processors are allowed to exert market power in both downstream (selling dairy products) and upstream (buying raw milk from dairy farmers) was applied. Market power parameters, dairy products demand, and raw milk supply elasticities were jointly estimated in a system of equations including market margin, dairy demand, and raw milk supply equations by none linear estimation technique. Data for the period 1992 to 2012 on the industry level were used for estimating an empirical version of the model. The result indicated that conjectural elasticities values were a departure from zero, which reflected non-competitive behavior in dairy market and in raw milk market specifically. Among three dairy products including pasteurized milk, yogurt, and cheese, the conjectural elasticity was the highest for the pasteurized market and the lowest for yogurt. The result suggests that dairy industries processors exercise marketing power in the downstream and upstream market in the dairy products supply chain. Therefore, policymakers must make appropriate policy for facilitating entrance conditions for new dairy processors and improve farmers' marketing cooperative so as to have more competitive raw milk price.","[Chizari, A.

In Nigeria, housing finance is through the formal and informal institutions; and personal residences accounted between 75 and 90 per cent of household wealth, that represents between 3 and 6 times their annual income. Finance is an important determinant of success and failure of housing ownership. It, therefore, becomes very necessary to identify viable sources of funding that can promote house-ownership. This paper examined the activities of Cooperative Societies in the provision of funds for house ownership in Nigeria with a focus on Akure. In the conduct of the social survey for the study; two sets of questionnaire were used. The first set of the questionnaire focused on House-owners and 683 sampled houses-owners were administered with the questionnaire in Akure. The second set of questionnaire was administered on the government officers' incharge of the administration of the cooperative societies in Akure. The answers to the questions in the questionnaire were adequately supplied. The data were subjected to statistical analysis. The findings revealed among others that the main sources of funding house buildings were through personal savings and Cooperative Societies among others.

In a low-interest rate environment, this effect may be even stronger as financial institutions try to reach for yield. In this paper, we use the 2008 introduction of unlimited deposit insurance for all credit unions in the province of British Columbia, Canada, to examine the effect of government guarantees on financial institutions' earnings uncertainty. We find that the policy change resulted in an economically and statistically significant decrease in earnings uncertainty. In addition, although deposits grew following the policy change, lending did not increase and instead capitalization ratios improved. Overall, our results suggest that the provincial government guarantee boosted depositor confidence and increased the flow of funds to the insured financial institutions. We do not find support for the risk-taking hypothesis but instead show that risk management improved following the policy change.

Data obtained through a survey of 150 cocoa farmers were analyzed through three main statistical methods: (1) an exploratory factor analysis with a principal component analysis method; (2) cluster analysis; and (3) an independent samples t-test. The results confirm that farmer satisfaction is explained by a complex set of cognitive and psycho-social elements and pro-social emotions.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the affect theory of social exchange, a theoretical model was developed and empirically tested using a survey of 691 employees from 15 North American credit unions. Findings - The negotiated mode of knowledge exchange, i.e. when a knowledge contributor explicitly establishes reciprocation conditions with a recipient, develops negative knowledge sharing attitude. The reciprocal mode, i.e. when a knowledge donor assumes that a receiver will reciprocate, has no effect on knowledge sharing attitude. The generalized exchange form, i.e. when a knowledge contributor believes that other organizational members may reciprocate, is weakly related to knowledge sharing attitude. The productive exchange mode, i.e. when a knowledge provider assumes he or she is a responsible citizen within a cooperative enterprise, strongly facilitates the development of knowledge sharing attitude, which, in turn, leads to knowledge sharing intentions. Practical implications - To facilitate inter-employee knowledge sharing, managers should focus on the development of positive knowledge sharing culture when all employees believe they contribute to a common good instead of expecting reciprocal benefits. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to apply the affect theory of social exchange to study knowledge sharing.","[Serenko, Alexander] Lakehead Univ, Fac Business Adm, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada; [Bontis, Nick] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Lakehead University; McMaster University,"Serenko, A (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Fac Business Adm, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.",aserenko@lakeheadu.ca,"Serenko, Alexander/AAT-2082-2020","Serenko, Alexander/0000-0003-4881-2932; Bontis, Nick/0000-0002-8347-0870",,,,,172,51,54,7,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1367-3270,1758-7484,,J KNOWL MANAG,J.

Growing multi local economic activity stimulates innovative enterprises for cooperation with stakeholders. Usually, it means consumers, suppliers, authorities and government involvement in change processes. If achievement of interests balance is clear and transparent for all stakeholders, they will be change agents. Modern experience in streamlining social and economic relations between stakeholders focuses on the development of functional institutions that can act as agents of change. Forms of organization of such institutions can be clusters, technology parks, holdings, management companies, joint-stock companies, state-owned companies, manufacturers' associations, marketing cooperatives, and professional communities. Research methods are statistics index analysis and network analysis. Working with these research methods, World Bank Input-Output Database, Federal Custom data, Rosstat data and law searching system we prove impossibility of full-fledged cluster policy implementation. Finally we prove that present Russian institutes are complacent and require more transparency. Consequently, cluster progression needs for common institutional space, supporting clear and transparent transactions between stakeholders, regardless of their location and technologies used.","[Korostyshevskaya, Elena; Chudakov, Anatoliy] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Korostyshevskaya, E (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",e.korostyshevskaya@spbu.ru,"Elena, korostyshevskaya/K-8242-2015","Elena, korostyshevskaya/0000-0001-9722-6898",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-2424,,,SHS WEB CONF,,,2020,74,,,,,,,,6012,10.1051/shsconf/20207406012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/20207406012,,,9,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BO8LI,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000528040800140,View Full Record in Web of Science

These calls have received recent impetus from the challenge of climate change. Arguments for landholder involvement in kangaroo production include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, better management of total grazing pressure, reduced land degradation, improved vegetation and biodiversity outcomes, and greater valuation of kangaroos by landholders. However, there is little understanding of how landholders could be involved in kangaroo harvest and production, and there is a widespread misconception that this would include domestication, fencing, mustering and trucking. This paper reviews the options for landholder involvement in managing and harvesting wild kangaroos, and assesses the possible benefits and feasibility of such options. We conclude that collaboration among landholders, as well as between landholders and harvesters, forms the basis of any preferred option, and set out a proposed operating model based on the formation of a kangaroo management, processing and marketing co-operative.","[Cooney, Rosie; Baumber, Alex; Ampt, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Fate Program, Inst Environm Studies, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Wilson, George] Australian Wildlife Serv, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Cooney, R (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Fate Program, Inst Environm Studies, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.",rosie.cooney@unsw.edu.au,"Baumber, Alex Patrick/AAW-9840-2020","Baumber, Alex Patrick/0000-0001-8560-8661; Cooney, Rosie/0000-0001-8384-8469",,,,,40,10,12,1,18,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2009,31,3,,,,,283,292,,10.1071/RJ08025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ08025,,,10,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,489FW,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000269406500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Marine Areas for Responsible Fishing (Areas Marinas de Pesca Responsable, AMPR) have emerged as a new model for the co-management of small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica, one that involves collaboration between fishers, government agencies, and NGOs. The primary objective of this paper is to elucidate some of the key variables that influence collective action among small-scale fishers in Tarcoles, a community in the Gulf of Nicoya. We examined collective action for the formation of a local marketing cooperative and participation in management through the AMPR. We apply the social-ecological framework as a diagnostic and organizational tool in the analysis of several types of qualitative data, including interviews with key informants, informal interviews, legal documents, and gray literature. Findings illustrate the importance of socio-economic community attributes (e.g., group size, homogeneity, previous cooperation), as well as that of social (e.g., equity) and ecological (e.g., improved stocks) outcomes perceived as favorable by actors. In addition, our work demonstrates the importance of certain kinds of external NGOs for facilitating and sustaining collective action.","[Lozano, Alejandro J.

Using focus groups, a household survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets.

Findings - Knowledge hiding and knowledge sharing belong to unique yet possibly overlapping constructs. Individual employees believe that they engage in knowledge hiding to a lesser degree than their co-workers. The availability of knowledge management systems and knowledge policies has no impact on intra-organizational knowledge hiding. The existence of a positive organizational knowledge culture has a negative effect on intra-organizational knowledge hiding. In contrast, job insecurity motivates knowledge hiding. Employees may reciprocate negative knowledge behavior, and knowledge hiding promotes voluntary turnover.

As transaction costs are difficult to measure the theoretical framework of analysis is based on transaction costs economics of new institutional economics. The results revealed that the spot market-based governance structure was the most preferred market arrangements by smallholders farmers in north-central Namibia because vegetable farmers struggle to meet the quality and quantity standards as required by the contractors market-based and commission market-based arrangements. The results also suggest that due to incomplete information, farmers and market agents suffer from high transaction costs. Skewed information distribution between farmers and marketing agents leads to slow development of vegetable enterprises. The study recommends that information shared to farmers must be packaged in an adequate manner to minimise transaction costs in the vegetable value chain.","[Thomas, Benisiu; Vink, Nick] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Thomas, Benisiu] Univ Namibia, Dept Agr Econ, Private Bag 5520, Oshakati, Namibia",Stellenbosch University; University of Namibia,"Thomas, B (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",dengeinge@gmail.com,,,University of Namibia (UNAM); National Commission on Research Science and Technology (NCRST) of Namibia,University of Namibia (UNAM); National Commission on Research Science and Technology (NCRST) of Namibia,"The author thanks and greatly appreciate the materials and financial contributions for the study from the University of Namibia (UNAM) and National Commission on Research Science and Technology (NCRST) of Namibia, as well as the contributions of reviewers.",,42,2,2,1,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-1543,,,J AGR FOOD RES,J.

The superficial reason for such bad financial services in rural areas lies in the idea that people with little money are not suitable enough clients for financial institutions. Social discrepancies between urban and rural areas have been officially stated to exist in Latvia according to the report about social inclusion of the European Commission. Microfinance is seen as a widely accepted tool to combat these discrepancies. Nevertheless the vocabulary of microfinance can be understood only by professionals, even if it is intended for the masses. The sector is very fragmented, and there is not even a proper definition of the term yet. Activities in the Microfinance sector identified in Latvia can be assigned to the following models: credit unions; downscaling of commercial bank activities; and NGO based programmes and projects. Recommendations to improve the Microfinance sector in Latvia and especially to combine the existing trends of commercial banks to downsize their activities with supportive measures are: target subsidies toward institution building. providing incentives to encourage greater focus and innovation in the development of financial services for the poor; increasing cooperation and partnership, both among all types of microfinance providers and between them and mainstream banks, to increase financial service provision to the poor; improving the legal and regulatory environment for microfinance and for credit unions specifically Within all these discussions it is very important to emphasize that the access to advice, education and training is regarded as equally relevant as the access to finance. The advantage for Eastern Europe may be that there are much more industry sectors here to offer opportunities for rural development than in other regions of the world that suffer from bad infrastructures and low educational levels.","Latvia Univ Agr, Dept Accounting & Finances, Fac Econ, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Zarina, L (corresponding author), Latvia Univ Agr, Dept Accounting & Finances, Fac Econ, Jelgava, Latvia.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9997-1-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2008,,17,,,,,166,173,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BTX19,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000288353100022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The empirical study takes as a reference the horticultural sector in southeast Spain, since this area constitutes the highest concentration of small-scale farm production in Europe, where the climatic conditions allow the possibility of several harvests in year-round production, as well as several alternative crops. Firstly, we study the production programming for an individual farmer, under the assumption that their decisions do not affect the balance of market prices. In this case a modified Markowitz model is used for the scheduling of crop marketing. Secondly, we study the sales arrangements for a farming-marketing cooperative, under the assumption that their sales volume is such that the entity is capable of altering the market balance. A model of monthly revenues and margins is proposed, and the results show a clear improvement in both margins and revenues if the harvest is programmed in this way.","[Perez-Mesa, Juan C.] Univ Almeria, Dept Business Adm & Management, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Galdeano-Gomez, Emilio] Univ Almeria, Dept Appl Econ, La Canada De San Urban 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Aznar-Sanchez, Jose A.] Univ Almeria, Dept Appl Econ, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Pérez-Mesa, JC (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Business Adm & Management, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario CeiA3, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.",juancarl@ual.es; galdeano@ual.es; jaznar@ual.es,"Galdeano-Gómez, Emilio/J-9979-2014; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014; Sánchez, José Ángel Aznar/AAI-6038-2021","Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475; Sánchez, José Ángel Aznar/0000-0001-5443-1269; Galdeano Gomez, Emilio/0000-0001-5414-4331","Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid [ECO2008-02258, ECO2008-03445, ECO2011-24930]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ-5827]",Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"This research was partially funded by Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid (project ECO2008-02258, ECO2008-03445 and ECO2011-24930) and from Junta de Andalucia (project SEJ-5827, Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia).

In this study, numerous aspects responsible for the success of India's Dairy Cooperative Society (DCS) have been taken into account before developing a composite index. The criteria addressed include milk union support, DCS support, governance and management support, allied support, and common support factors for DCS performance evaluation. The current study is projected to empower the dairy industry by offering a tool that can evaluate the relative success of DCSs and assist milk unions and dairy organizations in tailoring their assistance to their specific requirements. We deployed the Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP) to determine the weights of specified criteria and sub-criteria impacting DCS performance; these weights were deployed to determine the relative performance of a DCS using the composite index developed in the study. Criteria such as governance and management support given to members, and support received from milk unions have significant weightage- 0.3002, 0.2854, and 0.2715, respectively. We also deployed the suggested technique to conduct a comparative analysis of 98 DCSs identified from six Indian provinces constituted under NDP I (National Dairy Plan, Phase-I).

Numerous studies have highlighted the role of intellectual capital as a key driver of organisational performance due to its importance as an asset in the value creation process, yet few have analysed the relationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction. Considering the relevance of knowledge management and intellectual capital in the service sector, namely in the banking system (Curado 2008; Starbuck 2002), this study aims to assess the structure of intellectual capital in a Brazilian Credit Union, and how it relates to internal communication and job satisfaction. To accomplish this objective, a structural model, based on Longo and Mura (2011), was developed and tested on a sample of 109 employees from a particular branch of the union. Results confirm the three-dimensionality of the Intellectual Capital construct and that job satisfaction, as well as internal communication, are constructs separate from intellectual capital and should not be confused. In fact, internal communication may be considered as an antecedent of intellectual capital, whereas job satisfaction is a consequence. Furthermore, results suggest that intellectual capital plays a mediation role in the relationship between internal communication and job satisfaction. Nevertheless, the framework presented in this paper is not without limitations. Firstly, the sample size and the fact that it is a case study requires caution regarding extrapolation of conclusions. A second limitation has to do with the measurement of Relational Capital, as items employed have shown to be problematic in terms of convergent validity. Nevertheless, this study holds great potential for the strategic management of human resources in banking, in particular credit unions, which is a prime concern for bank administrations, bank branch collaborators, and society at large. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model the interrelationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction in a credit union, an organisation with particular structural and strategic features resulting from its external customers being members and owners.","[Leal, Carmem; Marques, Carlos; Marques, Carla] Univ Tras os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Vila Real, Portugal; [Braga-Filho, Elizomar] UNICRED Joao Pessoa Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Leal, C (corresponding author), Univ Tras os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Vila Real, Portugal.",cleal@utad.pt; cmarques@utad.pt; smarques@utad.pt; elizomarfilho@live.com,"Marques, Carlos/P-8077-2016; Leal, Carmem P/V-7073-2017; Marques, Carla/U-2410-2018","Marques, Carlos/0000-0001-6274-9082; Leal, Carmem P/0000-0002-7860-9858; Marques, Carla/0000-0003-1557-1319",,,,,53,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,199,207,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000359062600024,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, its sector is experiencing many constraints and limited attention given to productivity and marketing. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the banana value chain in order to identify constraints on productivity and marketing, and possibilities of improvements towards a sustainable value chain in Arba Minch. Data were collected through a survey, key informants' interviews, and focus group discussions. Different analytical and statistical tools were used for data analysis. Results describe actors, supporters, and influencers of the existing banana chain. The current banana chain has three different distribution channels in Arba Minch. The channel that connects with rural consumers has the highest value share for farmers while the channel that includes traveling traders has the lowest value share for farmers. The marketing cooperative channel has an intermediate value share for farmers in the chain. Poor agronomic practice, diseases, pests, and climate change were the major constraints for the banana yield while limited market information, lack of cold store and refrigerated trucks, poor post-harvest handling, lack of alternative markets, and weak capacity of cooperatives were the main constraints for banana marketing in Arba Minch. Economic, social and environmental indicators have a moderate sustainability performance within the Ethiopian context. The chain has an advantage in terms of profitability, employment, emission of air pollutants and constraints in terms of coordination, value share, profit margin, market diversity, product and market information, transportation, waste management, and safety and hygiene.","[Gebre, Girma Gezimu] Aksum Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Aksum, Ethiopia; [Rik, Eweg; Kijne, Albertien] Van Hall Larstien Univ Appl Sci, Leeuwarden, Netherlands",,"Gebre, GG (corresponding author), Aksum Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Aksum, Ethiopia.",girma.gezimu@gmail.com; rik.eweg@hvhl.nl; albertien.kijne@hvhl.nl,"Gebre, Girma Gezimu/AAF-3120-2019","Gebre, Girma Gezimu/0000-0003-4875-8825",,,,,36,5,5,6,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1932,,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,APR 10,2020,6,1,,,,,,,1742516,10.1080/23311932.2020.1742516,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2020.1742516,,,31,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,LH7WY,,gold,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000528996400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We show that if the upstream firm is organized like a traditional cooperative, where the members have free delivery rights and where surplus is shared in proportion to the deliveries, the downstream firm is less subject to a holdup. The cooperative form makes it possible for the upstream firm to credibly commit to deliveries. Traditional cooperatives are often considered as suffering from a volume management problem, which leads to excessive deliveries. Remedying this problem is the objective of the so-called new generation cooperatives. In a supply chain context, however, this problem may actually be beneficial. Specifically, it limits the upstream firm's ability to hold up the downstream firm, which in turn makes possible specific downstream investments that are closer to first best. Our model lends structure to several real-world phenomena, including the apparent success of marketing cooperatives in farming, the success of open-end mutual funds, and the organization of aggregators in the new economy.

Design/methodology/approach By assuming the utility maximization behavior of farmers, based on data collected from 539 fruit and vegetable producers, this study estimates an intention to participate and a willingness to pay model. Findings Three groups of factors determine the utility the farmers derive and subsequently their engagement in brand development. Farm business characteristics include farmers' age, the attainment of quality certification and cultivated area, while psychological factors include farmers' attitudes toward local reflections of the brand, perceptions regarding the need for farm business external support and consumers' interest, as well as farmers' commitment to quality requirements. Farmers' strategies related to the share of products sold by cooperatives and to individually use the brand also determine their engagement in a brand development scheme. Research limitations/implications - Future research should distinguish producers according to the marketing channel they choose and their industry, and explore the intentions of intermediate marketers. Practical implications - Marketing cooperatives should undertake initiatives to develop local brands effectively, taking into consideration the factors that impact farmers' engagement, while food marketing firms should properly adapt their purchasing and promotion strategies. Public authorities should formulate a policy mix that enhances farmers' knowledge related to marketing issues and encourages farmers to strengthen their positions in the marketplace.

A set of both closed and open-ended questionnaires was used to collect data on agribusinesses. The results from the study revealed that primary production was creating more employment opportunities as compared to agro-processing. However, gross margin analysis showed that the mean gross margin was higher in agro-processing when compared with primary production businesses. The main constraints facing agribusinesses were: lack of working capital, lack of management skills, and marketing related problems. Financial support and skills training were identified as necessary strategies to overcome lack of working capital, management skills, while the problem of marketing could be solved by the creation of a marketing co-operative in the area. The study findings revealed that performance of agribusinesses depended on the management style, capital invested, final product produced, income generated and employment generated.

Cocoa (Theobroma cacao Linn.) production remains one of the main cash crops in Cameroon with over 90% of households in the cocoa producing areas depending on it for their income. Cameroon ranks fifth in the world in cocoa production which has a significant contribution to her economy. This important sector is exposed to climate-related shocks requiring mitigation and adaptation strategies. From an economic perspective, climate-insurance has been suggested as one of the solutions to this problem, as an option to reduce farmers' vulnerability. However, there is little or no information on farmers' preparedness and willingness to pay for climate -related insurance. This article therefore seeks to ascertain the level of preparedness of farmers to sue for climate insurance in cocoa producing areas in Cameroon. We randomly selected 10 cocoa farmer cooperatives drawn across the main cocoa producing divisions of the South West Region - a major cocoa producing region in Cameroon. We combine a structured questionnaire survey with focus group discussions to assess cocoa farmers' awareness, knowledge, perception, level of preparedness and challenges to adopting climate insurance. Furthermore, we interview insurance authorities within the region on existing insurance policies. This information is complemented through field observations and review of relevant literature. We employ descriptive and correlation analysis to assess cocoa farmers' perceptions and level of preparedness for climate insurance. We observe that there is a direct statistically significant relationship between farm sizes, level of diversification and awareness, and farmers' preparedness (P <= 0.05). Income levels showed a significant but indirect relationship with level of preparedness. Poverty, uncertainty, and weak institutions operating with policies that do not consider farmers' realities were key challenges to climate-insurance preparedness. Based on the results we recommend that (i) insurance bodies should undertake feasibility study on the possibilities of instituting friendlier policy for farmers, (ii) farmers should sensitized on the relevance of insurance policies to support cocoa farming in the face of climate vagaries, (iii) farmer groups should strengthen cooperative spirit to ease access to pro-poor insurance policies; and (iv) government should work in partnership with insurance bodies to support farmers through more climate-friendly insurance policies which can be accessed by farmers irrespective of their levels of diversification, income and farm sizes.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors influencing the agri-food cooperatives' trade credit operations by measuring their accounts receivable and comparing the results with agri-food investor-owned firms (IOFs). Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply a partial adjustment model (PAM) estimated using a dynamic panel model with a two-step general method of moments (GMM) estimator to a sample of 11,930 Spanish agri-food cooperatives and IOFs for the period 2011-2018. Findings - The study concludes that cooperatives and IOFs have an accounts receivable target, which they attempt to achieve rapidly. Cooperatives tend to behave as IOFs do, but they present lower adjustment coefficients. This difference seems to be explained by the unique characteristics of cooperatives which set different economic and social goals, not just profit maximization as IOFs. The findings show differences between the financial and commercial purposes of the cooperatives and IOFs as a result of their internal management policies. Larger cooperatives with access to external financial sources, positive cash flows and operational necessities will grant trade credit. Originality/value - This study gives interesting implications for cooperative managers and policymakers to help them to understand the strategies behind trade credit policies. Previous empirical studies on the agri-food sector are scarce and focus on IOFs without considering the role of trade credit in European cooperatives.","[Martinez-Victoria, Mcarmen] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Almeria, Spain; [Mate-Sanchez-Val, Mariluz] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ Accounting & Finance, Cartagena, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Martínez-Victoria, M (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Almeria, Spain.",mcmvic@ual.es,"Mate, Mariluz/H-2131-2015","Mate, Mariluz/0000-0002-9805-6365; Martinez-Victoria, MCarmen/0000-0003-3964-2759","Fundacion Seneca, Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia [19884/GERM/15]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [PID2019-107800GB-I00]","Fundacion Seneca, Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government)","Mariluz Mate-Sanchez-Val acknowledges the financial support received from Fundacion Seneca, Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia, Contract no 19884/GERM/15 and Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion PID2019-107800GB-I00.",,88,2,2,4,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

This structure enables the manufacturers to reach multiple segments of consumers with different online and offline shopping preferences, but it may create channel conflicts due to the manufacturers' competitive position in the end market. Cooperative advertising programs can be implemented in response to the emerging competitive dynamics between the manufacturers and the retailers. We investigate the impact of the consumers' sales channel preference (i.e., consumer loyalty) and the product compatibility with online shopping (i.e., product web compatibility or web fit) on the cooperative advertising and pricing decisions of a manufacturer and a retailer in a dual-channel supply chain. We use game-theoretical models and characterize the firms' equilibrium behaviors under different power structures in the channel. Our results indicate that the level of the retailer's advertising investment and the manufacturer's reimbursement in the cooperative advertising program depend critically on consumer loyalty, product web compatibility, and the power distribution among the channel members. For example, when the channel power is symmetrically distributed or held asymmetrically by the retailer, the retailer's local advertising level increases as the product web compatibility decreases or the proportion of store-loyal consumers increases; whereas this trend is reversed when the manufacturer is the channel leader. We examine how the introduction of the direct channel affects the profits, and we generate additional managerial insights from numerical experiments.","[Chaab, Jafar] Gerad, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Chaab, Jafar] HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Demirag, Ozgun Caliskan] Penn State Univ, Behrend Coll, Black Sch Business, Erie, PA 16563 USA",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Demirag, OC (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Behrend Coll, Black Sch Business, Erie, PA 16563 USA.",ozc1@psu.edu,,,,,,,48,2,2,10,23,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0399-0559,2804-7303,,RAIRO-OPER RES,Rairo-Oper.

Results from a qualitative study of managers and professionals across a variety of industries suggest that voice to targets at different formal power levels (peers or superiors) and locations in the organization (inside or outside a focal unit) differs systematically in terms of its usefulness in generating actions to a unit's benefit on the issues raised and in the likely information value of the ideas expressed. We then theorize how distinct voice flows should be differentially related to unit performance based on these core characteristics and test our hypotheses using time-lagged field data from 801 employees and their managers in 93 units across nine North American credit unions. Results demonstrate that voice flows are positively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at the focal leader of that unitwho should be able to take actionwhether from that leader's own subordinates or those in other units, and negatively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at coworkers who have little power to effect change. Together, these studies provide a structural framework for studying the nature and impact of multiple voice flows, some along formal reporting lines and others that reflect the informal communication structure within organizations. This research demonstrates that understanding the potential performance benefits and costs of voice for leaders and their units requires attention to the structure and complexity of multiple voice flows rather than to an undifferentiated amount of voice.","[Detert, James R.] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Burris, Ethan R.; Harrison, David A.] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Martin, Sean R.] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Cornell University,"Detert, JR (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jrd239@cornell.edu; ethan.burris@mccombs.utexas.edu; drdaveharrison@mail.utexas.edu; srm238@cornell.edu,"Burris, Ethan R/A-7783-2009; Harrison, David A/G-3342-2012","Harrison, David A/0000-0001-5247-3633",,,,,130,160,166,12,268,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0001-8392,1930-3815,,ADMIN SCI QUART,Adm.

To explain the participation in this form of arrangements, the bulk of the literature has focused on firm-level characteristics. In this paper, we assess the role that the territorial dimension, in terms of social capital and geographical remoteness, plays in the explaining Italian firms' participation to Network Contracts (NC). NC have been institutionalized in Italy in 2009 to provide a legal framework for the formation of a wide range of hybrids, encompassing both vertical and horizontal coordination. Data on the population of NCs are aggregated at the municipality level and analyzed through a zero-hurdle model, that properly addresses skewed data with many zeros and admits different underlying processes to explain the zero values. Results show that the territorial dimension plays a major role in explaining the participation to NCs. Proxied through a synthetic indicator, the social capital is strongly significant and negatively related to the number of NC members at the municipality level. However, such a relation proves to be more complicated when different dimensions of social capital are taken into account and when trying to disentangle its effect on horizontal and vertical NC. With respect to geography, remoteness seems to hinder the formation of NCs, as the more peripheral a given municipality, the lower the number of participants. NCs seems to be a legal framework that is able to overcome the constraint to coordination set by the lack of social capital, but it does not show to overcome the problem related to remoteness.","[Pagliacci, Francesco] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Terr & Sistemi Agroforestali TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Zavalloni, Matteo; Viaggi, Davide] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci DISTAL, Viale Fanin 50, I-40127 Bologna, BO, Italy; [Raggi, Meri] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy",University of Padua; University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Zavalloni, M (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci DISTAL, Viale Fanin 50, I-40127 Bologna, BO, Italy.",francesco.pagliacci@unipd.it; matteo.zavalloni@unibo.it; meri.raggi@unibo.it; davide.viaggi@unibo.it,"Zavalloni, Matteo/M-4023-2016; Raggi, Meri/D-1260-2011; Viaggi, Davide/A-3223-2009","Zavalloni, Matteo/0000-0002-6291-7653; Raggi, Meri/0000-0001-6960-1099; Viaggi, Davide/0000-0001-9503-2977; PAGLIACCI, Francesco/0000-0002-3667-7115",,,,,66,6,6,0,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

This study aims to explore the effect of multilingualism on employee ability to adjust to workplace changes based on the concept that multilinguals have been found to switch between tasks more efficiently as compared to monolinguals. Design/methodology/approach Applying a sequential explanatory mixed methods research approach, quantitative performance evaluation data on 207 credit union employees is analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling to predict employee performance, and thematic analysis of qualitative data representing the adjustment narratives of six monolingual and six multilingual employees within the sample is conducted, corresponding to the period during which employees were adjusting to broad workplace changes after the onset of the global pandemic. Findings The results suggest greater predicted improvement in the performance of multilingual employees. Reliance on the task-switching ability associated with multilingualism is found to be the primary self-evaluative factor for successful change adjustment among multilingual employees. Practical implications In light of work performance benefits identified in this study, organizations may consider multilingualism as a characteristic preceding better adjustment to organizational change, and not simply as a skill applicable to tasks requiring language proficiency, suggesting practical implications for human resource and organizational management.

J,"Hatanaka, M",,,,"Hatanaka, Maki",,,"Beyond consuming ethically? Food citizens, governance, and sustainability",JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CONSUMPTION; DEMOCRACY,"To improve the sustainability of food and agriculture, analyses are increasingly calling for forms of engagement by consumers that go beyond voting with their dollars, and for people to be food citizens. While the notion of food citizenship suggests innovative ways that consumers can contribute to sustainable transitions, there is a dearth of research on what it means for a person to act as a food citizen and the kinds of governance processes that enable food citizenship. Using a case study of a consumer cooperative, Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative, in Japan, this paper examines how consumers and producers act as food citizens, and the ways that governance processes affect food citizenship. Three sets of analyses are presented. First, the aspects of Seikatsu Club's governance system that promote and facilitate food citizenship are analyzed. Second, what it means to be food citizens and the kinds of activities consumers and producers partake in as food citizens are examined. Third, the ways that food citizenship impacts consumer-producer relations and sustainability are discussed. Specifically, the analysis of Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative indicates that food citizenship can facilitate mutual understanding and partnership between consumers and producers, and a sense of ownership by them over the food system and sustainability. In concluding, the implications of the findings on Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative for governance, food citizenship, and sustainability more generally are discussed.","[Hatanaka, Maki] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Sociol, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Hatanaka, M (corresponding author), Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Sociol, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA.",maki.hatanaka@shsu.edu,,,,,,,39,17,18,1,18,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,,,J RURAL STUD,J.

The theoretical results reveal that an optimum combination of investment in Sharia'h-compliant securities and permissible lending in response to relative changes in expected average return of securities, lending rate and deposit rate. Counter-intuitively, the Islamic banks do not tend to change the optimum combination of loans and securities due to increase in risk unless it is massive and persistent springing from deep negative economic shocks. The findings of this paper have potential policy implications for Islamic banks and other business entities. As for policy implications, they should i) maintain balanced portfolio with moderate risk exposure, as applicable; ii) keep buffer capital higher than the minimum required to withstand unforeseen financial turmoil; iii) carefully assess costs and benefits of each permissible project; iv) monitor customer profiles to assess individual situations; v) recognize common bond; vi) balance member benefits for neutrality; vii) be transparent and ethical in dealing with clients; and viii) operate according to financial capacities.

Measuring solvency risk by the nonperforming loans (NPL) ratio we find that several factors driving the bank NPL ratio play a more subdued role for MFIs. By contrast, MFI Z-scores, notably those of MFI banks, credit unions and other MFIs, are driven by largely the same factors as bank Z-scores. The difference in results can be linked to the special characteristics of credit technologies pursued by MFIs. Given that the Z-score is the broader risk measure we conclude from our results that larger and deposit taking MFIs should be subject to the same regulatory and supervisory regimes as banks.

By eliminating an outside residual claimant with control over the firm, these alternatives to investor ownership reduce the incentive of the firm to offer such terms. However, customers who are unaware of their behavioral biases may fail to recognize this advantage of non-investor-owned firms. We present evidence from the consumer financial services market that supports our theory. Comparing contract terms, we find that mutually owned firms offer lower penalties, such as default interest rates, and higher up-front prices, such as introductory interest rates, than do investor-owned firms. However, consumers most vulnerable to these penalties are no more likely to use mutually owned firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our model provides a reason why Coops are less prone than PMFs to pay variable bonuses to their managers. We show that this occurs under price competition when in equilibrium the Coop prefers to pay a flat wage to its manager relying instead on her intrinsic motivation, whereas the profit-maximizing rival adopts a variable, high-powered incentive scheme. The main rationale is that, by recruiting a manager whose preferences are aligned with the company goals (e.g., a consumer-owner), the Coop is per se highly expansionary in term of output. Therefore, the Coop does not need to rely on an externally hired manager who sets prices aggressively to expand market share and quantity. Furthermore, adopting a monetary reward based on sales and profits leads to distorted incentives with respect to the Coop's goal, which after all is the welfare of its members.","[Kopel, Michael] Graz Univ, Dept Org & Econ Inst, Graz, Austria; [Marini, Marco A.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Marini, Marco A.] CREI, Rome, Italy",University of Graz; Sapienza University Rome,"Marini, MA (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",michael.kopel@uni-graz.at; marini@dis.uniroma1.it,"Kopel, Michael/AAF-1301-2020; Marini, Marco/P-7052-2019","Marini, Marco/0000-0002-7452-614X",,,,,82,16,16,0,21,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Joint marketing through cooperatives is a potential tool to mitigate these disadvantages; yet cooperatives' success in these settings is uneven at best. We develop an analytical model to study a farmer's choice of selling to a private trader who pays cash on delivery but may exercise market power or a cooperative that promises a price premium but delays payment and carries a concomitant risk of default. In the presence of impatient and risk-averse farmers, we show that these factors can severely limit smallholder patronage of a cooperative, despite a promised price premium. We then construct and parameterize a simulation model to fit a profile of heterogeneous farmers within a prototype developing-country village, and study the optimal decisions of farmers regarding marketing through a cooperative versus a private trader. Results suggest that modest improvements in either timeliness of payment or probability of default can induce a substantial increase in a cooperative's market share and economic viability. Extending the simulation analysis to a dynamic setting shows how implementing reasonable policies to improve a cooperative's payment timeliness and default probability can markedly improve its growth trajectory.","[Saitone, Tina L.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Malan, Benoit] Univ FHB Abidjan, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Sexton, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,66,13,13,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The main idea is that individuals who are both conscientious and identified with shareholders are those most likely to adopt monitoring behaviors. Research Findings/InsightsThe study was conducted using a survey of 166 board members of a large Canadian credit union corporation. Data on monitoring behaviors were collected directly from the chairpersons of the boards they participate in. The results validate the hypothesized moderated mediation model in which perceived importance of monitoring by board members mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and actual monitoring behaviors, on the one hand, and identification with shareholders moderates the relationship between conscientiousness and the perception of the importance of monitoring, on the other hand. Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsBy investigating the mediating effect of the perceived importance of the monitoring role in the relationship between conscientiousness and monitoring behaviors, our study provides an empirical test of the attention-based view in the context of boards of directors and thus contributes to opening the black box' of board behaviors. Further, by looking at the interactive effect of conscientiousness and identification with shareholders, our study brings new insights into the motivational drivers of directors' monitoring behaviors. Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsThis study invites practitioners in charge of board members' recruitment and selection to reconsider their practices in order to target individuals demonstrating high levels of conscientiousness. It also highlights the importance of implementing board cultures that value conscientiousness and emphasize shareholders' interests.","[Guerrero, Sylvie; Lapalme, Marie-Eve; Seguin, Michel] Univ Quebec, Montreal ESG, HRO Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Herrbach, Olivier] IAE Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Guerrero, S (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, ESG, HRO Dept, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",guerrero.sylvie@uqam.ca,,,,,,,69,13,14,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-8410,1467-8683,,CORP GOV-OXFORD,Corp.

We argue that, in their enthusiasm for facilitating IS innovation, the leadership of the movement neglected more deep-seated organisational issues that were, to that point, largely unarticulated. In an attempt to get to the heart of these issues, we synthesise a distinctive theoretical perspective that draws mainly on institutional theory. This helps untangle the complex institutional heritage of the credit union movement, which resulted in the emergence of an interesting hybridity of institutional logics and latent contradictions. These contradictions provoked the emergence of a particular kind of institutional entrepreneurship, which was deeply implicated in reshaping institutionalised ways of thinking and doing. We emphasise the political nature of the change process and argue that the institutional arrangements for governing the ISIS project, which also underpinned the governance of the broader movement, were not well suited to manage the risk associated with such an enterprise. We conclude by suggesting that the case described might be an example of the workings of a broader kind of change dynamics around ICT. Specifically, the scale and scope of the change project acted as a trigger that brought tensions underlying existing competing institutional logics to a head, thus provoking institutional reform.","[Mangan, Anita] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Quinn Sch, CITO, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Mangan, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Quinn Sch, CITO, Dublin 4, Ireland.",Anita.Mangan@ucd.ie,"mchugh, fearghal/D-1070-2012","Mangan, Anita/0000-0002-3366-7536",,,,,69,15,15,0,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-085X,1476-9344,,EUR J INFORM SYST,Eur.

Method: A descriptive quantitative research (911 individuals) was applied, using structural equation and cross-sectional modeling, with an instrument based on Dessler (2006), Lings and Greenley (2005), Tortosa, Moliner and Sanchez (2009) and Park and Tran (2018). Originality/Relevance: The study of specific aspects of Internal Marketing (communication, leadership and information systems) is new in the context of Marketing. Previous work has focused especially in communication, as it already satisfies the most visible need for Marketing activities in organizations. Results: The results indicated that there is an effective contribution of internal communication to organizational objectives, and that the process of communication and leadership play a key role in these objectives.

It draws on a community study conducted in a former coal-mining town in the United Kingdom. The policy background is the UK's Digital by Default agenda, which seeks to make online services the primary form of service access and transaction. In the context of a digitally organized society, a person's status is created through his or her ability to provide certain status markers to authenticate who they are. Status is created through a person's file, and those lacking an online profile become thin-filed and therefore excluded from many online services. The article argues that digital authentication is a feature of the formation of status in a digitally organized society. Without online system files, individuals lack the power to access public services, banks, credit unions, and e-commerce, and they feel a lack of social honor because of their low authentication status.","Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Wessels, B (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",b.wessels@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,8,8,0,15,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

An analysis is carried out of the strategic plans of such retailers, as well as recent developments in the sector. We begin by identifying the priority actions of retailers and then evaluating, by means of a survey, how small horticultural marketing firms (mainly cooperatives) in southeast Spain respond to the needs of these retailers. Subsequently, an analysis is carried out on these small marketing firm exporters to identify the relative weight which they assign to the variables assessed, while also considering the existing relationships between said weighted variables and business profits. Our results show that retailers tend to establish more simplified supply chains (that is, shorter and more vertical), essentially demonstrating their interpretation of a sustainable supply chain. In contrast, horticultural marketing firms have concentrated more on tactical and operational issues, thereby neglecting environmental, social and logistics management. Thus, their success rate in meeting the sustainability demands of their customers can be considered medium-low, requiring a more proactive attitude. Improved and collaborative relations, and the integration of sustainability concepts between suppliers (marketing firms) and their clients could contribute to successfully meeting sustainability demands. From the point of view of the consumer, close supplier-retail relationships have solved food safety issues, but the implementation of sustainability in other supply chain activities and processes is a pending issue. We propose strategic approximation and collaboration to bridge the gap between the varying sustainability demands in the supplier-retail relationship within perishable supply chains. Although this article specifically addresses fresh vegetable supply chains, the results may be extrapolated to other agri-food chains with a similar structure.","[Carlos Perez-Mesa, Juan; Carmen Garcia-Barranco, Ma] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Mediterranean Res Ctr Econ & Sustainable Dev, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CIMEDES,ceiA3, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Piedra-Munoz, Laura] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Mediterranean Res Ctr Econ & Sustainable Dev, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CIMEDES,ceiA3,CEMy, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Giagnocavo, Cynthia] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Res Ctr Intens Mediterranean Agrosyst & Agrifood, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CIAMBITAL,ceiA3, Almeria 04120, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Pérez-Mesa, JC (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Mediterranean Res Ctr Econ & Sustainable Dev, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CIMEDES,ceiA3, Almeria 04120, Spain.",juancarl@ual.es,"Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014; Giagnocavo, Cynthia/AAA-8983-2019; Piedra-Muñoz, Laura/J-9422-2017","Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475; Giagnocavo, Cynthia/0000-0001-9349-9581; Piedra-Muñoz, Laura/0000-0002-5281-698X",Spanish MCINN; FEDER [ECO2017-82347-P]; European Commission (EMME project) [AMIF/2017/AG/INTE/821726]; European Commission (IoF2020 project) [731884]; European Commission (NEFERTITI project) [772705]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [731884] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,Spanish MCINN(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); European Commission (EMME project); European Commission (IoF2020 project); European Commission (NEFERTITI project); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020),"This research was partially funded by Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid (project ECO2017-82347-P), and the European Commission (EMME project, AMIF/2017/AG/INTE/821726, and IoF2020 project no. 731884 and NEFERTITI project No. 772705).",,75,23,23,6,60,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL 2,2019,11,14,,,,,,,3885,10.3390/su11143885,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11143885,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IS6KX,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000482261800130,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because of incomplete contracts and relationship-specific investments, client organisations may face switching costs, which in some cases may be large enough to render vendor switching an unattractive option. Based on an extensive review of the literature, we develop hypotheses about relationship-, firm-, and market-specific determinants of switching costs. We then develop an econometric model to identify those determinants and their relative importance and estimate the magnitude of switching costs. In the empirical study, we observe accounting data of 1318 US credit unions (CUs) and follow their IT outsourcing choices over 11 years. We find that the largest portion of switching costs is due to relationship- and firm-specific factors, while market-specific variables are much less important. Our estimates suggest that average switching costs account for one-third of the average annual expenditure for professional services. We further highlight that the average hides substantial heterogeneity. Switching costs of CUs that decide to switch vendors are about 50% lower than those of CUs that stay. Looking more closely at stayers, our most conservative estimate of the lock-in effect, i.e., the difference in switching costs of deliberate and non-deliberate stayers, is equivalent to about 70% of the average annual expenditure for professional services.","[Peukert, Christian] Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Peukert, C (corresponding author), Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",christian.peukert@ucp.pt,,"Peukert, Christian/0000-0003-3997-8850","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/GES/00407/2013, FCT-PTDC/EGE-OGE/27968/2017]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/GES/00407/2013] Funding Source: FCT",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work was supported by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/GES/00407/2013] and [FCT-PTDC/EGE-OGE/27968/2017].,,71,1,1,1,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-085X,1476-9344,,EUR J INFORM SYST,Eur.

Design/methodology/approach - Oliver proposed an innovative framework to explain the relationships between satisfaction, loyalty, fortitude, and a sense of community. Findings - Analysis of questionnaire responses of 493 customers of banks and credit unions indicated that satisfaction, cognitive, affective, conative, and action loyalty are positively related to fortitude. Research limitations/implications - The Beyond Loyalty Model (BLM) does not address important strategic issues often associated with loyalty, such as firm profitability, complaint resolution, and firm profitability. Practical implications - This research is the first to find that customers of financial institutions acquire satisfaction and strong loyalty ties with their bank or credit union after dealing with their financial services provider for a relatively short period of time. Thus financial institutions should consistently seek relationship-building opportunities from the outset of their relationships with their customers. Originality/value - The resulting Beyond Loyalty Model (BLM) improves upon the American Bankers Association's ABA Financial Client Satisfaction Index, and is a means by which financial institutions can monitor and enhance the satisfaction, loyalty, and fortitude of the customers of financial institutions. Further, the increasing acceptance of virtual banking calls for additional study of this area.","[Fraering, Martin] Univ Evansville, Schroeder Family Sch Business Adm, Evansville, IN 47722 USA; [Minor, Michael S.] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Coll Business, Edinburg, TX 78541 USA",University of Evansville; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Fraering, M (corresponding author), Univ Evansville, Schroeder Family Sch Business Adm, Evansville, IN 47722 USA.",mf53@evansville.edu,,,,,,,89,73,74,12,136,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0887-6045,,,J SERV MARK,J.

For the most part, many users of forest commons extract forest products, typically non-timber products, for subsistence use or safety net purposes. To overcome this problem, in recent years, collective vertical integration (VI) of forest product marketing cooperative structures have been promoted and, in some cases, adopted by users of forest commons. Although this type of program has been observed to raise smallholder incomes, there is little evidence available on saving/investment responses to such income gains. This paper investigates precautionary saving and investment responses to collective forest product marketing programs among users of forest commons in Ethiopian villages. To identify the causal effects of the program, I applied propensity score matching, difference-in-difference (DID) and change-in-change (CIC) estimators to household survey data collected from randomly selected households in the Gimbo district (south-western Ethiopia). I find strong evidence that participation in the program reduces savings in the form of livestock holdings and that effect is limited to non-poor households. When interpreted in terms of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), the results imply that participants felt the current income gains to be non-transient, which led to reduced precautionary savings and to a gain in consumption/welfare. Moreover, I found that the program has spurred investment in child education and participation in off-farm self-employment. These results point to the importance of the safety net/insurance channel of the program. Overall, the findings underscore the program's potential to raise the standard of living via ancillary mechanisms beyond directly raising income outcome. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although these fish products are being traded informally in West Africa, research on this topic is limited. This study builds on a multi-partner supported 'FishTrade' initiative in Africa to illuminate the volume and value of informal fish trade across the Ghana-Togo-Benin (GTB) borders, and the socio-demographic determinants supporting participation and profitability in this trade. We used a structured survey and focus group interviews to obtain data from women fish traders, who handle the entire fish trade in three major Ghanaian markets where ICBT activities are concentrated. Our results showed ICBT across these borders constitutes significant economic and livelihood potential, estimated at about 6000 MT in volume and US$14 million in market value per annum. Furthermore, socio-demographic factors, such as fish traders' years of experience and membership in an unofficial market cooperative, positively influence participation and profitability, but access to market information negatively affects participation. However, geographical distance, large household size and access to micro-finance negatively affect ICBT profitability. Our findings illuminate that consumers' purchasing power, fish taste and preference, ICBT's economic opportunities and a shared heritage and connection significantly influence this form of trading along the GTB borders. We conclude that ICBT in these small pelagic processed fish represents untapped potential for local livelihood and highlight the need for further research on this topic.","[Ayilu, Raymond K.] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Climate Soc & Environm Res Ctr, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Nyiawung, Richard A.] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Nyiawung, Richard A.] Univ Guelph, Guelph Inst Int Dev, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Technology Sydney; University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Ayilu, RK (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Climate Soc & Environm Res Ctr, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",rkayilu@gmail.com; rnyiawun@uoguelph.ca,,"Ayilu, Raymond K/0000-0001-5256-0171",CAUL; European Union,CAUL; European Union(European Union (EU)),"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions These study design and data collection were undertaken as part of the European Union-funded Fish Trade Programme in Africa implemented through the WorldFish, Lusaka Zambia office.

The ruling party (the Republican Peoples' Party) mobilized the cooperative societies to avert the subversive effects of the Great Depression. Besides their economic significance, cooperative societies were formulated as alternative communication channels between the ruler and the ruled. It is argued that under the single party regime the RPP generated a regimented public sphere over these organizations to forward its messages to the masses. The periodicals published by the Turkish Cooperatives Society, the national federation of the cooperatives, provide invaluable insights into the catalyzer role of the bureaucratic intelligentsia in the construction and deconstruction of this public sphere. It is suggested that the interactions between the ruling authority and the bureaucratic intelligentsia generate a certain pattern of political culture displaying the dialectical forces immanent to any public sphere.","[Vardagli, Emine Tutku] Istanbul Aydin Univ, Foreign Trade Dept, Besyol M Inonu C 38 Kucukcekmece, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Aydin University,"Vardagli, ET (corresponding author), Istanbul Aydin Univ, Foreign Trade Dept, Besyol M Inonu C 38 Kucukcekmece, Istanbul, Turkey.",etutkuvardagli@aydin.edu.tr,,,,,,,86,0,0,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-3849,1743-9663,,TURK STUD,Turk.

In the drylands, it is further complicated by weather-related risks and resource degradation. In this paper, we present a case study of the mixed crop-livestock production system in Jordan. To better capture the nature of response farming in the drylands, we develop a methodology for using crop simulation models to directly generate data for optimizing production practices of an integrated crop-livestock producing household in a dynamic stochastic context. The approach optimizes producer's adaptations to random events, such as weather, which are realized throughout the planning horizon. To ensure the sustainability of the optimized production decisions, long-term valuations of end of horizon soil attributes are included in the objective function. This approach endogenizes the tradeoff between short-and long-run productivity. Model results show that due to the limited natural resource endowments and financial liquidity constraints of the typical farm households in the study area, we find these households have limited options. To optimally respond to weather conditions during the production season, better manage risk, and achieve improvements in soil attributes, a typical household would need larger farm size, larger flock, and better financial liquidity than it currently commands. Like all such models, the farm household model used in this paper is not suitable for drawing policy implications. Therefore, targeted analysis using appropriate sectoral or economy-wide models will be needed in the future to identify and test the efficacy of different policy and institutional interventions including land consolidation, establishment of producer and marketing cooperatives, access to financial services including agricultural credit, and crop insurance in expanding the resource base of farmers-thereby positioning them for higher earnings, ensuring soil conservation, and enhancing the sustainability of the production system.","[Boussios, David; Preckel, Paul V.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Yigezu, Yigezu A.; Dixit, Prakash; Rekik, Mourad; Hilali, Muhi El Dine; Wamatu, Jane; Haile, Aynalem] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Cairo, Egypt; [Dixit, Prakash] Net Zero & Resilient Farming, Rothamsted Res, Harpenden, England; [Shakhatreh, Yahya] Natl Agr Res Ctr NARC, Amman, Jordan; [Shakhatreh, Yahya] Arab Atom Energy Agcy AAEA, Life Sci & Environm Dept, Tunis, Tunisia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research,"Yigezu, YA (corresponding author), Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Cairo, Egypt.",Y.Yigezu@cgiar.org,"Dixit, Prakash/AEM-1416-2022","Dixit, Prakash/0000-0003-0957-2972",CGIAR Research Programs on Wheat (CRP-WHEAT); Dryland Systems (CRP-DS) through the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas; [14044242],CGIAR Research Programs on Wheat (CRP-WHEAT); Dryland Systems (CRP-DS) through the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas;,Partial funding for this work came from the CGIAR Research Programs on Wheat (CRP-WHEAT) and Dryland Systems (CRP-DS) through the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Grant Number 14044242).,,39,0,0,3,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Building on previous studies exploring the link between worker subjectivity and workplace change, the paper highlights both the spatial and temporal dimensions of tactics of resistance. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on case study evidence from an Australian credit union that had implemented significant changes to its service strategy, and identifies employee responses to these changes. Findings - The case study identifies the way in which tradition and place can be discursive resources with which employees resist changes to work practices and roles which threaten to disrupt workplace and gender identities. Originality/value - To date, the literature has focused on tactics of resistance that draw on temporal and spatial narratives from inside the organization.

We use the case study method, in-depth interviews and informal talks to gather information from the women dairy farmers. We propose that dairy farmers under NDP-I have improved their socio-economic conditions, and dairy farming has increased the intra-household bargaining power of the farmer women. This article examines the role of the DCSs in improving the socio-economic status of weaker sections, including women and lower-caste people (Bihar, India). We find that social inclusion has been a regular practice at the DCS level, promoting a diversified social relationship among rural women. The findings highlight the process of change that has enhanced women's agency to decide and act upon them at both the household and community level.

The data were collected from randomly selected 200 farmers from four blocks of Ludhiana and Patiala districts where paddy is a major kharif crop which requires adequate doses of urea for its growth. The results of the study revealed that the consumption/sale of urea in Punjab during the year 2007-08 was 2646.44 th. MT which rose to 3086.05 th. MT during the period 2007-08 to 2015-16 at an annual growth rate of 1.64 percent. The urea prices increased significantly at the highest growth of 5.21 percent per annum during the decade 1990-91 to 1999-2000 while during the period 1980-81 to 2015-16 the growth in urea prices was 3.33 percent per annum. The analysis of the primary data revealed that the majority of the respondent farmers purchased NCU and Normal urea (NU) from co-operative societies followed by private fertilizer dealers while the cost per bag of NCU, including transportation cost, worked out to be '289.69 while it was '276.58 per bag in case of NU. There was marginal increase in the productivity of paddy crop during the year 2015-16 as compared to the year 2014-15. The net returns per acre were estimated to be '31401 during the year 2015-16 and '29530 in 2014-15. As far as awareness about NCU was concerned, almost all the selected farmers were aware about the NCU and major source of awareness was co-operative societies. There was a significant increase in the application of NCU after 2015-16 in crops such as; paddy, wheat, basmati, sugarcane, potato, maize, sunflower, and vegetables. Due to the application of NCU, only 5.29 percent farmers reported about the increase in paddy yield while the cost of pest and disease control declined by 21 percent. There was increase in productivity of paddy crop where neem coated urea (NCU) was applied on the sample farms. Also, the NCU usage on the sample farms increased while cost of pest and disease control measures declined. The partial budgeting technique brought out that there were added returns of '718 per acre by application of NCU on the sample farms. It was also revealed by all the respondents that there was no change in the texture of the soil, soil moisture retention capacity, water infiltration rate, soil softness and decline in the compaction of the soil due to application of NCU but there was higher retention of nitrate in the soil and thereby its slow release to the crop. Also, the NCU usage on the sample farms increased while cost of pest and disease control measures declined. High price of NCU, inadequate/shortage of supply during peak season and poor quality of NCU in some of the co-operative societies were the major problems reported by the respondents.

It becomes urgent to ensure the quality (guarantee), integrity, safety, diversity, and relevant information (service) of agricultural products. Consumers' consumption ideas and habits have been largely changed. The marketing principles simply stressing on quality and price satisfaction could no longer satisfy customers' requirements. The circulation and supply processes of agricultural products therefore should be controlled to ensure the excellent quality. The agricultural product supply chain management is relatively important. Taking Nanping City Supply and Marketing Cooperatives as the research sample, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to evaluate the efficiency in this study. The variable data are acquired from open statistical data. The research results are summarized as below. 1. One DMU presents strong execution efficiency on agricultural product supply chain, showing the better agricultural product supply chain; 4 DMUs reveal the agricultural product supply chain execution efficiency in 0.9 similar to 1, showing that the agricultural product supply chain execution efficiency could be easily promoted; 5 DMUs appear the agricultural product supply chain efficiency lower than 0.9, which is obvious inefficient. 2. Sensitivity analysis is used for finding out key factors in the execution of agricultural product supply chain in order to understand the sensitivity to efficiency. The sensitivity factors contain production cost, labor cost, response efficiency, and profit. Finally, suggestions are proposed according to the results. It is expected to enhance the quality, logistic, and information system of agricultural product supply chain, during the integration and innovation of agricultural product supply chain, for the coordination and integration to more effectively execute the frequent transaction.","[Su, Zhifang; Xie, Jieren] Huaqiao Univ Quanzhou, Sch Econ & Finance, Econ, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Qifang] Huaqiao Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University; Huaqiao University,"Xie, JE (corresponding author), Huaqiao Univ Quanzhou, Sch Econ & Finance, Econ, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China.",suzufine@hqu.edu.cn; lqf19861103@163.com; denisxies@gmail.com,"?, ?/HGC-6534-2022",,,,,,24,2,2,1,35,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2019,15,1,,,,,314,327,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,HR3FO,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000463022400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a time-varying probability regime-switching model and monthly data (2000M9-2012M3), we identify two very distinctive regimes: a low mark-up regime (R-1) and a high mark-up regime (R-2). Without setting any given date a priori, the results from both the regime-switching approach and a sequential search method indicate that the spread exhibits a significant upward shift around early 2008 for all lenders. The estimated switching model controls for the rising wholesale funding costs and changes in global consumer confidence over the sample period. The results show that building societies are generally less inclined to remain in R2 than most banks (particularly foreign subsidiary banks) and some credit unions, and are consequently more likely to offer competitive mortgages to borrowers.

They are usually medium to large-scale companies competing with the profit-maximizing firms in the retail sector. This paper describes this situation as a mixed oligopoly in which consumer cooperatives maximize the utility of consumer-members and, in return, refund them with a share of the profits corresponding to the ratio of their individual spending to the cooperative's total sales. We show that when consumers possess quasi-linear preferences over a bundle of symmetrically differentiated goods, and companies operate using a linear technology, the presence of consumer cooperatives positively affects total industry output, as well as welfare. The effect of cooperatives on welfare proves to be even more significant when goods are either complements or highly differentiated, and when competition is a la Cournot rather than a la Bertrand.","[Marini, Marco A.] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Econ Soc & Polit, I-60129 Urbino, Italy; [Marini, Marco A.] Univ Roma III, CREI, Rome, Italy; [Zevi, Alberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Sci Comunicaz, I-00198 Rome, Italy",University of Urbino; Roma Tre University; Sapienza University Rome,"Marini, MA (corresponding author), Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Econ Soc & Polit, Via Saffi 42, I-60129 Urbino, Italy.",marco.marini@uniurb.it; alberto.zevi@uniroma1.it,"Marini, Marco/P-7052-2019","Marini, Marco/0000-0002-7452-614X",,,,,47,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Many MFIs target women because more women than men are poor, especially in rural areas. Studies show that women manage money differently from men and have different leadership styles. Thus, in credit unions and financial firms, female and male managers achieve different results. In microfinance, gender diversity on the board of MFIs is beneficial, and loans authorized by female loan officers have lower default rates. Motivated by these findings, we ask whether MFIs with a female Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are more efficient at serving the poor without jeopardizing financial sustainability. We adapt the banking approach to managerial (in)efficiency to account for the outreach and sustainability goals of the MFIs, and evaluate whether MFIs' outreach efficiency differs by the gender of their respective CEOs. We estimate a stochastic frontier cost function using the Battese-Coelli (1995) model and the true random effects estimators using panel data from over 250 MFIs. We find that MFIs with female CEOs have significantly higher outreach efficiency than MFIs with male CEOs. Similar results are found with a two-step stochastic frontier approach. Overall, the results suggest that promoting gender diversity at the top levels of MFI management is likely to have both social and financial benefits.","[Hartarska, Valentina; Nadolnyak, Denis] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Mersland, Roy] Univ Adger, Kristiansand, Norway",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Agder,"Hartarska, V (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",hartarska@auburn.edu,,"Mersland, Roy/0000-0002-6683-2737",,,,,74,32,32,3,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The size of the ownership body and the value of the land were evaluated as factors affecting dissolution decisions. It was found that in agreement with Olson's theory, the number of members of the body had a statistically significant positive relationship with the life (between formation and dissolution) of the co-operative body. In addition, it was also found that factors that affected the opportunity cost of maintaining status quo, including the value of the land on which the co-op scheme sits and the real option value of redevelopment, had a significant impact on the timing of the dissolution of the co-op.

It focuses on the motivations of consumers to financially contribute to a cooperative by examining the risks and benefits associated with the investment. Based on a survey of 759 consumers, it links their motivations for joining a cooperative to different forms of risks and benefits associated with the investment. It shows that the risks related to cost sharing and switching costs are important determinants for consumers. Other factors that affected the likelihood of joining a cooperative were expected benefits with respect to user network externalities and infrastructure gains. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In order to scrutinise this assumption, this article proposes a set of concepts to study the dynamics of transformative social innovation and underlying processes of multi-actor (dis)empowerment. First, the concept of transformative social innovation is unpacked by proposing four foundational concepts to help distinguish between different pertinent 'shades' of change and innovation: 1) social innovation, (2) system innovation, (3) game-changers, and (4) narratives of change. These concepts, invoking insights from transitions studies and social innovations literature, are used to construct a conceptual account of how trans formative social innovation emerges as a co-evolutionary interaction between diverse shades of change and innovation. Second, the paper critically discusses the dialectic nature of multi-actor (dis)empowerment that underlies such processes of change and innovation. The paper then demonstrates how the conceptualisations are applied to three empirical case-studies of transformative social innovation: Impact Hub, Time Banks and Credit Unions. In the conclusion we synthesise how the concepts and the empirical examples help to understand contemporary shifts in societal power relations and the changing role of the welfare state.","[Avelino, Flor; Wittmayer, Julia M.] Erasmus Univ, DRIFT, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Pel, Bonno; Bauler, Tom] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Weaver, Paul; Kemp, Rene] Univ Maastricht, ICIS, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Dumitru, Adina] Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain; [Haxeltine, Alex; O'Riordan, Tim] Univ East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Jorgensen, Michael S.] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; [Ruijsink, Saskia] Erasmus Univ, IHS, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Maastricht University; Universidade da Coruna; University of East Anglia; Aalborg University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Avelino, F (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, DRIFT, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",avelino@drift.eur.nl; wittmayer@drift.eur.nl; bonno.pel@ulb.be; pweaver@noos.fr; adina.dumitru@udc.es; alex.haxeltine@uea.ac.uk; r.kemp@maastrichtuniversity.nl; msjo@plan.aau.dk; tbauler@ulb.be; ruijsink@ihs.nl; t.oriordan@uea.ac.uk,"Dumitru, Adina/ITU-5179-2023; Weaver, Paul m/D-5972-2011; Pel, Bonno/ABF-5605-2020","Dumitru, Adina/0000-0002-6841-8820; Weaver, Paul m/0000-0002-1905-4477; Pel, Bonno/0000-0001-6863-2475; Jorgensen, Michael Sogaard/0000-0001-6646-7250; Wittmayer, Julia M/0000-0002-4738-6276; Avelino, Flor/0000-0002-3709-9791",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [613169],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),This article is based on research carried out as part of the Transformative Social Innovation Theory (TRANSIT) project which is funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under grant agreement 613169.

While the paper argues that marketing the co-operatives in terms of their community links and democratic structure was important to their success over many years, it was not sufficient to ensure survival. Co-operatives found it necessary to highlight their competitive prices and the quality of their goods. They were vulnerable to changes in the rural economy that led to a decline in the local population. Their survival also depended on the quality of their management, with poor investment decisions and recruitment practices undermining profitability. Generous credit policies also undermined the co-operatives financially.

They have a long history, and an evolving and interesting future. The case of China is perhaps particularly significant, as the co-operatives there are operating still within the context of state control, and it is not clear how they might develop in the future. Were China to decide that the co-operative and mutual corporate form had an important role to play alongside state, personal and shareholder-ownership models, then given the significant role of China in the global economy, this could have a major impact on the type of corporate diversity the world's economy enjoys in future years.

However, critics have exposed certifications' inability to secure independence, quality, consumer trust, and costs. Recent criticism is even more pointed in that some theorists have critiqued alternative systems such as Fair Trade as neoliberal window-dressing. What is curious about this emerging literature is how little has been said about the role of citizens. Although most of the certification literature has assumed that food certification resides in the exclusive realm of experts and that technical sophistication is equated with improvement, I argue that democratization is possible and desirable. This paper draws on a case study of a Japanese consumer cooperative which has conducted a laywomen's food certification system for past ten years. By proposing at least two parameters of evaluation of food certification-redistributive effect and the degree of democratization, the paper expands the imaginary of politics of the possible in food governance while acknowledging tension of gendered participation.

They wither when the institutions that permit this weaken or vanish. Sacrifice zones ? abandoned, economically shattered places, with growing social and health problems ? are spreading in historically white rural areas and small towns across the United States. Rural decline, rooted in economic restructuring and financialization, causes severe stress, exacerbates racial resentment, and creates a breeding ground for regressive authoritarian politics. A multidimensional approach must analytically connect long-term and recent trends affecting economy and livelihoods, institutions, health, and community life. The ?racial resentment? and ?economic distress? explanations for authoritarian populism are inextricably connected. Since the 1980s, and in intensified form after the 2008 financial crisis, capital has systematically undermined the institutions ? mutually-owned banks, credit unions, mom-and-pop businesses, family farms ? that fostered reinvestment of locally-produced wealth, especially but not only in rural areas. While many Trump voters were affluent suburbanites, another important sector of supporters consists of downwardly mobile inhabitants of zones where financialization and austerity destroyed the institutions that earlier allowed people to appropriate the wealth that they produced and where the social safety net, always fragile, is increasingly in tatters. The United States now has a poor and near-poor majority. Scholars and the media have underestimated the human toll of this crisis and the interconnectedness of the multiple processes of social decomposition affecting rural zones.","[Edelman, Marc] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Anthropol, 695 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Edelman, Marc] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Anthropol, 695 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Edelman, M (corresponding author), CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Anthropol, 695 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.;Edelman, M (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Anthropol, 695 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",medelman@hunter.cuny.edu,,,,,,,202,48,48,5,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

The results also indicate that inefficiency in urban developed councils is largely the result of congestion and other collection difficulties encountered in densely populated areas while inefficiency in regional and rural councils stems from an inability to attain an optimal scale of operations.","Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; Univ New England, Sch Econ Studies, Armidale, NSW, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of New England,"Worthington, AC (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",,,"Dollery, Brian/0000-0003-2760-865X; Worthington, Andrew/0000-0003-4113-9036",,,,,46,93,95,5,35,POLICY STUDIES ORGANIZATION,URBANA,"UNIV ILLINOIS 361 LINCOLN HALL, URBANA, IL 61801 USA",0190-292X,,,POLICY STUD J,Policy Stud.

A crucial differentiator between the beef sector and the dairy sector, which has higher farm incomes, is well-developed infrastructure of farmer-owned dairy processing and marketing co-operatives. To address the lack of representative farmer organisations and power imbalances in the beef supply chain, in 2016 the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM) legislated for the establishment of beef Producer Organisations (POs), facilitating beef producers to collectively strengthen their market positioning. While PO legislation is a significant development in potentially enabling supply chain integration of farmers, how the legislation is operationalised by Irish beef industry stakeholders will ultimately shape the nature and breadth of engagement with the PO model and, consequently, the impact of the legislation. In a context where there is little or no prior experience of such organisations in the beef sector, this paper presents an analysis of current stakeholder views in relation to the establishment of POs. Research involved a desk based review of the submissions made during the consultation period for the beef PO legislation and interviews with key informants in the Irish beef industry. We analysed Irish stakeholders' views through the lens of lessons learned from the existing literature on how POs operate internationally. Results indicate some stakeholders' perceptions of the need for a nationally coordinated approach in the establishment of an Association of POs, which concurs with the literature. However, stakeholders have not emphasised the benefits of Interbranch Organisations (IBOs), which involve vertical collaboration with other chain actors such as processors and retailers, an approach that has proven successful internationally. Nor have Irish stakeholders identified the potential of differentiating or premiumising beef products, which, according to international evidence, is necessary for improving profitability and farm-level incomes. Stakeholders identified the main threats to the future success of POs in Ireland as members' lack of commitment and processors' lack of willingness to engage with POs.","[Teresa, Hooks; Aine, Macken-Walsh; Olive, McCarthy] TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Mellows Campus, Galway H65R718, Ireland; [Teresa, Hooks; Olive, McCarthy; Carol, Power] Univ Coll, Ctr Cooperat Studies, ORahilly Bldg, Cork T12 CY82, Ireland; [Teresa, Hooks; Olive, McCarthy; Carol, Power] Univ Coll, Dept Food Business & Dev, ORahilly Bldg, Cork T12 CY82, Ireland; [Maeve, Henchion] TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Dublin D15 KN3K, Ireland",Teagasc; Teagasc,"Aine, MW (corresponding author), TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Mellows Campus, Galway H65R718, Ireland.",teresa.hooks@ucd.ie; aine.mackenwalsh@teagasc.ie; o.mccarthy@ucc.ie; CPower@ucc.ie; Maeve.henchion@teagasc.ie,,"Macken-Walsh, Aine/0000-0001-8803-0674; McCarthy, Olive/0000-0002-2791-5214; Power, Carol/0000-0002-9481-4368; Henchion, Maeve/0000-0001-7842-1516",Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Scheme [00215],Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Scheme,This research was funded by [Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Scheme] grant number [00215].,,73,9,9,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,4085,10.3390/su10114085,0,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC1AQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000451531700259,0

Some of the institutions even connect environmental and sustainability issues with their general business strategies. Compared with other countries, Canadian banks are best in class, as all six Canadian commercial banks, comprising over 90 percent of Canadian assets, systematically examine environmental risks for credits, loans and mortgages. We conclude that Canadian banks are proactive regarding environmental examinations of loans and that there is a need for a more accountancy related reporting on environmental risk management in financial institutions.

Specifically, the effects of numbers of regional bank branches on their credit businesses and profits are empirically examined. The results indicated that regional banks with more branches can increase their loans and bills discounted as well as their small and mid-sized enterprises loans and bills discounted. Thus, establishing more branches is effective in increasing the total sum of loans and bills discounted by each bank because regional banks with many branches can make contact with more customers. On the other hand, return on assets and return on equity of regional banks with more branches were found to be lower. Therefore, regarding the cost performance of regional banks, establishing too many branches and maintaining branch networks that are too large can have negative effects on regional banks.","[Kondo, Kazumine] Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Aichi Gakuin University,"Kondo, K (corresponding author), Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Meijo, Nagoya, Aichi 4628739, Japan.",kondo@dpc.agu.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP15H03366],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP15H03366.,,27,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Design/methodology/approach The study employed a quasi-experimental design. Six SACCOS were purposively selected in four districts of Mwanza and Tabora regions in Tanzania. A sample of 500 respondents was randomly selected of whom 200 were SACCOS' members and 300 were non-members. A questionnaire and a key informant interview guide were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to analyse the quantitative data whereas qualitative data was subjected to thematic analysis. Findings The results indicate that SACCOS' services had significantly impacted on the household livelihood outcomes in terms of maize yields, household assets, savings, food expenditures and non-food expenditures. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted in two regions of Tanzania using six SACCOS. Similar studies can be conducted in a larger area of Tanzania by capturing more than six SACCOS. In addition, the study focused on the rural areas of Tanzania. The future studies can be carried out in urban areas or both urban and rural areas of Tanzania. Practical implications Local leaders, SACCOS' leaders and other stakeholders in the study area should thus mobilise non-members in their areas to join SACCOS. In addition, the Tanzania government should facilitate the formation of new SACCOS and strengthen those already operating in rural areas. Social implications SACCOS provide opportunities for individuals and households in rural areas to converge socially and economically to achieve better results (positive impact on livelihood outcomes), which otherwise could be non-achievable through single household or individual efforts. Originality/value Unlike previous studies, this study provides empirical evidence on the impact of SACCOS' services on livelihood outcomes of SACCOS members in rural areas of Tanzania where abject poverty is widespread and where the majority of SACCOS are found.","[Msuya, Richard Ibrahim] Moshi Cooperat Univ, Dept Cooperat Educ, Moshi, Tanzania; [Kazuzuru, Benedicto] Sokoine Univ Agr, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Mataba, Lucas] Moshi Cooperat Univ, Moshi, Tanzania; [Kessy, Severine Sirito Augustine] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture; University of Dar es Salaam,"Msuya, RI (corresponding author), Moshi Cooperat Univ, Dept Cooperat Educ, Moshi, Tanzania.",halleluyarichard@gmail.com; kazuzurub@gmail.com; lmataba@yahoo.com; severine.kessy@gmail.com,,"Kessy, Severine Sirito Augustine/0000-0002-6286-8556; Msuya, Richard/0000-0002-4398-7066",,,,,59,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0306-8293,1758-6712,,INT J SOC ECON,Int.

Method: This is a quantitative study, conducted as a survey with a sample of 57 credit cooperatives. The data was analyzed through Structural equation modeling, with partial least square estimation on SmartPLS 3.0 software. The strategic risk and strategic uncertainty constructs were analyzed in relation to their connection with Simons' Levers of Control (1995), which contemplates the beliefs and boundary controls and interactive and diagnostic control systems. Furthermore, the connections between the four Levers of Control are also analyzed. Originality/Relevance: The study covers the antecedents (strategic risks and uncertainties) of MCS use, contemplating different compositions of type and class in credit cooperatives, taking previous studies into consideration, as well as covering a singular and pertinent region in the context of Brazilian credit cooperatives. Results: Strategic risk is not associated with the use of the Management Control System. Strategic uncertainty was proven to be the element that receives the most importance from managers in the process of using the four Levers of Control. Regarding the beliefs system construct, its importance is positively linked to the interactive control system, as also occurs with the connection between the interactive control system and the diagnostic control system. Theoretical/Methodological contributions: The study demonstrates the pertinence of the Levers of Control for credit cooperatives, inserted in the context of strategic risks and uncertainties. Social/management contributions: The findings bring about relevant contributions by proving that the balanced use of the four Levers of Control is relevant for promoting the strategic renovation of credit cooperatives, especially regarding strategic uncertainty.","[Frare, Anderson Betti] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Horz, Vagner; Quintana, Alexandre Costa; Capuano da Cruz, Ana Paula] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande,"Frare, AB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",anderson_betti_frare@hotmail.com; vagnerhorz@gmail.com; professorquintana@hotmail.com; anapaulacapuanocruz@gmail.com,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,1,"UNIV BRASILIA, BUS ADM DEPT",BRASILIA,"CAMPUS DARCY RIBEIRO, BRASILIA, DF 70910-90, BRAZIL",1984-3925,,,CONTAB GEST GOV,Contab.

Drawing primarily from status characteristics and network position theories, the authors propose and find in a study of 693 employees from 89 different credit union units that supervisors are more likely to credit those reporting the same amount of voice if the employees have higher ascribed or assigned (by the organization) status-cued by demographic variables such as majority ethnicity and full-time work hours. Further, supervisors are more likely to recognize voice from employees who have higher achieved status-cued by their centrality in informal social structures. The authors also find that even when certain groups of lower status employees speak up more, they cannot compensate for the negative effect of their demographic membership on voice recognition by their boss. The authors underscore how recognition of employee voice by supervisors matters for employees. It carries (mediates) the effects of voice expression and status onto performance evaluations 1 year later, which means that demographic differences in the assignment of credit for voice can serve as an implicit pathway for discrimination.","[Howell, Taeya M.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Harrison, David A.; Burris, Ethan R.] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Dept Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Detert, James R.] Cornell Univ, Samuel Curtis Johnson Grad Sch Management, Dept Management & Org, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",New York University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Cornell University,"Howell, TM (corresponding author), NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, 40 West Fourth St,Tisch Hall,7-01A, New York, NY 10012 USA.",thowell@stern.nyu.edu,"Harrison, David A/G-3342-2012; Burris, Ethan R/A-7783-2009","Harrison, David A/0000-0001-5247-3633; Howell, Taeya/0000-0002-5278-2628",,,,,127,91,100,7,164,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0021-9010,1939-1854,,J APPL PSYCHOL,J.

Focusing on the 'contact zone' allows us to better understand the everyday organizing that produces hybridity. We build on existing work on hybridities in organizations which predominately focus on issues of language and knowledge by focusing on the organizational interactions themselves, especially the embedded interactions between humans and objects.

By re-framing governors as meta-regulators, regulatory institutions would acquire new powers to steer FTs towards sustainable forms of compliance via non-coercive, non-intrusive means.","[Wright, John S.

This article argues that the dividend, though important, was only one aspect of financial assistance co-operative retail societies offered their members. By focusing on the period of the 1920s-40s, it explores how collective strength and mutual aid provided by societies extended to financial support during periods of economic crisis and industrial action. Credit in times of need was especially important for members of societies affected by trade depression, industrial crisis and unemployment during the interwar years. The article also argues that membership could give access to much wider support than is typically associated with the retail aspect of co-operative societies. For example, societies assisted individual members, or the families of members, during periods of illness and death. The article highlights how, as trading organisations, the spirit of mutual help within co-operative retail societies incorporated an element of collective expenditure. In addition to providing support for hospitals located in the communities in which they traded, societies also offered financial aid to nationally recognised charities. In this way financial assistance and support provided through the co-operative business model was not solely focused on extending the purchasing power of individual consumers.","Northumbria Univ, Dept Humanities, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University,"Robertson, N (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Dept Humanities, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",nicole.robertson@northumbria.ac.uk,,,,,,,76,9,9,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-6791,,,BUS HIST,Bus.

However, it is the first to possess all three of these attributes simultaneously. For this reason, the Bristol Pound has been heralded by some as marking a new era for local currency-driven localisation. To explore the Bristol Pound's impact on localisation, 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with businesses and other Bristol Pound stakeholders. Economists were also interviewed to gain insights into the barriers to localisation and the likely impact of a CLC on these barriers. Overall, our findings suggest that the Bristol Pound is not driving localisation. Many of the key barriers were found to be political/institutional in nature (e.g. support for free trade, the free movement of capital, the power of global corporations, and the expansionary logic of capitalism). Such barriers are unlikely to be influenced by a CLC. We therefore suggest that those pursuing localisation should engage in a more active agenda that aims to change government policy and institutions to support an equitable, sustainable economy.","[Marshall, Adam P.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [O'Neill, Daniel W.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Leeds,"Marshall, AP (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",a.marshall@mmu.ac.uk,"O'Neill, Daniel W./AGZ-3370-2022","O'Neill, Daniel W./0000-0002-0790-8295; Marshall, Adam P./0000-0002-8364-2281",,,,,42,20,20,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

From the Gamma Rationality Measure for the credit unions sector that comprises 67% of Kenyan economic livelihoods and using a combination of econometric and Riemann double integral methods, the income consumption rationality function is derived, from which a Cogni-economic Pressure Coefficient is generated for each income level.

Female African lions demonstrate a unique form of plural breeding in which companions consistently produce similar numbers of surviving offspring. Consistent with theoretical predictions from models of reproductive skew, female lions are unable to control each other's reproduction because of high costs of fighting and low access to each other's newborn cubs. A female also tacks incentives to reduce her companions' reproduction, because her own survival and reproduction depend on group territoriality and synchronous breeding. Consequently, female relationships are highly symmetrical, and female lions are free agents who only contribute to communal care when they have cubs of their own.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Packer, C (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",,,"Pusey, Anne/0000-0002-2280-8954; Eberly, Lynn/0000-0003-4763-330X",,,,,45,148,149,2,102,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,,,SCIENCE,Science,JUL 27,2001,293,5530,,,,,690,693,,10.1126/science.1062320,0,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,458PW,11474110,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000170204600053,0

Although SACCOs form the majority of microfinance providers in many developing countries, the most recent literature on microfinance governance and performance has given little reference to the longstanding body of relevant cooperative literature. SACCO representation in microfinance datasets is biased. Drawing on so-far unexploited datasets of Ugandan SACCOs and savings groups, this paper empirically analyses policy debate regarding SACCO- and savings group regulation. The findings point to the relevance of practically implementing the principle of cooperation between cooperatives' to ensure effective governance at SACCO level. Moreover, the paper introduces two new measures, based on members' savings and shares, which could become useful tools to track the application of cooperative principles in developing countries, and hence improve evidence-based policy-making for SACCOs.","[Schmidt, Oliver] Mt Moon Univ, Ft Portal, Uganda",,"Schmidt, O (corresponding author), Mt Moon Univ, Ft Portal, Uganda.",oliver.schmidt@mmu.ac.ug,,"Schmidt, Oliver/0000-0003-4746-2221",,,,,59,3,3,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Existing studies show the positive effects of rural reforms, however, whether the rural credit cooperative's shareholding reform promotes rural economic development and whether effects are exerted through the synergism between agricultural producers and rural financial institutions remain unclear yet. Employing the rationale of isomorphic incentive compatibility from system science, we analyze the necessity and influencing conduit of rural credit cooperative's shareholding reform theoretically. Analysis shows that only the financial services from rural commercial banks can promote the modernized production, and thus the synergism between them drives rural economic development. Then we make empirical analysis on the effect with a Chinese provincial sample. Comparing to provinces with lower reform progress, the provinces with greater reform progress are influenced more prominently by this reform. Applying coupling coordination degree model, the coordination between agricultural production and rural banking development shows obvious increase, especially after the formal implementation of shareholding reform on rural credit cooperative. Empirical results indicate that this synergism plays positive roles in promoting agricultural growth and reducing the urban-rural income gap. In addition, these effects are more pronounced after the formal implementation of shareholding reform.","[Hu, Yue; Lu, Siwei; Zhang, Huiyuan; Liu, Guibo; Peng, Jiangang] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410079, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Peng, JG (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410079, Peoples R China.",yuehumail@hnu.edu.cn; lusiwei429@hnu.edu.cn; zhanghuiyuan@hnu.edu.cn; liuguibo@hnu.edu.cn; pengjiangang@139.com,,,Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province [17YBA087],Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province,This research was funded by the Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province (17YBA087).,,97,1,1,7,62,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2021,13,5,,,,,,,2844,10.3390/su13052844,0,,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QW4SI,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000628640800001,0

In Indian context, to empower women and enable political participation, 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) was introduced. Subsequently, many women entered politics. Though widespread proxy is reported, still a small proportion engages effectively in governmental participation (Hust, 2002; Mathew, 2003; Palanithurai, 2001). Studies also find female Dalit-headed panchayats are more active (Jayshree, 2010; Kalaiselvi, 2012). As the cultural norms, traditions and patriarchy are rigid, the paper attempts to examine what helps the women to be functional? Does social networks differ? Is there a link between social capital, by way of associationalism, and capacity for self governance as suggested by Putnam (1993) in the Indian context? Social capital is understood through social networks and membership in associations. Thirty-eight elected representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions of southern Tamil Nadu, south India was interviewed in depth. Active members prominently belong to Dalit community and the social network of the elected active members is larger in size, heterogeneous in terms of age, gender and caste composition, and they are anchors themselves. They are primarily embedded in a web of political, caste and self-help group associations and have access to all women police stations, cooperative societies and political parties through family ties. The elected representative's mandatory membership in district Dalit federations provides safety-net in dealing with discrimination and atrocities while also intervening at the village-level panchayat.

One major decision taken by the European Commission was to transition the powers of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors to that of the European Banking Authority (EBA). Our analysis focuses primarily on the differing behaviour by each European country's banking sector to major shocks, namely that in the form of bank closures. It is then necessary to investigate and further understand the role that the European Banking Authority now possesses with regards to releasing sensitive announcements based on the underlying currents of the European Banking system as measured by domestic banking sector stock returns. Finally, we investigate the cultural characteristics that can be uncovered by analysing the responses of domestic banking sectors to uniform regulation. We present three key findings. First, European countries with more local banking networks in the form of credit unions, public banks or savings banks, generate greater levels of volatility when compared to that of their commercial counterparts, particularly in countries with more monopolistic sectors. Secondly, the announcements of the European Banking Authority generate significant volatility effects for the European banking sector at large, with particular emphasis on stress testing results, but also announcements based on recapitalisation, regulation and transparency. Finally, cultural distance effects are identified, indicating that peripheral states are experiencing more substantial volatility effects to European Banking Authority decisions. These results indicate that uniformity of regulation may in fact be hindering and restricting the growth of some domestic and more peripheral and locally designed banking sectors in the form of rules designed for commercial banking operations.

Data were collected from a maguey pulquero cooperative society through the use of a strategic planning and investment instrument. The commercial diagnostic phases, market research and products portfolio design were considered. To obtain information for the portfolio, a productive chain analysis was conducted, considering productive links, post-harvest management and commercialisation. Market research was done in two important market centres in influential regions, where knowledge and frequency of consumption of maguey pulquero products was identified. The Boston Consulting Group Matrix was used to integrate the portfolio's products and by-products, and the Ansoff Matrix was employed to determine the product's positioning. Finally, an investment and economic viability analysis of the products portfolio was carried out. Six products were identified, with pulque and agave syrup being the investment priority products owing to the profits they generate. Penca, ixtle and paper generate complementary income. The strategies for pulque and agave syrup are market penetration, and the strategies for the remaining products are market and product development. The analysis of products include positive-tonet present value, investment return rate and cost benefit ratio.","[del Rosario Villavicencio-Gutierrez, Maria; Ernesto Martnez-Castaneda, Francisco; Roberto Martinez-Campos, Angel] Autonomous Univ State Mexico, Livestock & Agr Sci Inst, Toluca, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico,"Martnez-Castañeda, FE (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ State Mexico, Livestock & Agr Sci Inst, Toluca, Mexico.",femartinezc@uaemex.mx,"Campos, Angel Roberto maca Martínez/B-1597-2016; Martinez-Castañeda, Francisco Ernesto/A-9888-2016","Campos, Angel Roberto maca Martínez/0000-0003-4729-3413; Martinez-Castañeda, Francisco Ernesto/0000-0003-0168-921X; Villavicencio-Gutierrez, Maria del Rosario/0000-0002-8869-5892",CONACyT [570063],CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"To the producers for their cooperation and availability.

According to EY experts, most operations in the banking sector, such as payments and transfers, financing and capital management will be carried out using innovative approaches and technologies. This makes the development and management of the innovation process in Russian banks relevant. For the successful development and application of the innovation process in Russian banks, it is necessary to determine the development directions of the innovation process in the Russian banking sector. In order to determine the priority directions of development, it is advisable to divide financial organizations into groups depending on indicators reflecting the efficiency of their business activities. According to the results of the assessment, the existing set of global financial organizations was divided into 4 groups like the BCG matrix. On the basis of the analysis conducted, conclusions were made about the directions of innovative development for each of the groups.","[Kurilov, K.] Toglyatti State Univ, Belorusskaya St, Tolyatti 445667, Russia; [Bogatyrev, D.] Samara Univ, Ak Pavlova St 1, Samara 43011, Russia; [Zabolotny, G.] Samara State Tech Univ, Molodogvardeyskaya St,Bldg 244, Samara 443100, Russia",Samara State Technical University,"Kurilov, K (corresponding author), Toglyatti State Univ, Belorusskaya St, Tolyatti 445667, Russia.",KY.Kurilov@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-929-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2020,128,,,,,,1155,1161,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BS2HM,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000701397801045,0

This facility is called a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). For operation and maintenance of CETP, small scale tanners formed a co-operative society. The expenses for operation and maintenance of CETP are being shared by participating tanneries. Wastewater management for the cluster of small scale tanneries was studied in details and various measures were incorporated to improve performance of the CETP and also to improve treated effluent quality to confirm standard prescribed by regulatory agencies. Performance of existing CETP was evaluated. Based on the results, bench scale laboratory treatability studies were conducted for improvement in treated effluent quality and also to suggest appropriate modifications to the CETP.

Second, it aims to evaluate the relations between HRM practices, employees' perception of a co-operative difference, and their organizational commitment through the influence of some socio-demographic variables. The main findings are that: (1) the employees perceived a co-operative difference through HRM practices that influenced their commitment; (2) the more the employees had work experience, the more they perceived a co-operative difference, and the more they displayed affective and normative commitment; (3) the higher the hierarchical status of the employees, the less they displayed calculative commitment; (4) the employees with union membership displayed lower affective and normative commitment.","[Marcoux, Gilles; Guihur, Izold; Leclerc, Andre] Univ Moncton, Res Grp Management Cooperat, Moncton, NB, Canada",University of Moncton,"Marcoux, G (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Res Grp Management Cooperat, Moncton, NB, Canada.",gilles.marcoux@umoncton.ca,,,,,,,74,1,2,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-5192,1466-4399,,INT J HUM RESOUR MAN,Int.

The school, prior to its conversion to an academy, was well known in the local area for its commitment to social justice principles. Drawing on interview data collected from senior administrators, teachers, governors and students in the school, this paper seeks to understand why a school with a commitment to social justice would go down the academy route given the social justice concerns raised by such a move. This paper also considers if becoming a co-operative academy presents an ironic opportunity to resist many of the current regressive educational trends epitomised by academisation.

A revival of ambition to transform African agriculture has reawakened debate over what type of agriculture can best deliver increased production and poverty reduction for rural populations. This paper examines these debates through the lens of an ethnographic study of an irrigated rice farm in Tanzania. With a chequered history of state and donor intervention management, Dakawa, Rice Farm in Mvomero District is now collectively farmed by a cooperative society of 'small farmers'. It is widely hailed as a success, both of irrigation production, and of 'small farmers' in delivering this. However, such narratives of smallness and success obscure a more complex reality in which smallness of scale may be more of a discursive tool than a reflection of empirical reality. Although notions of 'viability' and 'success' in such development interventions are themselves also contested and depend on perspective, there is evidence that there are fundamental problems of both short- and long-term viability.","Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; Univ Leeds, Sch Polit Int Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Harrison, Elizabeth] Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Mdee, Anna] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sussex; University of Leeds; University of Sussex; University of Leeds,"Harrison, E (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",e.a.harrison@sussex.ac.uk; a.l.mdee@leeds.ac.uk,,"Mdee, Anna/0000-0002-8260-1840",DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme [EJ/JOO9415/1]; ESRC [ES/J009415/1] Funding Source: UKRI,DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article is based on research funded by the DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme, grant reference EJ/JOO9415/1.

However, there is limited information on their current status and the key factors driving their operations in the country. This paper sought to address this informational gap by reviewing the existing literature in the country from the theoretical background of sustainable development and later validating the obtained findings with the current state of knowledge at regional and global levels. Results from document content analysis indicate that there are over 10,000 tree growing farmers organized into planting groups across the country after many years of piloting by the government and private sector players. At the national level, there are two associations. These include Kenya Forest Growers Association (KEFGA), mainly composed of large scale planters, and Farm Forestry Smallholder Producers Association of Kenya (FFSPAK), targeting small-holders. Besides these two, six major sub-national associations are seeking to improve members' welfare by enhancing the acquisition of livelihood assets. Further, various socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect their operations in Kenya. These associations have deployed multiple strategies to benefit their members. However, the formation of savings and credit cooperative societies (SACCOs) seems to be their preferred mode of community empowerment. In conclusion, even though these associations are still at the infancy stage, their future remains promising in-view of the observed behavioral change in their governance, which appears to favor entrenched equality and equity towards sustainable development.","[Chisika, Sylvester Ngome; Yeom, Chunho] Univ Seoul, Int Sch Urban Sci, Seoul 02504, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Yeom, C (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Int Sch Urban Sci, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",sylvesterchisika@uos.ac.kr; chunhoy7@uos.ac.kr,,"Yeom, Chunho/0000-0002-4382-5323",,,,,26,2,2,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,10,,,,,,,4013,10.3390/su12104013,0,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC6VG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000543421400071,0

The credit cooperatives filled an important gap and provided short-term credits for the rising number of Jewish self-employed in a more and more hostile surrounding in a country basically stripped of reserves. While the one cooperative went down in a crash in 1937, the other cooperative did business right until the pogrom if November 1938-which marked the beginning of the end of all commercial activity in Germany for Jews.","[Kreutzmueller, Christoph] Jewish Museum Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Kreutzmueller, Christoph] House Wannsee Conf, Berlin, Germany",,"Kreutzmüller, C (corresponding author), Jewish Museum Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,54,2,2,0,4,PURDUE UNIV PRESS,W LAFAYETTE,"1207 SOUTH CAMPUS COURTS-E, W LAFAYETTE, IN 47907-1207 USA",0882-8539,1534-5165,,SHOFAR,Shofar,WIN,2017,35,2,,,,,1,19,,,,,,19,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,FE8ZK,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000408493800001,0

We show that Stackelberg private leadership is better from the viewpoint of total social welfare, while Cournot followership is better when the social provisions for the underprivileged are emphasized. We also find that both cost inefficiency and the number of private enterprises affect the profitability and welfare consequences. We then investigate the rationing policy on the production of social enterprise and show that output rationing is superior to market share rationing not only for the social concerns of the underprivileged but also for total social welfare, even though it is less attractive than subsidy policy.

They address the significance of the board of directors. The extant literature has focused on structural factors and performance of the board. Outside directors, board members' education and female representation have been considered essential board characteristics. Consequently the election of board members has become an object of interest. A successful election process is assumed to generate a competent board. Many of the studies discuss the topic in the context of public limited companies. However, cooperative seldom emerge in these studies. This has both academic and practical consequences: the understanding on the cooperative governance does not accumulate and practitioners do not have in-depth knowledge available in order to develop their cooperatives. What make cooperatives different from other firms are a broad member base, customer, worker, and entrepreneur relationships to the cooperative and differences in the governing bodies. These features have special implications on the governances of cooperatives. The purpose of this paper is to gather existing academic knowledge on cooperative governance and to produce an overall review on the governance mechanisms in cooperatives with an emphasis on the election of board members. The goal is to figure out what we know about the governance and the election of board members in cooperatives. The review sheds new light on the academic discussion on cooperative boards, their composition and processes as well as their election. The novelty of the work lies in the diverse approach of cooperative governance. The study shows knowledge gaps in the extant literature of cooperatives and makes suggestions on future research. It builds a framework for future studies in the field of the governance of producer, consumer and worker cooperatives as well as credit unions.

These hypotheses are tested on a sample of Italian conventional and cooperative firms for the Wine Production and Processing sector, using both frontier analysis and dynamic panel techniques. The results support the hypothesis that increasing market pressure can affect positively the cooperatives efficiency, while gains in technical efficiency do not seem to have any impact on the cooperatives' market share.","[Sena, Vania] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7EF, W Midlands, England; [Maietta, Ornella Wanda] Univ Naples Federico 2, DEPA, Naples, Italy",Aston University; University of Naples Federico II,"Sena, V (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7EF, W Midlands, England.",v.sena@aston.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,12,12,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This paper explores the politics that have arisen from changes in the governance framework in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The focus is on the privatisation of the management of city markets and on the relations between the multiple actors involved-private contractors, vendors' associations, cooperatives and state actors. in particular, the paper looks into the implications of the privatisation process for vendors and their associations. It argues that, while the latter have sometimes adjusted to the changes by turning into cooperative societies or creating their own management firms, increasingly, however, private interests external to the markets are taking over the management functions, sidelining or even repressing, vendors' associations. The general picture is one of weakening associations and endangered possibilities for broad-based organising and interest representation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study examines vicarious learning-related communication through which individuals share their observations with other organizational members. Most students and members of present-day organizations would expect that this communication is driven by a prodevelopment logic-that communication serves the purpose of organizational improvement and competitiveness. Our unique historical evidence on learning-related communication over multiple decades shows that the subjective and collective attitude toward prodevelopment communication may be ideologically conditioned. Prodevelopment communication is the norm in capitalist organizations, but competing ideologies may emphasize other goals higher than organizational development. Consequently, increasing challenges to capitalism as the ideological basis of economic organization can have deep impacts on how organizations learn and produce innovations in the future.

Since 2003, sonic mutually-supported financial societies gradually gain the recognition from the government supervision agencies and gain a lawful status. However such cooperative agencies proceed very slowly with a lot of hindrance factors. Comparatively, some cooperative societies simultaneously organized by the peasants and some peasants' financial mutual supporting agencies become active and become an important way to solve temporary financial needs of the farmers in the process of production, which also provide a possible way for the integration of various sources in the countryside. Such modes have achieved success in Japan and Korea, although in China they remain in the state of research.

Design/methodology/approach - Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings - The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications - It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications - The research confirms that individual dairy farmer's loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value - Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province.","[Susanty, Aries; Bakhtiar, Arfan; Muthi, Mustofa] Diponegoro Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Semarang, Indonesia; [Jie, Ferry] Edith Cowan Univ, Commerce Discipline, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, Australia",Diponegoro University; Edith Cowan University,"Susanty, A (corresponding author), Diponegoro Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Semarang, Indonesia.",ariessusanty@gmail.com,"susanty, aries/Q-2267-2015","susanty, aries/0000-0003-0601-5206; Bakhtiar, Arfan/0000-0002-8763-377X; Jie, Ferry/0000-0002-6287-8471",,,,,71,19,19,4,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Financial-institution leaders can play a crucial role in promoting financial literacy with their practical experience and expertise. This article sheds new light on the application of online technology to promote financial literacy by exploring the perceptions of financial-institution leaders. Supported by Dewey's pragmatic constructivist paradigm and the PEST conceptual framework, a qualitative inquiry research through in-depth telephone interviews with 20 leaders from banks and credit unions in Texas was conducted. The findings revealed some common ways to provide online financial literacy education, including website information posting, online financial calculators, external links, social media communication, and partnering with appropriate third parties. The financial leaders perceived that applying online technology would be an enlightening future direction especially for the millennial generation but face-to-face education would remain important. The opportunities included social responsibility fulfillment, corporate image strengthening, marketing, and favorable regulatory consideration. The challenges involved the human and financial resources constraints, IT support, lack of effective evaluation, and how to motivate online learning. Some leaders suggested the use of games, financial incentives, and innovative apps. The policy implications included increase in government support, partnership with schools, embracing financial literacy in the state test, and collaboration among financial leaders, regulators, educators, and policy makers to foster financial literacy for the benefits of the society.","[Lee, Hazel W.] Univ Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ 85040 USA",University of Phoenix,"Lee, HW (corresponding author), Univ Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ 85040 USA.",hwhlee1@email.phoenix.edu,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,,,,,103,2,2,2,12,NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIV,FORT LAUDERDALE-DAVIE,"3301 COLLEGE AVE, FORT LAUDERDALE-DAVIE, FL 33314 USA",1052-0147,2160-3715,,QUAL REP,Qual.

Based on these premises, the article analyses the experience of a 5-year action research project (from 2006 to mid-2011), carried out within Unicoop Tirreno, an Italian consumers' cooperative, and aimed to implement different tools for sustainability accounting and to embrace a more open dialogue with stakeholders, in particular with employees and members. In this process of change, the tools implemented for sustainability accounting played a key role in supporting the cooperative to reinterpret its own values and in stimulating a new and participative management approach.

Research into the Reindeer Herding Industry has been conducted in order to gain information on their management and to develop a socially-oriented strategy conducive to overcoming the accumulated problems. Institutional transformation is a mechanism through which the accumulated problems of herding can be addressed, and the industry can be shifted from a pattern of regression towards evolutionary development. Institutional transformation is based in the ethnic and economic features of the reindeer herding family and ancestral households and directed towards correcting the defects of the legal system and the system of herding management. The conflict between the needs of family and ancestral farms, the resources of the traditional economy, and the established institutions pose challenges - ideological (political), social, economic, and ecological - to the system of management. The organizational model for institutional transformation in the reindeer herding industry is founded on the confirmation of the private farm as the primary legal form of organization for reindeer herding, supplemented by competence centers, reindeer herding parks, the legal, organizational entity of the agricultural consumer cooperative, and novel measures of state support for family and traditional households. These findings indicate a connection between the problems of reindeer herding, indigenous peoples, and national settlements. Accordingly, projects aimed at solving the problems in the spheres of the traditional way of life must function jointly on the social, ecological, and economic levels.

To do so, we look at the credit cooperative banking sector, which often attempts to conduct socially responsible business practices. To deepen our understanding of how such banks deal with risk, we provide an in-depth study of one credit cooperative bank. The analysis highlights the peculiarities of ERM practices implemented in a specific context and explains how an ERM system enables credit cooperative banks to manage the risks associated with a duality of purpose. This research is relevant from a theoretical perspective because it addresses new trends in the risk management literature, thus elucidating how ERM systems can be implemented to support dual-purpose organisations. The study also adds to the literature on ethical banking, as it offers an in-depth description of how ERM systems work in this particular context. This paper also has practical implications; it provides insights to similar banks on how to manage risk in a way that supports social development in their local communities. Our analysis is also of interest to other types of socially-oriented businesses, which may follow a similar approach to operationalise ERM practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

About 80 million rural Indian households are engaged in milk production with a very high proportion being landless, small and marginal farmers. The study aims to analyse the challenges faced by the dairy industry in generating employment and expanding their business. The paper has taken data from annual survey of industries over 20 years and a case study with a detailed interview of a cooperative society working in the dairy sector. The analysis is based on autoregressive distributed lag model. With the help of analysis, the study found that the dairy industry has the potential to generate employment. During the interaction for the case study, it was observed that firms in the dairy industry undertake the production of value-added products to yield profits which is limited due to low investments. However, the lack of advertisements of these products results in restrained sales and limits income of the farmers. Therefore, the study suggests that the private sector should be encouraged through product link incentive scheme and the government should intervene as a facilitator for their growth and expansion on international levels.","[Pingale, Vaibhavi] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Interdisciplinary Sch Sci, Liberal Arts, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India; [Singh, Niharika] Symbiosis Int Univ, Symbiosis Sch Econ, Senapati Bapat Rd, Pune 411004, Maharashtra, India",Savitribai Phule Pune University; Symbiosis International University; Symbiosis School of Economics (SSE),"Pingale, V (corresponding author), Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Interdisciplinary Sch Sci, Liberal Arts, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.",vaipy2702@gmail.com,"Singh, Dr. Niharika/AEV-8805-2022; SINGH, NIHARIKA/GQH-0296-2022","Singh, Dr. Niharika/0000-0002-7178-440X;",,,,,24,0,0,1,3,INDIAN SOC LABOUR ECONOMICS,NEW DELHI,"C/O MNG ED, NIDM BLDG, IIPA CAMPUS, NEW DELHI, INDIA",0971-7927,0019-5308,,INDIAN J LABOUR ECON,Indian J.

The industry has been in existence for over one hundred years but have suffered a stunted development due to neglect by policy makers. Wood carving is an important and long established traditional artifact industry in Ibadan metropolis and Oyo township. The industry has a very rich cultural background that has influenced in no small way, its organization, products and survival. Socio-economic assessment of wood artifact products in Oyo state, Nigeria was carried out with a view to determining the value of the enterprise. Structured questionnaires were administered on the wood carvers. Purposive sampling method was adopted in selecting the respondents. Forty questionnaires were given to wood carvers of which thirty two (80 per cent) were duly filled and returned. The study showed that a large number of people are engaged in the industry which has a high potential for employment and fuller utilization of timber resources. The product quality is greatly affected by the carvers' skills as well as the tree species used. Results showed that the industry is profitable with an average Gross Margin of N333,274.50 and an average Net Return of N328,304.50 annually per enterprise. The wood carving industry is beset with some problems, prominent among these are lack of finance for expansion, narrow market, cultural belief and poor business organization. It is recommended that the carvers must of necessity team up as a cooperative society for a proper development of the industry which in turn would foster government assistance to provide incentives for wood carving industry in Nigeria.","[Faleyimu, O.

Five different indicators of financial development are used: credit to the private sector as a share of GDP, the number of mobile transactions, the value of these mobile transactions, the number of mobile agents, and the number of bank accounts. The results from using an autoregressive distributed lag demonstrate a strong, positive relationship between remittances and financial development in long-run equations. This suggests that higher levels of remittances provide opportunities for recipients to open bank accounts, enhance their savings, and access financial systems, in addition to exposing the previously unbanked to both new and existing financial products. The results also confirm the potential advantage of embracing modern and advanced technology to facilitate international mobile transfers. Using international remittance transfers through mobile technology reduces costs by eliminating the need for physical branches and personnel to attend to walk-in customers. Aside from offering convenience and safety for remittance actors, this method also dominates traditional remittance business models. Therefore, a policy window exists for the government to leverage on remittances as a tool of financial inclusion and depth, and particularly through the continued expansion of regulatory space to accommodate the wider use of international mobile remittance transfer channels. Moreover, given the strong, positive relationship between remittances and credit to the private sector as indicated by its share of GDP and number of bank accounts, commercial banks and other players in the remittance market may also find it useful to develop customized products for migrants to access their remittances. For example, financial intermediaries can consider providing better deposit interest rates for diaspora deposits compared to deposits made in the local currency. Further, these institutions can allow regular remittance flows to act as collateral for the allocation of credit, among other incentives to tap into the significant potential of money remitted by migrants to Kenya. The study also recommends that the government consider expanding exploitation of diaspora bonds and diaspora savings and credit cooperative societies while drawing lessons from other countries' previous attempts.","[Misati, Roseline Nyakerario; Kamau, Anne] Cent Bank Kenya, Res Dept, Nairobi 6000000200, Kenya; [Nassir, Hared] African Inst Remittances, Nairobi 5244800200, Kenya",,"Misati, RN (corresponding author), Cent Bank Kenya, Res Dept, Nairobi 6000000200, Kenya.",rosenyamisa@hotmail.com,"Hadri, Valdet/AAE-5457-2021",,,,,,118,21,21,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2199-4730,,FINANC INNOV,Financ.

Furthermore, federal regulations disincentivize financial institutions from banking and lending to licensed cannabis businesses. The authors explore the impact of legal cannabis business activity on California financial institutions, the barriers to banking faced by cannabis businesses, and the nontraditional sources of financing used by the industry. Design/methodology/approach The authors use a mixed methods approach. The authors utilize call data for banks and credit unions headquartered in California and state cannabis licensing data to estimate the impact of the extensive and intensive margins of licensed cannabis activity on key banking indicators using difference-and-difference and fixed effects regressions. The qualitative data come from interviews with industry stakeholders in northern California's Emerald Triangle and add important context. Findings The quantitative results show economically and statistically significant impacts of licensed cannabis activity on banking indicators, suggesting both direct and spillover effects from cannabis activity to the financial sector. However, cannabis businesses report substantial barriers to accessing basic financial services and credit, leading to nontraditional financing arrangements. Practical implications The results suggest opportunities for cannabis businesses and financial institutions if regulations are eased and important avenues for further study. Originality/value The authors contribute to the nascent literature on cannabis economics and the literature on banking regulation and nontraditional finance.","[Plakias, Zoe; Jodlowski, Margaret] Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Giamo, Taylor; Kavousi, Parisa; Taylor, Keith] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Plakias, Z (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",plakias.2@osu.edu; jodlowski.1@osu.edu; tlgiamo@ucdavis.edu; pkavousi@ucdavis.edu; keitaylor@ucdavis.edu,,"Giamo, Taylor/0000-0001-5104-1046; Kavousi, Parisa/0000-0002-3440-4594; Taylor, Keith/0000-0003-2733-3457; Plakias, Zoe/0000-0002-7721-1055",University of California Davis Cannabis and Hemp Research Center via Research Investments in Cannabis and Hemp (RICH) grant,University of California Davis Cannabis and Hemp Research Center via Research Investments in Cannabis and Hemp (RICH) grant,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to the University of California Davis Cannabis and Hemp Research Center for the funding support via Research Investments in Cannabis and Hemp (RICH) grant (PI: Keith Taylor).

The available data allows one to sustain that the earliest cooperatives, following mutual-aid societies, were mainly created by the craft community, which was making use of cooperation to assure the continuity of ancient practices. The functions fulfilled by the craft guilds, the brotherhoods, the commons and other pre-modem institutions were overtooked by their modern counterparts in a process of institutional adjustment to the new political and legal framework.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the characteristics of savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) that apply for the annual reporting excellence award in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs correlation and probit regression analyses to establish the factors which explain the decision by SACCOs to participate in the Financial Reporting (FIRE) excellence award. The study utilizes data consisting of 1,272 firm-year observations for 212 SACCOs, over the period 2008-2013. Findings - Consistent with institutional and legitimacy theories, the results demonstrate that structural and governance variables are significant and positively associated with the decision to participate in the annual FIRE awards by SACCOs in Kenya. Similarly, larger SACCOs and those that have adopted best cooperative governance practices are more likely to participate in the annual FIRE awards. The results also reveal that SACCOs audited by the Big 4 audit firms are more likely to participate in the annual FIRE awards. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on the factors explaining the decision to participate in the annual reporting excellence awards by organizations in a specific sector. Further studies can adopt a multi-sectoral approach to investigate the same phenomenon. Practical implications - The findings highlight the importance of cooperative governance and resources in explaining why SACCOs choose to participate in the FIRE awards. Originality/value - The study adds onto the dearth of literature on the aspect under focus.

Access to credit positively influenced the TDI adoption in the three milksheds. Adoption of TDI was influenced by hired employees, dairy records, total dairy cows and household head education. The empirical evidence from the study supports the observation that OIDI adoption intensity is influenced by income, farm size, dairy records, and dairy information access. To boost TDI adoption, the dairy development partners should link cooperative society members with agricultural credit lenders. Additionally, the dissemination of dairy information to farmers by the dairy stakeholders could spur TDI adoption, while providing dairy information and training farmers on dairy record keeping should be promoted to boost TDI and OIDI adoption.","[Wairimu, Edith; Mburu, John] Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, POB 29053, Nairobi 00625, Kenya; [Ndambi, Asaah] Wageningen Univ & Res, Anim Sci Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gachuiri, Charles] Univ Nairobi, Dept Anim Sci, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; Wageningen University & Research; Animal Sciences Group of Wageningen UR; University of Nairobi,"Wairimu, E (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, POB 29053, Nairobi 00625, Kenya.;Ndambi, A (corresponding author), POB 338, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands.",edithwairimu@yahoo.com,"Ndambi, Asaah/HKO-2321-2023","Ndambi, Asaah/0000-0001-8563-2805; Gachuiri, Charles/0000-0002-5257-1468; Mburu, John/0000-0001-6762-9979",LEAP-Agri,LEAP-Agri,The research is part of the LEAP-Agri funded Africa-Milk project.

The measures of loans by NTLs (number, use, share and lender type) require the use of Poisson, Probit, Tobit and Multinomial Logit techniques. This study utilizes individual producer data from the 2018 Agricultural Resource Management Survey and 2018 county-level branch density data for FCS, BCU and AFS providers. Findings Access to credit from FCS is helpful to BFRs only, while access to AFS is associated with the use of loans from NTLs by women but not by BFRs. As expected, access to BCU credit matters for the use of loans from NTLs, with a complementary effect for BFRs but a substitution effect for women's use of such loans. Originality/value There are no studies on local agricultural credit markets in the US that evaluate the implications from changes in access to credit on credit-constrained borrowers and their use of NTLs' credit.","[Nadolnyak, Denis; Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Nadolnyak, D (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",nadolda@auburn.edu,,"Nadolnyak, Denis/0000-0003-0961-8141",USDA ERS cooperative agreement [58-600-8-0062],USDA ERS cooperative agreement,This research was funded by the USDA ERS cooperative agreement [Award number: 58-600-8-0062].,,49,1,1,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

The agricultural producers' cooperative game problem in contract farming is formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear program. Using the strong duality theory of stochastic linear programs, we not only prove that the core of agricultural producers' cooperative game is nonempty but also provide a simple way to compute a profit allocation policy in the core. We establish the convexity of agricultural producers' cooperative game so that the game has population monotonicity, which gives agricultural producers an incentive to expand their current coalition. We then analyze the agricultural producers' cooperative game with a concave cost structure, which may exhibit economies of scale for production. Taking advantage of the proposed stochastic duality approach, the agricultural producers' cooperative game with a concave cost structure is also shown to have a nonempty core.","[Shi, Zhanwen] Hunan Univ, Changsha 410079, Peoples R China; [Cao, Erbao] Hunan Prov Key Lab Logist Informat & Simulat Tech, Changsha 410079, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Cao, EB (corresponding author), Hunan Prov Key Lab Logist Informat & Simulat Tech, Changsha 410079, Peoples R China.",caoerbao@hnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71420107027, 71671061]; Outstanding Young Foundation of Hunan Province Natural Science [2018JJ1003]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Outstanding Young Foundation of Hunan Province Natural Science,This research was supported by (i) the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 71420107027 and 71671061; and (ii) the Outstanding Young Foundation of Hunan Province Natural Science under Grant 2018JJ1003.,,60,8,8,4,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The study adopts a social network approach by focusing on two relational social ties: information sharing and advice-seeking. Building on a case of a 55-year-old dairy cooperative in India, the social network analysis finds information-sharing relations among members to be inclusive, with no members isolated, and information exchanged along formal and knowledge hierarchies. Likewise, information sharing is horizontal, with information smoothly exchanged even among new and already established members, as is the transfer of leadership roles from the older members of the cooperatives to the younger members. Advice-seeking networks tend to be a bit more centralized toward board members and members exerting day-to-day leadership because of their knowledge and expertise regarding the organization and its policies. Our analysis suggests inclusive information sharing among members and a well-structured and functioning advice and knowledge-sharing network that contributes to learning of the cooperative members.","[Singh, Shyam] Inst Rural Management Anand IRMA, Anand, Gujarat, India; [Holvoet, Nathalie; Dewachter, Sara] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy, Antwerp, Belgium",Institute of Rural Management Anand; University of Antwerp,"Singh, S (corresponding author), Inst Rural Management Anand IRMA, Anand, Gujarat, India.",shyamready@gmail.com; nathalie.holvoet@uantwerpen.be; sara.dewachter@uantwerpen.be,,"Holvoet, Nathalie/0000-0003-4413-1208","Verghese Kurien Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA), Gujarat, India","Verghese Kurien Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA), Gujarat, India","This work was supported by the Verghese Kurien Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA), Gujarat, India.",,78,4,4,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-297X,2213-2988,,J CO-OP ORGAN MANAG,J.

When behavioural innovativeness is concerned, the socially oriented activities of co-operatives suggest that specific values and behaviours within such organisations may influence their innovativeness. Hence, this research aims at better understanding how this co-operative difference impact on the co-operative innovativeness. In order to answer this objective, the research focused on the particular case of the Federation des caisses populaires acadiennes (FCPA), a Canadian second-level financial service co-operative, and 13 of its credit unions. A questionnaire was administered online to a population of 888 employees, with a response rate of 65.1% (578 respondents). The component analysis of 9 statements on behaviours and values oriented towards innovation and improvement resulted in two factors accounting for a satisfactory 62.5% of the variance. The two factors represented components of the behavioural innovativeness in terms of the supervisor's transformational leadership, and team collaboration. Hypotheses were made suggesting the positive relationship between the two factors and behavioural innovativeness as expressed by the commitment of the employees towards the success of the cooperative and the improved quality of its services. Moreover, it was suggested that a cooperative difference, as perceived by the employees, would positively affect the relationship between the cultural factors and the behavioural innovativeness. Results of the structural analysis of the conceptual framework, using Lisrel 9, showed a significant and positive full mediation of the co-operative difference between the supervisor's transformational leadership and the co-operative behavioural, and a partial mediating role of the co-operative difference between team collaboration and behavioural innovativeness. These results are of interest for cooperative managers. With a focus on specific human resources practices aimed at enhancing an innovative culture at the management and the team levels, they could contribute to build a co-operative difference in the workforce and from these efforts, develop the organisational commitment towards innovation.","[Guihur, Izold; Marcoux, Gilles] Univ Moncton, Adm Dept, Fac Adm, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada; [Leclerc, Andre] Univ Moncton, Dept Human Sci, Edmundston, NB, Canada",University of Moncton; University of Moncton,"Guihur, I (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Adm Dept, Fac Adm, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada.",izold.guihur@umoncton.ca; andre.leclerc@umoncton.ca; gilles.marcoux@umoncton.ca,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-1050,2049-1069,978-1-910309-47-6,PROC EUR CONF ENTREP,,,2014,,,,,,,225,234,,,,,,10,Business; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC2XN,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000351436500027,0

Design/methodology/approach This study uses social network analysis to analyze relational data. Findings The study finds that the members of the dairy cooperative maintain both information sharing networks separately and that each network has different control and efficiency mechanisms.

In mainstream India, males play the major role in weaving while women are involved in pre-weaving activity. In contrast to this, in the north-eastern states of India, especially Manipur, the weaving occupation is dominated by women, who often perform the dual roles of producer and trader. There are no power looms or cloth mills in the state even today, and these women weavers are to be credited for preserving Manipur's heritage by laboriously producing traditional textiles by hand. Globalisation and the opening of global markets may require their skills and knowledge to be upgraded to face the competition, and this study is an attempt to understand the world of the women weavers of Manipur in the context of a changing society. Their integral role in an industrially backward state is reflected in the lives of the 300 women selected for this study, which examines their socioeconomic conditions; the advantages and disadvantages associated with their working conditions; aspects of their health, wages and aspirations; their social relations with family and community; as well as the changing market structure, the technology used and production.

Design/methodology/approach An event study was performed using 240 days pre-event period and an event period that consisted of 25 days pre and 25 days post the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement in Kenya. The difference in differences (DiD) method was also used for cause-effect analysis for two years before and three years after the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement. The outcome variable was firm value, whereas the treatment and control groups were Kenyan listed firms and deposit-taking credit unions, respectively. Findings The event study method found cumulative abnormal returns after the date of the board diversity reforms announcement to be positive and significant. The DiD methods found a positive and significant market reaction to the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement in Kenya. Research limitations/implications This study was limited by the secondary data that was collected and analyzed from financial statements and stock price data from the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). Financial statements have the disadvantage of being affected by the judgment and estimates of their preparers or accountants. Practical implications Emerging markets like the NSE are vulnerable to market manipulation by insiders. Efficient stock markets are known to attract more investors who are interested in a trustworthy stock price determination mechanism. The Capital Market Authority should thus continue implementing corporate governance reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of the NSE and the trustworthiness of stock prices therein. The continued reforms thus imply better value for money for the NSE investors. Originality/value This study makes an important contribution to literature by combining an event study and DiD analysis to assess market reaction to board diversity reform announcements in emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa which is a concept that has not been researched before. Past studies have used event studies to investigate the efficiency status of stock markets in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the current study used an additional method of DiD and hence contributed to literature.","[Ndegwa, James Ndirangu] Cooperat Univ Kenya, Dept Accounting & Finance, Karen, Kenya",Cooperative University of Kenya,"Ndegwa, JN (corresponding author), Cooperat Univ Kenya, Dept Accounting & Finance, Karen, Kenya.",jndegwa@cuk.ac.ke,,,,,,,51,0,0,3,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1472-0701,1758-6054,,CORP GOV-INT J BUS S,Corp.

The per ha total variable cost in basmati DSR was lower ((sic)22032) when compared with TM ((sic)27682) and in non-basmati per ha total variable cost in non-basmati DSR ((sic)22246) was also lower when compared with TM ((sic)29376). The returns per rupee spend on basmati TM was (sic)3.32 against (sic)4.17 in DSR and in non-basmati returns per rupee spend on TM was (sic)3.90 against (sic)5.22 in DSR. In the case of DSR, there was no significant difference in yield between DSR and TM of basmati as well as non-basmati. The study suggested that for faster adoption of DSR, the subsidy should be made hassle-free, the role of extension services need to be strengthened. Custom hiring should be increased through co-operative societies and co-farmers keeping in view the high cost of seed drill.","[Singh, Ajaypal; Grover, D.

This is a particularly challenging problem being faced by the small and marginal farmers in any emerging economy. Farmer collectives (FCs) which are cooperative societies of farmers, launched under Federal Government initiatives in many countries, offer the prospect of enabling cost-effective procurement of inputs with assured quality. We seek, in this work, sound and explainable mechanisms for the above important use-case. In particular, we propose the use of incentive compatible auction mechanisms that could be used by an FC to procure quality inputs in bulk. The idea is the following. An FC collects from the farmers their individual requirements for inputs and aggregates them into different buckets. For each bucket, the FC identifies suppliers who meet the quality criteria and engages them in a competitive procurement auction. We explore in this paper, two particular types of procurement auctions: volume discount auctions and combinatorial auctions in the framework of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms. These are explainable mechanisms that induce truthful bids from the suppliers as well as maximize the social welfare. We show their efficacy through carefully designed thought experiments. Our field studies of FCs give us the confidence that such mechanisms, if deployed systematically, can become a game changer, benefiting a massive community of smallholder farmers.","[Bhardwaj, Mayank Ratan; Fatima, Azal; Enaganti, Inavamsi; Narahari, Y.] Indian Inst Sci, Bengaluru, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Bhardwaj, MR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Bengaluru, India.",mayankb@iisc.ac.in; azalfatima@iisc.ac.in; inavamsie@iisc.ac.in; narahari@iisc.ac.in,,,National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development; Ministry of Education of the Government of India,National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development; Ministry of Education of the Government of India,The authors thank the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development for funding a part of this project.

It attends to situated representational practices in a Swedish consumer cooperative that seeks to strengthen consumer voice in markets. Combining notions of political and symbolic representations, the paper demonstrates the production of spokespersons for the cooperatives' owners who, in turn, work to engage other consumers to voice and enact concerns in the cooperative. Four stages of representational practices are identified: (s)electing, equipping,engaging, and enacting. These practices are conceptualised as part of processes of agencing and concerning: (s)electing and equipping work to arrange consumer agencies, while engaging and enacting refer to ways of concerning others that put agencies into motion. Agencies are proposed as liquid in character and the capacity of consumers to shape markets comes into effect depending upon how agencies continuously become connected to each other.","[Stigzelius, Ingrid] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Mkt & Strategy, Mistra Ctr Sustainable Markets Misum, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Stigzelius, I (corresponding author), Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Mkt & Strategy, Mistra Ctr Sustainable Markets Misum, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",ingrid.stigzelius@hhs.se,,,Swedish Retail and Wholesale Council [2012:389],Swedish Retail and Wholesale Council,The research underpinning this paper was funded by The Swedish Retail and Wholesale Council [grant number 2012:389].,,98,8,8,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1025-3866,1477-223X,,CONSUMP MARK CULT,Consump.

The credit cooperative movement that grew up in Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century had to wrestle with both. These cooperatives thrived, in part, because they adopted strategies first to obtain and then to harness the information they needed about the communities in which they were located, giving them an advantage over other lenders. Particularly effective was the tactic of using local people as managers, which helped to cement their ties with the community. Yet because few, if any, locals had banking experience and most were not even familiar with basic accounting methods, the managers created internal management problems, intensifying outside suspicion of the cooperatives as banking enterprises. The methods the cooperatives developed to overcome these problems drew on a combination of local initiative and regional assistance that was typical of the movement as a whole. The movement's ability to train its own talent suggests that it had a broader impact than has been captured by statistics on its membership or financial assets.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Guinnane, TW (corresponding author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,35,21,21,0,9,HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL,BOSTON,"BUSINESS HISTORY REVIEW, 60 HARVARD WAY, BOSTON, MA 02163 USA",0007-6805,,,BUS HIST REV,Bus.

The revenue model predicts that a government's source of revenue determines whether elites invest in effective bureaucracy and the provision of public goods that benefit wide swaths of society or the extraction of resources from society to benefit a limited network. In this model, a cooperative society with high social capital is an outcome of effective, collective government. The combined model predicts that social capital has a semi-independent causal effect, in addition to revenue, on the inclusiveness of governments. Our results indicate that the combined model of collective governance fits the data on U.S. states better than the revenue model alone. The combined model of governance predicts that revenue and social capital moderate the population size-political complexity relationship, and data from the U.S. states are consistent with these predictions.","[Freeman, Jacob; Owens, Andrew] Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Keith, Jonathan] Utah State Univ, Anthropol & Archaeol Sci Program, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Roberts, Max] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Freeman, J (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Anthropol Program, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, 0730 Old Main, Logan, UT 84321 USA.",jacob.freeman@usu.edu,"Roberts, Max Tyler/GQB-0351-2022","Freeman, Jacob/0000-0001-7402-8450",,,,,30,2,2,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1069-3971,1552-3578,,CROSS-CULT RES,Cross-Cult.

On the socioeconomics characteristics of the artisanal fishermen, it was found that the majority (58%) of the respondents were male with 36% of the respondents having secondary school as their highest level of education. Also 31% have fishing experience of below10 years with yearly fish output of above 1000kg by 31% of the respondents and yearly income of greater than N200,000 by 53% of the respondents while 81% belong to co-operative society. Extension agents have visited none of the respondents. The major environmental factors affecting artisanal fishing in the area were oil spillage (100%), waste disposal (100%) and climatic factors (100%). On the constraints faced, the study found out that militant activities, inadequate finance, oil spillage around depots, and poor sales were found to be serious. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that, the Government and other appropriate authorities should enforce the fishing laws and regulations to avoid illegal exploitation of fishing grounds by trawlers and the destruction of artisanal fishing gears.

This study used the Neo-Institutional theory to interrogate how the rules and regulations (institutions involved) of the agrarian reform process in Kenya are constantly changing and helping to shape the livelihoods of social actors around Mau Forest. The first case study-Ndungulu, is a settlement scheme where the Ogiek ethnic community were resettled between 1995 and 1997 after the land clashes of 1992. The second case study is the Kamuyu cooperative farm, a post-colonial settlement scheme owned by a cooperative society that was founded in 1965 by members from the Kikuyu ethnic group. This study employed qualitative data collection methods intermittently between 2012 and 2017 for a total of two years. A total of 60 interviews were conducted for this research. Thirteen (13) of these were key informant interviews with experts on land. The qualitative interviews were complemented by participant observations and nine focus group discussions. The qualitative data from the interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed, coded and analyzed thematically. Observations documented as field notes were also analyzed to complement the study findings. In this paper, the challenges, bargaining position and power play between social actors and government institutions implicated in the agrarian reform process in Kenya has been brought to the forefront. For instance, due to the structural issues that date back to the colonial period, the Ogiek have found innovative ways to maintain their daily existence (e.g., maintaining traditional methods of apiculture in Mau Forest). However, constraints in accessing forest land has resulted in them taking desperate measures, namely; selling off land to the Kalenjin in what is called distress land sales. On the contrary, the neighboring Kikuyu have maintained their land ownership status despite recurrent ethnic clashes that have occurred during general election years.","[Chabeda-Barthe, Jemaiyo; Haller, Tobias] Univ Bern, Inst Social Anthropol, Lerchenweg 36, CH-3000 Bern 9, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Chabeda-Barthe, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Social Anthropol, Lerchenweg 36, CH-3000 Bern 9, Switzerland.",cjemaiyo@yahoo.com; tobias.haller@anthro.unibe.ch,,,Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Students 2010-2011; Josephine de Karman scholarships (2017),Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Students 2010-2011; Josephine de Karman scholarships (2017),"The first part of this research was supported through the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Students 2010-2011.

Design/methodology/approach - Using both purposive and simple random sampling techniques, the paper selected 120 farm households from the flood prone areas of the state, using the list of the State Agricultural Development Project (ADP) contact farmers as a sampling frame. Data for the paper were collected using a set of structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The information collected included the extent of agricultural losses incurred by the farm households, farm household's level of asset base, flood coping strategies adopted by the farmers and so on. The data were collected in August 2013. Findings - More than 70 per cent of the farmers' farmlands were affected by flood, resulting in more than 80 per cent of their staple crops (cassava, rice, yam, maize and vegetables) and livestock (sheep/goat and chicken) being lost. Women were generally more vulnerable than men to the effect of flood. Selling of assets, borrowing of loans to diversify the means of livelihood, short-term migration, support from social network, compensation of losses from National and/or State Emergency Management Agencies, planting of agro-forestry trees, change of date of planting, land terracing, construction of drainages, cover cropping and making of ridges across slop constituted the flood coping strategies of the farmers. On the factors influencing the choice of these coping strategies, the level of education of the household head, frequency of extension visits in a year and tenure security status were positively and significantly related with land and crop management strategies, such as planting of agro-forestry trees, planting of cover crops and construction of drainages across farmland. Age, access to credit, farm size and membership of cooperative societies had negative relationships with selling of assets and short-term migration. In addition, membership of cooperative societies and flood experience were positively and significantly related with institutional measures, such as support from social network and National and State Emergency Management Agencies. These observations underscore the need for training, cooperatives and enhanced farm capacity (credit and farm size) in coping with flood by the farmers. It is recommended that governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should assist the farmers in these regards. Originality/value - Climate change induced flooding has become a developmental issue across the world. As countries continue to be hit by massive flooding, food production also continues to be hit adversely. Nigeria has joined this league because of the rampage flooding across the country in recent times. Anambra State is down stream of both rivers Niger and Benue and, hence, one of the states vulnerable to flooding in Nigeria. Available literature suggests that greater efforts have been made to quantify the economic implications of flooding on agriculture and the concomitant coping strategies in developed than in developing countries. This paper, therefore, assesses the extent of losses suffered by farm households, their level of vulnerability and flood coping strategies.","[Enete, Anselm Anibueze] Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Obi, Joy N.] Agr Policy Res Network, Nsukka, Enugu, Nigeria; [Ozor, Nicholas] African Technol Policy Studies Network, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mba, Chinedu Lilian] Univ Nigeria, Dept Geog, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Nigeria; University of Nigeria,"Enete, AA (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria.",anselm.enete@unn.edu.ng,,,,,,,24,9,9,6,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

They foster local economic development by mobilizing deposits and lending these out to individuals, families, farmers, and small businesses in the same area. Using balanced panel data of 457 RuSACCOs from Ethiopia over the period 2014-17, we show how deposit mobilization affects technical efficiency. Our first stage efficiency estimate by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Window model shows the average efficiency of RuSACCOs gradually increased over time. The second stage Tobit censored estimation and bootstrapped truncated regression results confirms our hypotheses for key and control variables effects on technical efficiency. Focusing on rapid expansion during the early life cycle affects technical efficiency. A high percentage of women membership in cooperative enterprises advances technical efficiency. Furthermore, attracting and including all segments of the local entrepreneurial class as a membership opens the possibilities for mobilizing more deposits to become efficient.","[Duguma, Girma Jirata; Han, Jiqin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Han, JQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China.",jhan@njau.edu.cn,"Duguma, Girma Jirata/AAB-4858-2019","Duguma, Girma Jirata/0000-0002-5268-1923",Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD) [SKGL2020006],Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), Grant/Award Number: SKGL2020006",,67,4,4,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

One proposed benefit of such collaborations is the enhanced knowledge exchange and learning which may be created, and in the literature the dynamics of this are often explained via the concepts of embeddedness and/or social capital. To date however, studies tend towards a somewhat narrow, territorial, interpretation of these concepts, with the result that current understanding of how collaborations and learning evolve between rural actors is rather constrained. This paper aims to explore a broader interpretation of these concepts, through case analysis of a producer cooperative in the Scottish shellfish sector. In the case, the realities of member and management relations are revealed, along with the types of knowledge generated and the processes by which these are, or are not, shared between actors. In terms of embeddedness, our analysis reveals that, rather than the local community context which tends to dominate the literature, it is sectoral norms and habits which shape actor relations and learning most significantly in this case. In terms of social capital, we identify that tension fuelled social relations are not in themselves a barrier to collaboration, again in contrast to existing claims, particularly where key actors have appropriate interpersonal skills, and where a values-based mindset ('cooperative know-how') is held in common. The findings therefore challenge popular assumptions about how embeddedness and social capital shape collective action and learning in rural areas, and illustrate the value of interpreting these concepts more expansively.

In this sense and given the current scenario of marketplace instability and uncertainty, the way firms develop and manage their intellectual capital (IC) is crucial. Firms can be distinguished from their rivals in terms of their ability to identify, invest in and manage their IC - in other words the knowledge over which they exercise control or influence - an intangible asset that is not as easily quantifiable or replicable as other assets. In today's globalized and highly competitive world, the only way to compete with producers benefiting from low production costs is to invest in people, and this requires organizations to believe in the creative ability, emotional intelligence and adaptability of their staff and collaborators. Human resources with appropriate skills, motivation and commitment are the key to increased competitiveness because only they have the capacity to create products and services with greater value for the consumer and thereby generate better performance by the organization. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of IC as a key driver of organizational performance due to its centrality as an asset in the value creation process (Chen, Shih and Yang, 2009; Kang and Snell, 2009; Campisini and Costa, 2008). However, few studies have demonstrated the relationship that may be developed between various aspects of IC and the satisfaction felt by the staff involved (Longo and Mura, 2011). Employee satisfaction (in general) and promotion opportunities expressing organizational recognition of staff contributions (in particular) provide a stimulus to greater committed to the organization's interests and thereby enhance productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. Clearly, since human resources (HR) constitute the only asset that, strictly speaking, the organization does not own, and that the time and money it spends on training can easily be wasted if staff turnover is high, it is crucial for 21st century organizations of all types to attract, develop and above all retain qualified, committed and satisfied staff. Our focus on Credit Cooperatives (CC) is explained by their emergence as a significant alternative to large financial corporations - especially private banks. CCs are able to offer specific and attractive benefits to their members and can play a key role in stimulating socioeconomic development at the territorial level (Araujo and Silva, 2011; Segui-Mas and Izquierdo, 2010). The aims of the research reported on here were (1) to identify which aspects of IC most influence employee satisfaction in the financial institutions analyzed and (2) to specify the type of influence these dimensions have on staff satisfaction. Data were collected using a questionnaire based on Bontis (1998) applied to all employees of a CC in north-eastern Brazil. After processing the data using SPSS 21.0, it was found that (1) Human Capital is not an unidimensional concept and was further subdivided into training and participation; and (2) only structural and relational dimensions of IC affected respondents' satisfaction positively. By making known to organizational leaders and managers that there exists a link - albeit indirect - between IC and organizational performance may encourage them to invest more in an intangible asset that has the intrinsic ability to create sustainable flows of value for both client and organization.","[Leal, Carmem; Marques, Carla Susana; Marques, Carlos Peixeira] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CETRAD, Vila Real, Portugal; [Braga-Filho, Elizomar] UNICRED, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Leal, C (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CETRAD, Vila Real, Portugal.",cleal@utad.pt; smarques@utad.pt; cmarques@utad.pt; elizomarfilho@live.com.br,"Leal, Carmem P/V-7073-2017; Marques, Carlos/P-8077-2016; Marques, Ana/GRR-9117-2022; Marques, Carla Susana/U-2410-2018","Leal, Carmem P/0000-0002-7860-9858; Marques, Carlos/0000-0001-6274-9082; Marques, Carla Susana/0000-0003-1557-1319",,,,,47,0,0,0,15,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2048-8963,,978-1-910309-35-3,PROC EUR CONF KNOWL,,,2014,,,,,,,578,585,,,,,,8,"Business; Psychology, Applied; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Psychology,BC3AS,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000351503500069,0

In this article, we propose a partially-centralized organization of consumers (or agents), namely, a consumer cooperative that purchases electricity from the market. In the cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group. The technical challenge is that consumers make their own demand decisions, based on their private demand constraints and preferences, which they do not share with the coordinator or other agents. We propose a novel multiagent coordination algorithm, to shape the energy demand of the cooperative. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information, the coordinator determines virtual price signals that it sends to the consumers to induce them to shift their demands when required. We prove that this algorithm converges to the central optimal solution and minimizes the electric energy cost of the cooperative. Additionally, we present results on the time complexity of the iterative algorithm and its implications for agents' incentive compatibility. Furthermore, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to (a) characterize the convergence properties of our algorithm and (b) understand the effect of differing demand characteristics of participants as well as of different price functions on the cost reduction. The results show that the convergence time scales linearly with the agent population size and length of the optimization horizon. Finally, we observe that as participants' flexibility of shifting their demands increases, cost reduction increases and that the cost reduction is not sensitive to variation in consumption patterns of the consumers.","[Veit, Andreas] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Xu, Ying; Zheng, Ronghuo] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Chakraborty, Nilanjan] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mech Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Sycara, Katia] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Inst Robot, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Cornell University; Carnegie Mellon University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Carnegie Mellon University,"Veit, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ANDREAS@CS.CORNELL.EDU; YINGX1@ANDREW.CMU.EDU; RONGHUOZ@ANDREW.CMU.EDU; NILANJAN.CHAKRABORTY@STONYBROOK.EDU; KATIA@CS.CMU.EDU,"shrivastava, Ankit/AFY-6130-2022; Zheng, Ronghuo/B-4244-2019","shrivastava, Ankit/0000-0003-4445-8817;",NSF [IIS-1218542],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was partially supported by NSF award IIS-1218542.,,32,10,10,0,6,AI ACCESS FOUNDATION,MARINA DEL REY,"USC INFORMATION SCIENCES INST, 4676 ADMIRALITY WAY, MARINA DEL REY, CA 90292-6695 USA",1076-9757,1943-5037,,J ARTIF INTELL RES,J.

Consolidation that is occurring in the financial services industry has spilled over into agricultural banking. This has raised concerns as to whether banks that have traditionally supplied credit to production agriculture will continue to do so after consolidation. Another major concern is whether consolidation is motivated by greater efficiency, or whether consolidation is resulting in greater market power without achieving cost savings. Study of the production technology of financial institutions can determine whether and to what degree economies of size exist and how agricultural lending will fit into the overall business plans of consolidated banks. Generally, empirical studies have used either duality theory with the estimation of cost functions or nonparametric estimation methods to assess efficiency in the financial services industry. The purpose of the present study is to estimate economies of scope and scale in agricultural banking. This will be accomplished through estimation of an indirect multi-product cost function. The uniqueness of this study, when compared to previous studies of efficiency of the financial services industry, i's the disaggregation of the outputs so that agricultural lending can be evaluated. In addition, a normalized quadratic cost function is estimated with curvature properties imposed. Clark reviewed thirteen studies that measured economies of scope and scale for commercial banks, credit unions, and savings and loan associations. He found that they offered four broad conclusions: (a) overall economies of scale exist at low levels of input, (b) no consistent evidence of economies of scope exists, (c) some evidence of cost complementarities exists, and (d) the results seem to be robust among financial institutions. Humphery also reviewed studies that examine the issue of economies of scale for banks and found that little cost savings exist for increases in size alone. He concluded that significant benefits accrue from loan diversification. Humphery also reported that the differences in cost structure within the same firm size category are larger than measured cost economies. Berger, Hunter, and Timme reviewed the efficiency of financial institutions. They discovered that many of the previous studies showed the average cost curve to be relatively flat. They also suggested that differences in technologies may occur between small and large banks or that some factor that varies with bank size may be excluded from previous studies. McAllister and McManus found that the translog cost function specification gives a poor approximation when applied to all bank sizes, suggesting that nonparametric estimation procedures should be examined. In addition, they included risk as a cost factor in the estimation. Berger, Hunter, and Timme suggested that, although frontier estimation methods are theoretically correct, studies that have compared results of frontier methods to those of more traditional estimation methods have found only small differences for scale measures.","UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT FOOD & RESOURCE ECON,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"FEATHERSTONE, AM (corresponding author), KANSAS STATE UNIV AGR & APPL SCI,DEPT AGR ECON,MANHATTAN,KS 66506, USA.",,"Moss, Charles B/U-5254-2017","Moss, Charles B/0000-0002-1172-7112",,,,,18,25,25,1,29,AMER AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,AMES,"1110 BUCKEYE AVE, AMES, IA 50010-8063",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Free-riders can invade a society of cooperators, causing a tragedy of the commons. Such social dilemmas can be overcome by positive or negative incentives. Even though an incentive-providing institution may protect a cooperative society from invasion by free-riders, it cannot always convert a society of free-riders to cooperation. In the latter case, both norms, cooperation and defection, are stable: To avoid a collapse to full defection, cooperators must be sufficiently numerous initially. A society of free-riders is then caught in a social trap, and the institution is unable to provide an escape, except at a high, possibly prohibitive cost. Here, we analyze the interplay of (a) incentives provided by institutions and (b) the effects of voluntary participation. We show that this combination fundamentally improves the efficiency of incentives. In particular, optional participation allows institutions punishing free-riders to overcome the social dilemma at a much lower cost, and to promote a globally stable regime of cooperation. This removes the social trap and implies that whenever a society of cooperators cannot be invaded by free-riders, it will necessarily become established in the long run, through social learning, irrespective of the initial number of cooperators. We also demonstrate that punishing provides a lighter touch than rewarding, guaranteeing full cooperation at considerably lower cost.","[Sasaki, Tatsuya; Brannstrom, Ake; Dieckmann, Ulf; Sigmund, Karl] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Brannstrom, Ake] Umea Univ, Dept Math & Math Stat, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Sigmund, Karl] Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Umea University; University of Vienna,"Sigmund, K (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",karl.sigmund@univie.ac.at,"Brännström, Åke/E-7850-2011; Dieckmann, Ulf/E-1424-2011; Sasaki, Tatsuya/A-9993-2012","Dieckmann, Ulf/0000-0001-7089-0393; Sasaki, Tatsuya/0000-0002-4635-1389; Brannstrom, Ake/0000-0001-9862-816X",Austrian Science Fund [TECT I-106 G11]; European Commission; European Science Foundation; Austrian Ministry of Science and Research; Vienna Science and Technology Fund; [TECT I-104 G1]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 106] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Science Foundation(European Science Foundation (ESF)); Austrian Ministry of Science and Research; Vienna Science and Technology Fund; ; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This study was enabled by financial support (TECT I-106 G11) from the Austrian Science Fund (to U.D.), through a grant for the research project The Adaptive Evolution of Mutualistic Interactions as part of the multinational collaborative research project Mutualisms, Contracts, Space, and Dispersal (BIOCONTRACT) selected by the European Science Foundation as part of the European Collaborative Research (EUROCORES) Programme The Evolution of Cooperation and Trading (TECT).

Based on archival material, the article explores Wollemborg's biography and develops a content analysis of his discourses. The findings show that, by making a pervasive use of face-to-face narrative accountability, Wollemborg obtained trust and engagement of external potential stakeholders, thus expanding the rural credit cooperatives (Raiffeisen-style).

Various brands of embodied, extended, enacted, and distributed cognition, some more conservative and some more liberal, have paraded in philosophy and cognitive science. I call the genus including all such species situated cognition and go on to depict selected cases in nonhuman comparative cognition. Distributed cognition is often used as another term for situated cognition. But behavioral biologists have used the term in another sense, to mean the reduction of cognitive capacities arising from team work in cooperative societies. Hymenopteran insects have been studied as cases. The octopus displays embodied cognition, with some of the computational work offloaded to the periphery. Web-building spiders showcase extended cognition, in which objects external to the animal-the web, in the case of spiders-play a crucial causal role in cognition. A criterion of mutual manipulability, in which causal influence flows both ways between organism and extended object, serves to delimit the scope of extended cognition. Play in dogs features intelligence on-the-run, arising out of action, a key characteristic of enactive cognition. I discuss other cases in which action entwines with central representational cognition to achieve goal-directed behavior. Considering situated cognition in diverse animals leads to myriad research questions that can enrich the field.","[Cheng, Ken] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Cheng, K (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",ken.cheng@mq.edu.au,,"Cheng, Ken/0000-0002-4913-2691",,,,,134,24,24,6,58,COMPARATIVE COGNITION SOC,KINGSTON,"COMPARATIVE COGNITION SOC, KINGSTON, ON 00000, CANADA",1911-4745,,,COMP COGN BEHAV REV,Comp.

As a result there is greater awareness of safety concerns, emerging risks and challenges in the context of food products. Consumers want guarantees for food characteristics, thus, calling for transparency and effective response in case of any food related health problem. This paper presents a framework for transparency, traceability and information flow for management of dairy supply chain networks. This paper follows a case study approach and presents findings from three types of dairy supply chains as prevalent in India. The paper analyses complexity of dairy products as well as processes in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors and their effects on the underlying dairy supply chain networks (DSCN). Governance mechanisms dovetailing various stages of the DSCN are presented in terms of their gaps and adequacy. Key components of the presented frameworks are harmonization of national standards with codex standards, hygiene control, strengthening quality control systems, enhancing information flow across stages, animal health care, disease free zones and formation of cooperatives of small dairy processors (CSDP) in line with the present dairy cooperative society (DCS). CSDP aims at collective action and public-private partnerships by the unorganized sector units to face the competition from large organized processors of dairy products in terms of quality, transparency, traceability and information flow. Transparency of a DSCN is the extent to which all its stakeholders have a shared understanding of and access to the product related information without loss, noise, delay and distortion. Given the perishable nature of dairy products, an effective traceability system is an important tool not only to manage food quality and safety risks, but also to promote the development of effective dairy supply chain management. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on transparency and traceability issues of dairy supply chain networks. Findings would be useful for policy makers in framing standards and effective regulations. Analysis of complexity would be useful for dairy industry managers.","[Prakash, Gyan] ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management Gwa, Gwalior, India; [Pant, R.

This analysis is then applied in a particular social economy initiative, Cretamo, a consumers' cooperative operating a grocery store in Thessaloniki, Greece. The results indicate that Cretamo has developed in the central node of an eco-system of same-minded social enterprises in the agro-food sector, offering an alternative niche to the mainstream economic model. This has changed relations both within the initiative and in its networks, while, at the same time, allows for increased innovativeness capacities. Cretamo has not yet the power to challenge the existing mainstream regime. Yet, it offers a valid alternative niche, which, combined with the socio-economic crisis still experienced in Greece and expected to intensify in the future, creates strong potential for societal transformation.","[Amanatidou, Effie; Tzekou, Eirini-Erifyli; Gritzas, Giorgos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Lab Cospace Studies Collect Practices Space & Dev, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Amanatidou, Effie] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Gritzas, Giorgos] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Social Sci, Social & Solidar Econ MSc Program, Patras, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; Hellenic Open University,"Amanatidou, E (corresponding author), Pavlou Mela 16, Trilofos 57500, Thessalonikis, Greece.",Effie.Amanatidou@gmail.com,,"Amanatidou, Effie/0000-0002-3574-5606",European Union (European Social Fund -ESF) through the Operational Programme <> [MIS 5047855],European Union (European Social Fund -ESF) through the Operational Programme <>,"This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund -ESF) through the Operational Programme << Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020 >> in the context of the project Social Innovation in the framework of Social and Solidarity Economy under the Community Economies perspective [MIS 5047855].'",,73,3,3,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1942-0676,1942-0684,,J SOC ENTREP,J.

Adopting a broad class of such technologies and practices is often critical for meeting the multifaceted goals of efficiency, profitability, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience. This study aims to address the knowledge gaps that still exist concerning what determines the adoption of improved technologies and production practices, the factors affecting their diffusion, the impact of interventions on productivity and crops grown, and the variability of impact within a particular country context. In this paper we address these questions using data collected as part of the USAID-led Knowledge-Based Integrated Sustainable Agriculture in Nepal (KISAN) project. We adopted a multistage sampling technique and surveyed 988 beneficiary households and 997 non-beneficiary households in KISAN intervention districts and non-intervention districts. Our findings suggest that, in Nepal, adoption of improved technologies and practices is significantly increased by improved access to markets, private sector involvement in selling improved seeds and disseminating information, membership in progressive farmers groups and cooperative societies, participation in agricultural training and farm visits, provision of subsidies for seeds, and access to credit. We also found the probability of the adoption of improved practices to be affected by farmers' sources of information; for instance, the adoption of improved practices was increased when farmers obtained information from informal sources, cooperatives/farmers organizations, and public and private extension programs. The effects of KISAN projects vary significantly across the different crops grown, based on the evaluation models that address self-selection of both project participation and crop choices. These implications may also apply to other parts of the world facing similar challenges as Nepal, where limited market access, insufficient knowledge and resource capacity of farmers constrain their adoption of improved technologies and practices in agriculture.","[Kumar, Anjani; Saroj, Sunil; Joshi, P.

The objective of the research was to analyze the internal control process of the 14 Savings and Credit Cooperatives of the canton La Mana, province of Cotopaxi, for which the COSO model questionnaire was adapted, applied as part of the observation method, and finally descriptive statistics were applied for the analysis of the data obtained. It was determined that the Control Environment, Control Activities and Supervision and Monitoring components have a high level of performance, while the Risk Assessment and Information and Communication components showed a lower level of compliance in the cooperatives studied.","[Garcia Bravos, Mayra Elizabeth; Hurtado Garcia, Ketty del Rocio; Ponce Alava, Veronica; Sanchez Moreira, Jeniffer Maria] Univ Tecn Cotopaxi Extens La Mana, Guayaquil, Ecuador",,"Bravos, MEG (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Cotopaxi Extens La Mana, Guayaquil, Ecuador.",mayra.garcia2684@utc.edu.ec; ketty.hurtado@utc.edu.ec; veronica.ponce6312@utc.edu.ec; jeniffer.sanchez4693@utc.edu.ec,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,UNIV PINAR RIO HERMANOS SAIZ MONTES OCA,PINA DEL RIO,"CALLE MARTI NO 300 27 NOVIEMBRE & GONZALEZ ALCORTA, PINA DEL RIO, CP 20100, CUBA",2310-340X,,,REV COOP DESARRO-COO,Rev.

The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth, using China's provincial panel data from 1997 to 2014. Design/methodology/approach Both static fixed effects models and two-step generalized method of moment dynamic panel data models, which control the endogeneity, are employed to identify the causality from RCC credit to agricultural growth in China. Findings The results show that the credit from RCCs increases the agricultural output significantly. A 1 percent increase in RCC credit leads to agricultural growth of about 0.08 percent, which is robust to various empirical specifications. Further study shows that the contribution of RCC credit to agricultural growth decreases from the most developed eastern region to the least developed western region and increases over time. Research limitations/implications The results imply that RCC credit is critical in financing agricultural activities by relaxing rural credit constraints and intense competition strengthens the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth by improving managerial efficiency and developing diversified financial products to meet better rural credit demands. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is first empirical study on the effect of RCC credit on agricultural growth despite of many on the role of financial development in agricultural growth.","[Nan, Yongqing; Gao, Yanyan; Zhou, Qin] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Gao, YY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",nanyongqinga@163.com; adamesky@gmail.com; zhouqin63@seu.edu.cn,"Gao, Yanyan/AAE-6607-2022; Gao, Yanyan/AAL-7187-2020","Gao, Yanyan/0000-0003-0326-504X; Gao, Yanyan/0000-0003-0326-504X",,,,,53,11,12,1,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

Having pioneered many of the features of modern large-scale retailing since its origins in the mid-nineteenth century, from the 1950s the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) and the retail cooperative societies it served experienced plummeting market share, continued internecine rivalries, and increasing marginalization. In the early twenty-first century, however, co-operatives improved their market share and experienced a Renaissance in commercial fortunes despite continued fierce competition in food retailing. As yet there has been little exploration of the nature of this turnaround and the ways in which the once-foundering cooperative business model was re-engineered. Drawing on new research into the CWS (renamed The Co-operative Group in 2001), this article provides a historical analysis of the movement's decline and revival. As the article details, from the 1950s significant efforts were made to reform CWS and the movement as a whole. However, co-operatives were slow to adapt to the changing business environment, hampered by dysfunctional organizational dynamics that constrained structural change and limited efforts to compete with private retail multiples. Following an unsuccessful takeover bid for CWS in 1997, co-operative opinion coalesced around the need for change. In the final section, the authors analyze the factors underpinning the Renaissance, focusing on both organizational innovations and the reassertion of core values and principles on which co-operation had been built. This provides a fascinating illustration of how a business can respond effectively to internal and external challenges, yet retain its fundamental character.","[Wilson, John] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Webster, Anthony] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Hist, Liverpool L1 9HW, Merseyside, England; [Vorberg-Rugh, Rachael] Cooperat Coll, Manchester M60 0AS, Lancs, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Liverpool; Liverpool John Moores University,"Wilson, J (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",john.wilson4@ncl.ac.uk; T.Webster@ljmu.ac.uk; rachael@co-op.ac.uk,,"Webster, Anthony/0000-0002-1424-0318",,,,,66,8,8,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1467-2227,,,ENTERP SOC,Enterp.

Reflecting such influences these firms adopted two particularly important aspects of democratic governance: use of low denomination partly paid shares to encourage wide share ownership among local working class operatives, and the use of a one shareholder one vote rule at company meetings. Prior literature, much of which predicts the failure of producer co-operatives due to incentive problems, has not specifically examined these aspects of democratic control. Moreover because the case study utilises samples of stock market quoted companies, there is an opportunity to quantify the financial performance effects of these governance mechanisms. The case study therefore offers a unique insight and important contribution to the wider literature. The results show that both aspects of democratic governance contributed to the economic success of the companies that adopted them, enabling them to satisfy the high demand for cash dividends that characterised investor requirements. However, the cyclical nature of the cotton industry and the stock market booms and slumps that resulted led to redistributions of wealth through time that in the long run undermined the co-operative project.","[Toms, Steven] Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Toms, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",j.s.toms@leeds.ac.uk,"Toms, Steve/G-5572-2017","Toms, Steve/0000-0002-6147-7828",,,,,48,12,12,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-6791,1743-7938,,BUS HIST,Bus.

Our study fills this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of property rights reform on banks' capital adequacy in China and heterogeneity across restructured forms of ownership, reform pathways, and time. Using data from rural credit cooperatives in China for 2008-2014, we find that rural cooperative banks have better capital adequacy than banks under two other forms of ownership. We further find that among four possible reform pathways, only restructuring from a rural cooperative bank to a rural commercial bank enhances capital adequacy significantly and that improvements in capital adequacy generally weaken over time. Further analyses indicate that this improvement is primarily attributable to capital injections and removal of non-performing assets by the government. These findings contribute to an understanding of how best to reform rural finance, particularly in developing countries.","[Wang, Jiamei] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haibin; Luo, Jianchao] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Heng] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Finance & Banking, Beijing 100710, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Mingwang] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiaping] East China Normal Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",Chongqing Jiaotong University; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Tongji University; East China Normal University,"Zhang, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Finance & Banking, Beijing 100710, Peoples R China.",jiamei86_wang@163.com; hbchen@nwafu.edu.cn; zh20170633@163.com; jchluo@nwafu.edu.cn; walkercheng@163.com; jpzhang@fem.ecnu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Heng/0000-0001-9788-4743; Zhang, Jiaping/0000-0002-0595-7202",,,,,60,1,1,10,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, the emerging trend of losing the competitive positions of the consumer cooperative system in the regional consumer markets in Russia leads to the realization of the need for institutional changes that would allow full use of the economic and social potential of the development of consumer cooperation in the conditions of the structural transformation of Russian society. The authors offer practical recommendations on the design and formation of effective forms of management of economic entities in the cooperative sector, as well as the development of a new institutional model of innovative development of the system of consumer cooperation adequate to the challenges of modern society, capable of restoring the competitive positions of its subjects in the regional market. Modeling of sustainable innovative development of the regional system of consumer cooperation assumes the use of the following system-forming components: resources (material, human resources, knowledge, technologies, etc. necessary for the production of an innovative product), space (territorially differentiated innovation activity of economic systems), institutions (set of rules and Mechanisms that stimulate the innovative activity of economic systems). It is the personnel resource as the most difficultly formalized will be the subject of our consideration. The choice of the vector of its strategic transformation should be directed in favor of new methods of managing this resource, in order to achieve the set goal with nonincreasing material costs. The first stage in the implementation of the proposed system may be the formation of a basis for designing the vector of economic development, namely, the creation of map-bases of the basic regional resources. And, as an example, the creation of a single regional base of the labor reserve as a key (system-forming) factor. It is the definition of the structure of this resource that will give the main impulse for the rational formation of this or that production cycle.

Key data are monthly observations9,800 for supermarkets and 2,150 for hypermarkets (large superstores combining supermarkets and department stores). By estimating first-difference models, the authors find that hypermarket stores with cooperative ownership have significantly faster sales growth than do GESPA stores. For supermarkets overall, they find no significant differences in performance among the three types of stores. For a subgroup of small supermarkets, however, cooperatives outperform conventional stores. To investigate the mechanisms that help explain why cooperatives perform better, the authors provide additional evidence that takes into account the more extensive opportunities for employee involvement, training, and stronger economic incentives in cooperatives. While cooperative members are better paid than peers in comparable firms, individual data show that job satisfaction is lower for cooperative workers than for GESPA workers.

However, little is known about how deposit mobilization affects financial sustainability. Using balanced panel data of 166 rural savings and credit cooperatives (RUSACCOs) from Ethiopia over the period of 2014-2016, we investigated the effect of deposit mobilization on financial sustainability. The results of the panel regression estimates showed that, among the deposits mobilization variables, the deposit to loan ratio, deposit to total asset ratio, the volume of deposits, and demand deposit ratio had a significant direct impact on financial sustainability. The fixed effect regression result for interest rate spread showed that an inverse relationship existed between the interest rate spread and financial sustainability. Furthermore, according to our robust fixed effect regression results, among the control variables, the age of the institution and inflation rate affects financial sustainability. Contrary to our expectations, the number of members and the percentage of woman members were not significant. This may be attributed to the fact that some members were inactive for a long period. We suggest that RUSACCOs should focus on deposit mobilization specifically on demand deposits and keep the interest rate spread narrower to ensure their sustainability.","[Duguma, Girma Jirata; Han, Jiqin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Han, JQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1Weigang, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",girmajirata@yahoo.com; jhan@njau.edu.cn,"Duguma, Girma Jirata/AAB-4858-2019","Duguma, Girma Jirata/0000-0002-5268-1923",Chinese Ministry of Agriculture [2016-X10]; NAU [KYGB201802],Chinese Ministry of Agriculture(Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs); NAU,This research was funded by Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (2016-X10) and NAU (KYGB201802).,,76,9,9,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,3387,10.3390/su10103387,0,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GY4UB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000448559400029,0

This article uses a survey of 6,000 households in Nepal, a developing economy, to enhance understanding of the factors driving solar-system uptake by households. A key contribution is the breadth of analysis. We find important influences for economic, social, and locational factors. In contrast, physical dwelling aspects, such as roof material, appear to be less important. Social influences explain extra variation in solar-panel uptake, when comparing social and economic influences, although some variables could be classified in multiple categories. For example, membership in a women's saving and credit cooperative is a socioeconomic factor that is associated with greater solar-panel adoption. Socioeconomic factors may be the most important for future policy innovations, given that existing policy already focuses on location. For instance, this article finds that solar adoption has been much higher in the most supported regions for the Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy.","[Best, Rohan] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nepal, Rabindra] Univ Wollongong, Fac Business & Law, Sch Business, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Wollongong,"Best, R (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",rohan.best@mq.edu.au,,"Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206; Best, Rohan/0000-0002-9333-6149",,,,,44,3,3,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article argues that we are observing a regime shift in the transaction costs of organizing that disfavors traditional corporations. Accompanying this shift is the emergence of low-cost, small-scale production technologies that will allow locally based universal fabrication facilities. In combination, these changes are compatible with new forms of non-corporate enterprise. While corporations are basic units of production in many theories about the economy, they should be regarded as only one hypothesis about how production is and can be organized. Traditional alternatives to the corporation include producer and consumer cooperatives (e.g., Land o' Lakes, REI) and mutuals (e.g., State Farm, Vanguard). More recent possibilities include commons-based peer production (such as Linux and Wikipedia) and platforms that connect buyers and sellers (such as Uber and Airbnb). The raw materials are available for more democratic and locally oriented enterprise. Management scholarship has an opportunity to document and encourage this movement.","[Davis, Gerald F.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Davis, Gerald F.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Sociol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Davis, GF (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Davis, GF (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Sociol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",gfdavis@umich.edu,,,,,,,24,63,63,0,60,ACAD MANAGEMENT,BRIARCLIFF MANOR,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",1558-9080,,,ACAD MANAGE PERSPECT,Acad.

In contrast to the general failure one CEO, Terry Thomas stands out both for his success in co-operative rebranding and returning to profitability the UK Co-operative Bank and because he alone amongst the top echelons of the Co-operative Groups Management based his strategies on a clearly articulated philosophy based on his understanding of the values and purpose of the co-operative movement rooted in its historical traditions grounded in the writings and achievements of Robert Owen, The paper goes on to provide a case study of the bank's process of transformation from loss-making subsidiary to the first positive co-operative national brand in the post-war period of its history. The author argues that lack of appropriate vision based on the founding values and purposes of the Co-operative Movement is the principal reason for the management's and governance failures that have beset the UK Co-operative Group. Instead of using the past to help in understanding the present and planning for the future, the UK Co-operative Group Leadership ignored it or worse used the past successes to congratulate itself and disguise its manifest failures. In this, they were supported by an uncritical Co-operative Union (later renamed Co-operatives UK). Davis argues large co-operatives cannot be managed by a civil service responsible to an elected board. Co-operatives need a servant-leadership model of professional management dedicated to the transformational goals set by the founders of the co-operative movement. This needs a radical rethink and promotion of co-operative management education and a dedicated executive recruitment that seeks out value-based professionals whose attitudes and values are compatible with Co-operative values, ownership and purpose.","[Davis, Peter] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Davis, P (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England.",pd8@le.ac.uk,"Silva, Gleibson/HPF-3674-2023; Silva, Gleibson/AAA-8482-2021","Silva, Gleibson/0000-0003-0945-2567; Silva, Gleibson/0000-0003-0945-2567",,,,,23,4,4,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

Yet those early corporations differed from their contemporary counterparts in important ways. Most obviously, they commonly deviated from the one-share-one-vote rule that is customary today, instead adopting restricted voting schemes that favored small over large shareholders. In recent years, both legal scholars and economists have sought to explain these schemes as a rough form of investor protection, shielding small shareholders from exploitation by controlling shareholders in an era when investor protection law was weak. We argue, in contrast, that restricted voting rules generally served not to protect shareholders as investors, but to protect them as consumers. The firms adopting such rules were frequently local monopolies that provided vital infrastructural services such as transportation, banking, and insurance. The local merchants, farmers, and landholders who used these services were the firms' principal shareholders. They commonly purchased shares not in the expectation of profit, but to finance collective goods. Restricted shareholder voting assured that control of the firms' services would not fall into the hands of monopolists or competitors. In effect, the corporations had much the character of consumer cooperatives. This perspective also sheds light on the unusual importance given to the doctrine of ultra vires in the nineteenth century. While current legal and economic scholarship has focused incessantly on the separation between ownership and control, the prior separation between ownership and consumption, accomplished by the late nineteenth century, was another fundamental but generally overlooked turning point in the history of the business corporation. Understanding this transformation throws light not just on historical practices, but also on contemporary debates over deviations from the rule of one-share-one-vote.","[Hansmann, Henry] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pargendler, Mariana] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Sch Law, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Yale University; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE),"Hansmann, H (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,"Pargendler, Mariana/AAK-2436-2021","Pargendler, Mariana/0000-0002-5837-7199",,,,,145,14,14,0,12,YALE LAW J CO INC,NEW HAVEN,"401-A YALE STATION, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520 USA",0044-0094,1939-8611,,YALE LAW J,Yale Law J.,JAN,2014,123,4,,,,,948,1013,,,,,,66,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,AA9NE,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000331419400002,0

The study shows that the cooperative system is characterized by the complementarity of traits (social and economic), the dialectical interaction of which serves as the basis for the formation of civil society (self-organization and voluntary cooperation of shareholders in the process of production and economic activity) and a peculiar locomotive of the evolution of society towards building socially-oriented market economy (non-commercial nature of activities and humanistic values). However, the emerging trend of losing the competitive positions of the consumer cooperative system in the regional consumer markets in Russia leads to an awareness of the need for institutional changes that would make it possible to fully utilize the economic and social potential of the development of consumer cooperation in the context of the structural transformation of Russian society. The authors offer practical recommendations on the design and formation of effective forms of management of economic entities in the cooperative sector. Complex nature of the economic resource requires its inclusion in the correlation algorithm of proactive management. Simulation of sustainable innovation development of the regional system of consumer cooperation is possible only using optimization-qualimetric modeling on the platform of the software product.

In 2017, the Federal Program was adopted, in order to increase labor productivity and contribute to employment. To implement the Program, representatives of enterprises of all fields and all business entities must participate actively. The results of an expert interview demonstrate that executives are very concerned with the problem of low labor productivity in the whole country, in Kemerovo region, in their own enterprises, and can see the ways of its solution, but they are not included properly in corresponding managing aspects. On the average, in the agro-industrial sector the labor productivity increase goes on faster than in other industrial fields of our country, but in terms of value it is low. When workers of a Kuzbass enterprise containing of two agricultural consumer cooperatives for the production of dairy products were questioned, it was revealed that there were the following problems: bad condition of equipment and mechanisms, uncomfortable work and rest schedule, unsatisfactory working tension and rhythm, ineffective system of work stimulation, insufficient social support for workers, and others.

The resistance of the powerful roaster industry, dominated by the giant Nestle, has made it impossible to improve the quality of the coffee sold on the domestic market, and its importation of cheap robusta coffee for use in instant preparations has further reduced prices. The survival of the producer cooperatives depends on their capacity to enter the market through niches such as the organic and Fair Trade, where they receive a better price for their products.

In particular, recognizing that management control change is a continuous organizational process (rather than an outcome), the trajectory of which is shaped by an incessant inter-play of several influences, this research intends to explore the way in which the implementation of a new integrated information system contributes to this process. To address this issue, the current research combines theoretical and empirical insights. After having reviewed the literature on the main topics and produced a theoretical understanding to illuminate the nature of the aforementioned changes, the research relies upon an illustrative case study concerning a medium-size cooperative society based in Italy. Recognising the complexity of organizational life, the field study does not aspire to isolate and define how and by how much ICT has been a driver of the management control change, but rather to explore the whole process of change in order to appreciate the diversity of interrelated influences which have shaped its trajectory and how these influences interacted with each-other. Among this inter-play of influences, the study aims then to investigate the particular role played by the two-way relationship between ICT and management control. The implementation of the new integrated information system has opened up several opportunities for the business management and in particular for the management control. However, so far, only part of these opportunities have been exploited. Furthermore, while it could be acknowledged that the new system facilitated the changes in management control both in its material and immaterial dimensions, it could not be concluded that they were the result of the implementation of the new system. Many other factors have interacted within the process of management control change. For example, of paramount importance has been the controller's determination to enact the change. The case study analyzes these factors and the way in which they have jointly facilitated and/or hindered the management control change.","[Maraghini, Maria Pia] Univ Siena, Dept Business & Social Studies, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,,maraghini@unisi.it,,"MARAGHINI, Maria Pia/0000-0002-6706-9710",,,,,40,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-04799-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,13,37,,10.1007/978-3-642-04800-5_2,0,,,25,Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BOG84,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000276614100004,0

Theoretical foundations have been neglected in this work, and no attempt has been made to relate these empirical findings to extensive evidence for rent-sharing, or wage differentials related to profits that are hard to explain on the basis of unobserved individual characteristics. Here we argue that explicit and implicit forms of profit sharing should be viewed as two sides of the same coin, and can both be given convincing theoretical foundations. Relevant models include the importance of fairness and equitable pay and repeated games with mutual monitoring by profit or rent-sharing workers. Most empirical work has neglected the selection problem, or the existence of favourable but unobserved preconditions for profit sharing, and so probably exaggerates productivity gains from profit sharing in isolation and benefits from tax incentives. Cross-sectional regressions have also failed to uncover specific channels of influence of profit sharing.","GESAMTHSCH KASSEL,W-3500 KASSEL,GERMANY",,"FITZROY, FR (corresponding author), UNIV ST ANDREWS,DEPT ECON,ST ANDREWS KY16 9ST,FIFE,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,,44,12,12,0,6,HELBING & LICHTENHAHN VERLAG AG,BASEL,"FREIE STRASSE 84, CH-4051 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,1992,45,2,,,,,209,225,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.1992.tb02114.x,0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HW938,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:A1992HW93800004,0

Design/methodology/approach Two-stage least squares panel regression approach is utilized to analyse data covering 1,272 firm-year observations for 212 SACCOs over a six-year period, 2008-2013. An analysis of the pre- and post-regulation impacts on compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements is also performed. Findings The results, which are in support of the institutional theory, reveal that licensed SACCOs engage in higher compliance with mandatory disclosures, and this improves from the pre- to the post-regulation period. The results show that SACCOs under inquiry engage in lower compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements, especially in the post-regulation period. The findings also reveal a significant and positive association between SACCO size, co-operative governance and compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements. Research limitations/implications The study focuses on transition-level SACCOs in a single country. An extension into other jurisdictions with nascent, transitional and mature SACCOs would provide greater insights into the impact of disclosure regulation. Further, the study uses a self-constructed disclosure checklist which is subject to coding errors and biases. Practical implications The findings highlight the need for SACCO regulators and accounting professional body to devise incentives to improve the level of compliance with required disclosures. Originality/value The study contributes to the dearth of evidence on the efficacy of the introduction of mandatory disclosure requirements in a developing country where compliance is problematic because of difficulties with enforcement.","[Mathuva, David Mutua] Strathmore Univ, Strathmore Business Sch, Nairobi, Kenya; [Chong, H.

Cooperatives did increase credit supply but captured a small share of the credit market and reported net losses throughout the late colonial and early postcolonial period.

First, low savings restricted the role of social capital and mutual supervision as methods of financial regulation in the cooperative sector.

The study narrates how changes in the Ottoman Empire's institutional order during the Tanzimat era enabled conditions that led to the emergence of OMSs. Subsequently, the practices of the form transformed, especially after the Russian-Ottoman War, concomitant with further changes in Ottoman society's institutional order. Although OMSs initially enjoyed legitimacy granted by the Ottoman State, the shift towards dominating state logic in the Hamidian era led to the erosion of practices animated by market and community logics. The form was discontinued as the increasingly autocratic state levied taxes and preyed upon the accumulated surplus, which disabled agglomerative capacity of sandiks and diminished the solidarity among cooperative members.","[Soydemir, Cemil Ozan; Ercek, Mehmet] Istanbul Tech Univ, Management Engn Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Soydemir, CO (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Management Engn Dept, Istanbul, Turkey.",soydemirc@itu.edu.tr,"soydemir, cemil ozan/AAW-4982-2020; Ercek, Mehmet/X-9275-2019","soydemir, cemil ozan/0000-0001-6671-8873; Ercek, Mehmet/0000-0002-5212-7121",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [217K015],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),The authors thank The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey for its financial support (Grant no 217K015).,,138,3,3,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-6791,1743-7938,,BUS HIST,Bus.

The conceptual framework indicates the importance of the type of goods (being a club good or not) and range of activities that a cooperative provides to its members in defining a competitive boundary. Using unique organisational and market level data from Ethiopia, we then test empirically whether the observed (weak) performance of producers' cooperatives in Africa is explained by their organisational boundary - the type and range of goods or services they provide to members. The empirical results confirm that the competitiveness of producers' cooperatives is significantly correlated with the type and number of services - i.e. cooperatives that provide club goods and a limited range of services are found to be more competitive. The results also suggest that a considerable number of cooperatives in Ethiopia engage in markets where they do not have competitive advantage. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of properly defining a viable boundary - proper selection of services (or markets) and limiting the range of services - for improving the competitiveness of membership-based producer cooperatives in Africa.","[Tadesse, Getaw; Abate, Gashaw T.] IFPRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Ergano, Kebebe] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Manitoba,"Tadesse, G (corresponding author), IFPRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",g.tadesse@cgiar.org,,"Ergano, Kebebe/0000-0002-9327-657X",,,,,55,11,11,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically investigates repression in rural China using the McKinnon-Shaw model and microeconomic data combined with lending and savings rates and ceilings by rural credit cooperatives. Findings - The paper finds only limited evidence of a repression dominated by savings, while investment response appears to be, at least on average, normal or unrepressed. More specifically, the paper finds that the relationship between growth and investment is consistent with an unrepressed economy but savings do show evidence of repression. Originality/value - The political focus of economic reformation in China has been one of rapid economic growth in urban areas and a neglect of the agriculture sector. This focus on urban growth has led some Chinese scholars to speculate that the residual impact is a repressed agricultural and rural economy, at least in the context of McKinnon and Shaw framework. However, such speculations have not previously been verified.

Second, it argues that, in rejecting notions of 'normal' subjectivity, in seeing the human subject as fundamentally irrational, in viewing power as coextensive with society itself, as a relationship that can only be managed as opposed to abolished, in repudiating grand theory or metanarratives in favour of 'micro-politics', and in viewing science as both epistemologically flawed and potentially oppressive, Huxley anticipated postanarchism. Despite his reluctance to adopt a label, it is the contention of this article that Huxley ought to be considered a social anarchist.",,,,seafla@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-9317,1469-9613,,J POLIT IDEOL,J.

Cooperatives, as people-centred enterprises owned, controlled and managed by and for their members, have significant impacts on redirecting economic processes, solving social challenges, improving the quality of life in the local community and environmental protection in many countries all over the world. The purpose of the paper is to analyse the state, trends and challenges regarding development of cooperatives, in the context of social economy, in Croatia. The research was realised in two phases during 2018, using on-line questionnaires as main research instruments. The first phase was related to specific characteristics of cooperatives operating in Croatia and challenges they are faced with while the second part was related to students' perceptions and attitudes regarding cooperatives as business models. This paper presents the result of the first research phase. The research has revealed various internal and external barriers which hinder further development of cooperatives in Croatia.

We assessed the impact of various forest management regimes (FMRs): legal felling series [(reserve forest (RF), demarcated protected forest (DPF), un-demarcated protected forest (UPF), co-operative society forest (CSF) and un-classed forest (UF)] on biodiversity conservations and carbon storage in Acacia catechu Willd. Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in Nurpur Forest Division of north-western Himalaya, India. The study revealed significant variations in floristic composition, biodiversity indices, population structure and C storage potential among different forest management regimes. The RF and DPF were found to be rich in species diversity and richness whereas the Simpson dominance index for trees and shrubs was maximum in UF and UPF, respectively. The diversity of understory herbs were higher in CSF and UF. The maximum density of seedlings, saplings and poles were recorded in RF followed by DPF and UPF, whereas the minimum density was found in CSF. The tree C density (69.15 Mg C ha(-1)) was maximum in UF closely followed by RF; whereas the minimum was recorded in CSF (33.27 Mg C ha(-1)). The soil C density was maximum in RF (115.49 Mg C ha(-1)) and minimum in CSF (90.28 Mg C ha(-1)). Similarly, the maximum total ecosystem C density was recorded in RF (183.52 Mg C ha(-1)) followed by DPF (166.61 Mg C ha(-1)) and minimum in CSF (126.05 Mg C ha(-1)). Overall, UF management regimes were shown to have a greater capacity for C storage in vegetation, whereas strict FMRs, such as RF and DPF, were found to be more diverse and have a higher soil and ecosystem carbon density. The study established that in the midst of climate and biodiversity emergencies, it is urgent to maintain, protect and strengthen the network of RF and DPF FMRs for biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Kumar, Dhirender; Thakur, C.

Despite ever more marked deviations of leftist political platforms from the centralised model of the URSS, it is clear that self-management has not taken the place of central planning in Marxist plans for the future. In contrast, the author will come up with evidence that an analysis of the self-managed firm system may offer clues for a critical discussion of major points of Marxian theory, including the labour theory of value, alienation, dialectics or the subjectobject inversion in capitalism. Accordingly, in the individual sections of this paper each of these central aspects of Marxian theory will be separately addressed in the light of insights flowing from the economic theory of producer cooperatives.","Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, I-80132 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Jossa, B (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Via Mezzocannone 16, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",bruiossa@unina.it,,,,,,,111,5,5,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

While the cooperatives received a great deal of scholarly attention during the 1970s and 1980s, relative little has been published on recent developments at Mondragon. It is time to update the Mondragon story. In 1991, 100 cooperatives joined to become the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation. This super-structure has permitted an important degree of centralised control over member cooperatives. Yet it has also been the source of substantial challenges, both structural and ideological, to this alternative form of industrial organisation. We appear to be witnessing the cooperatives' decline, the end of a great experiment in favour of just another capitalist enterprise. This story is important both for cooperativism in Mondragon itself and for scholars and practitioners worldwide who find in Mondragon proof than an alternative, less exploitative approach to industrial organisation is possible.","Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Fac Business, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Harding, S (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Fac Business, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,23,AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL SOCIAL SERVICE INC,"DARLINGHURST,","LOCKED BAG 11, DARLINGHURST,, NSW 2010, AUSTRALIA",0157-6321,,,AUST J SOC ISSUES,Aust.

Improved prudential regulations and supervision capacity would promote overall banking sector soundness. The paper evaluates the actions needed to achieve such a vision, highlighting issues facing rural credit co-operatives (RCCs), state-owned commercial banks, and the potential role of development banks as well as current initiatives in creating complementary service providers. It outlines the capacity building efforts financial institutions will need to undertake and the reorientation of bank supervision functions that will need to occur.

Against these changing supply and demand relations, fresh produce suppliers are being asked to provide additional services and incentives in exchange for volume purchases and other commitments by buyers. The demand for such fees and services coincides with new modes of retailer operation. Necessary processes such as washing, sorting, packing and distributing products, provided either by third party logistics provider or by producers owning relevant facilities at their premises.

Extremism is modelled as a production factor whose effect on expected revenue is initially positive and then turns negative, and whose level is optimally chosen by a revolutionary organization. The organization is bound by a free-access constraint and hence uses the degree of extremism as a means of indirectly controlling its level of membership with the aim of maximizing expected per capita income of its members, like a producer co-operative. The gist of the argument is that radicalization may be an optimal reaction to perceived failure (a widespread perception in the Muslim world) when political activists are, at the margin, relatively strongly averse to effort but not so averse to extremism. This configuration is at odds with secular, Western-style revolutionary politics but seems to capture well the essence of Islamic revolutionary politics, embedded as it is in a doctrinal framework.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice POLIS, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ferrero, M (corresponding author), Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice POLIS, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",ferrerom@sp.unipmn.it,,,,,,,20,27,27,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2005,122,1-2,,,,,199,220,,10.1007/s11127-005-5792-2,0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,919VD,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000228644800010,0

It is well known that in the absence of regulatory mitigation the population density has a positive effect on broadband diffusion. Hence, we measure the effect of the population density on the determinants of broadband diffusion throughout the postal codes of Finland via Geographically Weighted Regression. We suggest that the main determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density follow a spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong strength or non-concentric convex/concave. Based on 10 patterns, we argue that the Finnish spectrum policy encouraged Mobile Network Operators to satisfy ambitious Universal Service Obligations without the need for a Universal Service Fund. Spectrum auctions facilitated infrastructure-based competition via equitable spectrum allocation and coverage obligation delivery via low-fee licenses. However, state subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract investment from nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies encouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber consumer cooperatives. To explain this emergence, we show that when population density decreases, the level of mobile service quality decreases and community commitment increases. Hence, we recommend regulators implementing market-driven strategies for 5G to stimulate local investment. For example, by allocating the 3.5 GHz and higher bands partly through local light licensing.","[Benseny, Jaume; Toyli, Juuso; Hammainena, Heikki] Aalto Univ, Dept Commun & Networking, Konemiehentie 2, Espoo, Finland; [Toyli, Juuso] Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Rehtorinpellonkatu 3, SF-20500 Turku, Finland; [Arcia-Moret, Andres] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, William Gates Bldg,15 JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge, England",Aalto University; University of Turku; University of Cambridge,"Benseny, J (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Commun & Networking, Konemiehentie 2, Espoo, Finland.",jaume.benseny@aalto.fi; juuso.toyli@aalto.fi; heikki.hammainen@aalto.fi; andres.arcia@cl.cam.ac.uk,"Töyli, Juuso/B-7305-2009",,EC H2020 RIFE project [644663]; project Network as a Service [EP/K031724/2]; project Network as SPARE [EP/R511675/1 NRAG/527]; EPSRC [EP/K031724/2] Funding Source: UKRI,EC H2020 RIFE project; project Network as a Service; project Network as SPARE; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors would like to thank Alexandr Vesselkov and Matti Kilkki for their valuable comments and discussions.

This article attempts to consider some of the theoretical and practical implications of this growing role by treating them as 'value-driven' organizations, and asking how this differentiates them, in terms of efficiency and accountability, from public or private agencies. It notes the lack of developed theoretical models capable of dealing with this question, and examines the relevance of existing theories (neo-classical economics, public administration and especially varieties of organization theory including the New Institutional Economics) in dealing with agencies which claim to be dominated by motivations based on democracy and altruism rather than self-interest. The author looks at problems associated with the measurement of efficiency and enforcement of accountability in organizational life and at the need for effective incentives and sanctions which provide a stable basis for maintaining commitment. He then considers the issues involved in the enforcement of accountability to ensure the efficient use of resources in producer co-operatives on the one hand and service delivery NGOs on the other. In the former, the focus is on the strengths and weaknesses of market competition and the costs of collective management; in the latter on the varied relationships between 'principals and agents' involved in the production and management of services.","UNIV SUSSEX,INST DEV STUDIES,BRIGHTON BN1 9RE,ENGLAND",University of Sussex,"BRETT, EA (corresponding author), LONDON SCH ECON,INST DEV STUDIES,HOUGHTON ST,LONDON WC1,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,,57,53,53,0,11,BLACKWELL PUBL LTD,OXFORD,"108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX4 1JF",0012-155X,,,DEV CHANGE,Dev.

We show that, when social ties in a community enhance borrowers' incentives to exert effort, a profit-maximizing financier chooses a group of limited size. Borrowers that would be fundable under moral hazard but have insufficient social ties do not receive funding. The result arises because there is a trade-off between raising profits through increased group size and providing incentives for borrowers with less social ties.

Several studies exist on the causes and effects of poor water quality, and on possible solutions for effluent control in these two economically important production systems. However, only a small number of Vietnamese farms apply these reduction options, raising questions over the state-enforced compliance with legislated water-quality measures. Voluntary standards and certification networks have recently emerged as alternative forms of water-quality governance in Vietnamese aquaculture. This paper examines a number of ongoing and interlinked international, national and community level initiatives on (voluntary) standards and certification that aim to promote sustainable shrimp and pangasius aquaculture in Vietnam. The results indicate the potential, but also challenges, in the development and implementation of national and international standards and demonstrate the need for more attention to the role of local institutions like producer co-operatives in multi-level governance arrangements.","[Pham Thi Anh; Bush, Simon R.; Mol, Arthur P.

We develop a model of `mixed credit markets' where pure for-profit institutions (e.g. commercial banks) can coexist with financial NPOs which feature a concern for inter-member surplus redistribution (e.g. credit cooperatives) and enjoy privileged borrower-specific information vis-a-vis their for-profit peers, while facing higher funding costs. We formally investigate market competition between the two alternative financial organizations both offering contracts whose terms entail cross subsidization. We argue that heterogeneity in organizational models can explain stable coexistence under competitive conditions, and also help us interpret the variety of market outcomes - in terms of e.g. overall coverage and market shares - as documented in modern financial systems. Importantly, the viability of redistribution-oriented NPOs is shown not to rest on under-investment issues or concerns about market power, for they can successfully operate in markets where credit rationing never arises.","[Sorge, Marco M.] Univ Salerno, Fisciano, Italy; [Sorge, Marco M.] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Sorge, Marco M.] CSEF DISES, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Amato, Marcello D.] Univ Napoli Suor Orsola Benincasa, Dept Law, CSEF, Naples, Italy; [Amato, Marcello D.; Pietro, Christian Di] CELPE, Naples, Italy; [Pietro, Christian Di; Pietroluongo, Mariafortuna] Univ Napoli Parthenope, DISAE, Naples, Italy; [Pietroluongo, Mariafortuna] CRISEI, Naples, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Gottingen; Suor Orsola Benincasa University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Sorge, MM (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Fisciano, Italy.;Sorge, MM (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.;Sorge, MM (corresponding author), CSEF DISES, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",marcello.damato@unisob.na.it; christian.dipietro@uniparthenope.it; m.pietroluongo@uniparthenope.it; msorge@unisa.it,,"Sorge, Marco Maria/0000-0002-8311-039X; D'AMATO, Marcello/0000-0002-5772-3897",,,,,57,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using data from 3150 farmers across all 26 Brazilian states, we tested the importance of four groups of variables in affecting adoption: farmer characteristics (age and education); farm characteristics (size and feedlot infrastructure); information networks (social networks and extension); and market incentives (export share and environmental risk). A logistic regression model found all eight variables to be statistically significant predictors of IS adoption. The two information network variables had the greatest impacts on IS adoption. This result demonstrates a central role for public agencies like EMBRAPA in developing and communicating new agricultural practices, as well as the role of producer cooperatives and associations in making information about IS technologies available to farmers.","[Perosa, Bruno] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Econ & Int Relat, Joao Naves de Avilla 2121,Bloco J1, BR-38408 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Newton, Peter] Univ Colorado, Sustainabil Energy & Environm Community, Environm Studies Program, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Carrer, Marcelo Jose] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Prod Engn, Rodovia Washington Luiz Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,"Perosa, B (corresponding author), Univ Fed Uberlandia, Av Joao Naves de Avila 2121,Bloco 1J, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",brperosa@ufu.br; peter.newton@colorado.edu; marcelocarrer@dep.ufscar.br,,"Newton, Peter/0000-0002-3992-0483; Carrer, Marcelo Jose/0000-0001-8511-2543",,,,,48,11,11,5,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JUL,2021,106,,,,,,,,105459,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105459,0,,,9,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RX9ZH,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000647574200002,0

The purpose of the study is to consider the process of selecting an information resource to meet the information needs of representatives of small agribusiness. The leading methods of the study are an abstract-logical method, the 5W + 1H formula set, as well as information theories, probabilities, and statistical methods. The paper proposes a multi-criteria model for selecting an information resource to meet the information needs of the representatives of small agribusiness within the framework of a specific request, depending on the characteristics of the formula 5W + 1H. The processes of assessing particular criterial functions and compiling the objective function of the model are also considered. The use of a multicriterial selection model is demonstrated on the example of the informational need of an agricultural agrotechnical consumer cooperative for updating the material and technical resources. The significance of the research topic is determined by the fact that in most cases for small agribusiness, information is the only resource (capital) at the initial stage of operation. More than that, the search process is hampered by the lack of the necessary level of qualification and information culture. The multi-criteria model of selecting an information resource can find its application both in scientific research of information needs and in modeling and development of information technologies for agribusiness.","[Kudasheva, Mariya S.] Penza State Technol Univ, Penza, Russia",Penza State Technological University,"Kudasheva, MS (corresponding author), Penza State Technol Univ, Penza, Russia.",msi1958.20@mail.ru,"Kudasheva (Afanasyeva), Mariya/A-9145-2015","Kudasheva (Afanasyeva), Mariya/0000-0001-8247-3714",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2367-3370,2367-3389,978-3-030-40749-0; 978-3-030-40748-3,LECT NOTE NETW SYST,,,2020,115,,,,,,130,138,,10.1007/978-3-030-40749-0_16,0,,,9,"Business; Development Studies; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BR2HM,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000637725800016,0

In situations in which individual and collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision. Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However, extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies, cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.","[Baldassarri, Delia] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Grossman, Guy] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Princeton University; Columbia University,"Baldassarri, D (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dbalda@princeton.edu,"Grossman, Guy/AAF-3940-2019","Grossman, Guy/0000-0002-6980-6390; Baldassarri, Delia/0000-0002-9264-035X","National Science Foundation [SES(IOS)-0924778, SES-0921204]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0924778] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful to Alexander Barnard, Eliana Horn, Sylvie Hoster, Vivian Lu, and our local team of interviewers for their research assistance.

Although finance inclusion can widen social and economic opportunities, the successful usage of microcredit depends on the costs (rates of interests) and on the methodology applied to grant credit. Hence, through a bibliographic review, the paper presents a comparative analysis of three remarkable experiences on microfinance. Firstly, the Brazilian Community Development Banks (CDB), inspired by the Grameen Bank and devoted to reaching the poor of the poor. Secondly, the programs applied by some Public Development Banks (PDB) in Brazil to foster entrepreneurship through microcredit. Third, the Italian Credit Cooperatives (BCC - Banche di Credito Cooperativo), essential in the provision of credit for small enterprises and households. Despite their peculiarities, there are some similarities in their governance and methodologies applied to grant credit. The local dimension, the relationship lending to capture soft information for risk analysis, and the purpose of serving the community providing financial services instead of generating and distributing profits are standard features. These experiences could inspire a proposal for microfinance expansion, based on the ground principles of mutuality, solidarity, cooperation, and localism.","[Goncalves De Oliveir, Andressa Jarletti] Pontifical Catholic Univ Parana PUCPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana,"De Oliveir, AJG (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Parana PUCPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",andressajarletti@hotmail.com,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,7,UNIV STUDI FIRENZE,FLORENCE,"C/O PROF F DESSI-FULGHERI, VIA ROMANA 17, 50125 FLORENCE, ITALY",2239-1118,,,CAMBIO,Cambio,,2020,10,19,,,,,59,72,,10.13128/cambio-8484,0,,,14,Sociology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Sociology,OI5NS,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000583325600005,0

Given the need for a sustainable steady-state economic system, some other form of business organization will likely be required that uses natural resource inputs more efficiently and is less growth oriented than the typical corporation. An attractive alternative is the producer cooperative, where employment is accompanied by a right to democratic participation in organizational governance and a share of surplus earnings. A comparative theoretical analysis of cooperative and profit-maximizing corporate behavior suggests that cooperatives will tend to use natural resource inputs more efficiently and will be less growth oriented than corporations. The limited comparative empirical research that is available supports the greater input efficiency of cooperatives relative to corporations. This same research suggests that in fully employed economies, cooperatives will be less growth oriented than corporations, although where unemployment is substantial the reverse is likely.

Hanseniaspora uvarum, Pichia kluyveri, Pichia caribbica and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the predominant yeasts in the three fermentations. Lactobacillus plantarum, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Bacillus cereus and Lysinibacillus fusiformis were the common bacterial species isolated from the fermentations. The PH 9 hybrid showed highest diversity of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria. Twenty-seven volatile compounds were identified during the cocoa fermentation of all hybrids. Chocolate from PH 9 hybrid had most desirable flavors and obtained the most ideal score in acceptance test. Chocolate from PH 15 hybrid was considered the most bitter, acidic and astringent. Chocolates produced by different cocoa hybrids showed differences in sensory attributes and acceptance. Therefore, special management is required for the different hybrid fermentations to obtain high-quality chocolate. Practical ApplicationsAs a solution to the recovery of the cocoa crop in Brazil, many hybrids resistant to the disease called witches' broom were developed, but the impact of these crosses on cocoa quality, consequently in chocolate is not known. The producers' cooperatives and farmers of cocoa have no technical or scientific information about the behavior of cocoa hybrids during spontaneous fermentation process, which, oftentimes give rise to an uncontrolled fermentation of cocoa hybrids mixture. The results of this paper could be used among the producers' cooperatives and cocoa farmers for guidance about the influence of genetic improvement on the quality of cocoa fermented beans and chocolates, particularly among the three hybrids evaluated in this study.","[Da Veiga Moreira, Igor Magalhaes] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Da Cruz Pedrozo Miguel, Maria Gabriela; Ramos, Cintia Lacerda; Duarte, Whasley Ferreira; Schwan, Rosane Freitas] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Efraim, Priscilla] Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Food Engn, Dept Food Technol, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Schwan, RF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Lavras, MG, Brazil.",rschwan@dbi.ufla.br,"Ramos, Cintia/G-6650-2013; Duarte, Whasley/P-5075-2019; Duarte, Whasley/F-7863-2010; Efraim, Priscilla/B-9487-2012; Schwan, Rosane Freitas/AAD-3253-2020","Ramos, Cintia/0000-0002-8096-2300; Duarte, Whasley/0000-0002-1027-588X; Duarte, Whasley/0000-0002-1027-588X; Schwan, Rosane Freitas/0000-0003-1320-8882; Efraim, Priscilla/0000-0003-4411-4731",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico of Brazil (CNPQ); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico of Brazil (CNPQ)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors thank the Brazilian agencies Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico of Brazil (CNPQ), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for scholarships, and Fazendas Reunidas Vale do Juliana (Igrapiuna, Bahia, Brazil) by collecting samples.",,35,18,19,0,33,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",0146-9428,1745-4557,,J FOOD QUALITY,J.

First, although heavily involved in administration, nevertheless managed to find time for fieldwork of this kind. The author contributed to ongoing fieldwork at the CEA, and his results were fed into the teaching through his contribution of interviews, work songs and other material for the Mozambican Miner, later published as Black Gold.

Based on the case of cooperative finance, this paper's outcomes are twofold. First, it shows that while the boundaries between the nature and property regime of goods may be relatively clear for natural common goods, they appear much more interlinked for human-made goods, where commons are embedded in intergenerational reciprocity. Second, it demonstrates that financial cooperatives can be understood as human-made commons and proposes a new way of thinking about public policies to design adequate legislation to protect these commons from isomorphism, privatization and destruction.","[PERILLEUX, Anais; Nyssens, Marthe] Univ Catholic Louvain, Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Périlleux, A (corresponding author), Univ Catholic Louvain, Louvain, Belgium.",Anais.Perilleux@uclouvain.be,,,Belgian Science Policy Office; AXA Research Fund,Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),The authors thank the participants to the fifth EMES Conference in Helsinki and the participants to the 32nd EGOS Colloquium in Naples for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Built by activists and NGOs, these systems were adopted by agribusiness. Such firms try to capture consumers and react to opinion campaigns, whilst appropriating the conservation (or 'fair') discourse. This leads to the rise of new forms of third-party certifications of food production based on private standards and, hence, to new forms of contract relations between producers and buyers. The nature of these relationships is not always evident in these new labels or in the discourse built to justify them. This is particularly so in the case of goods produced in the South to be traded and sold in the North, as the case of Starbucks illustrates. By the end of the 1990s, Starbucks, operating through an NGO called Conservation International (CI), arrived at the region of El Triunfo, in Chiapas, and contacted the producers' cooperatives that were trying to find a market for their product. Cl promoted Starbucks standards to raise the coffee quality and won the control over the production system. Meanwhile, the producers forced to sell their coffee through the largest trade company (AMSA) against whom the cooperatives were created, lost the control over their own organization. When some cooperatives refused the deal, they suffered divisions but could survive thanks the Fair Trade (FT) network in Chiapas.","Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Rural Sociol, Chapingo, Mexico",,"Renard, MC (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Rural Sociol, Chapingo, Mexico.",mcrenard@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,24,25,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

But new evidence shows that PR strengthens the left and redistribution, and we argue the standard view is wrong historically, analytically, and empirically. We offer a radically different explanation. Integrating two opposed interpretations of PR-minimum winning coalitions versus consensus-we propose that the right adopted PR when their support for consensual regulatory frameworks, especially those of labor markets and skill formation where co-specific investments were important, outweighed their opposition to the redistributive consequences; this occurred in countries with previously densely organized local economies. In countries with adversarial industrial relations, and weak coordination of business and unions, keeping majoritarian institutions helped contain the left.

However, in the course of the operation of microfinance companies, due to the lack of careful management and risk control, the problem of risk management has become increasingly prominent. The purpose of this paper is to study the microfinance risk based on polygenic artificial neural network, and it provides theory and practice application for risk management of microcredit enterprises. Taking the risk management of China's microfinance companies as the research object, on the basis of previous studies, this paper analyzes the risks of bank microfinance companies. Secondly, the basic theory of neural network model and its transformation function are introduced, and the learning method of neural network. At the same time, the learning algorithm of neural network and its improved algorithm are mainly introduced. It lays a theoretical foundation for the follow-up empirical research. Then, through the empirical study of data-based risk assessment of microcredit of farmers, the sample data are divided into training samples and test samples for comparison. Then, we use MATLAB software to establish a neural network model for farmers' microcredit risk assessment. Finally, in order to make the neural network model of farmers' credit risk assessment better popularize and apply, and effectively reduce the credit risk of farmers' microcredit. The corresponding policy suggestions are put forward, which proves the validity and applicability of the neural network in the field of farmers' microcredit risk assessment. It provides a good basis for rural credit cooperatives to identify the credit risk of farmers.","[Zhong, Xiong] Guangzhou Univ, Guangzhou Inst Int Finance, Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Sheng] Wuhan Donghu Univ, Sch Management, Wuhan 430212, Hubei, Peoples R China",Guangzhou University; Wuhan Donghu University,"Zhou, S (corresponding author), Wuhan Donghu Univ, Sch Management, Wuhan 430212, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhongxiong@gzhu.edu.cn; yushin@stu.cque.edu.cn,,"zhong, xiong/0000-0002-6501-1443",Projects of the Social Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (The research of financial support efficiency statistical measurement on industrial structural transformation in new normal economy) [GD16YYJ02],Projects of the Social Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (The research of financial support efficiency statistical measurement on industrial structural transformation in new normal economy),This work was supported by Projects of the Social Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (The research of financial support efficiency statistical measurement on industrial structural transformation in new normal economy) (GD16YYJ02).,,20,12,12,3,34,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

Design/methodology/approach This paper employs system GMM, dynamic panel data and traditional financial hypothesis framework to analyze bank performance and assess marketplace sustainability for a sample of commercial and cooperative banks from Costa Rica. In the assessment, the authors visit the relative market power, structure conduct performance (SCP) and efficient structure literature. Findings Market share (MS) is positively related to performance whereas the authors find a negative effect of market concentration (Herfindahl-Hirschman index) on bank profits, thereby refuting the SCP hypothesis. The authors accept the quiet life hypothesis within Costa Rican banks since a moderate level of profit persistence is detected. Commercial banks are less profitable. Yet when crisis is introduced to the models, it has a significant and negative impact on overall bank performance. Research limitations/implications The authors selected years and banks based on available data plus default information in the relevant database. More insights can be gained from post-2014 developments. Practical implications The current results and conclusions have implications for developing economies (and economic development, in general) by showing that the traditional understanding of cooperative bank model as better for the public good may not be necessarily true. They offer insight into the understanding of how different bank-type institutions affect the public good. Furthermore, expanding the research to Latin America in order to directly compare commercial and cooperative enterprises via a meta-frontier technique would help buttress this evidence. Originality/value This is the most recent study to provide such an investigation for a Latin American country with a sizable MS for cooperative and public sector banks. The paper offers analysis that has been limited in Latin American banking markets thus far.","[Doyran, Mine Aysen] Lehman Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Santamaria, Zachary Roman] CUNY, Grad Sch, Dept Econ, New York, NY USA; [Santamaria, Zachary Roman] CUNY, Univ Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Doyran, MA (corresponding author), Lehman Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.",Mine.Doyran@lehman.cuny.edu,,,Research Foundation of the PSC-CUNY Research Award Program of the City University of New York (CUNY); PSC-CUNY Research Award [60297-00 48]; PSC-CUNY Award [69392-00 47],Research Foundation of the PSC-CUNY Research Award Program of the City University of New York (CUNY); PSC-CUNY Research Award; PSC-CUNY Award,"The authors thank the Research Foundation of the PSC-CUNY Research Award Program of the City University of New York (CUNY) for its support.

Primary and secondary sources of data were used. Qualitative and Quantitative data types were collected from 385 respondents through interviews, focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and observations. The collected data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and econometric models. Crop productivity was analyzed by the Cobb Douglas model and its efficiency and determinants were identified by the stochastic frontier model. The major bottlenecks of crop production were the low attitude of farmers towards improved technology, low supply and usage of improved seed varieties (94.5%), low supply and use of fertilizers (95%), knowledge and skill gap of farmers (80.1%), poor extension service (57.3%), soil acidity (94.8%), diseases and insect pest (77.8%), conflict (84.9%) and the outbreak of human diseases (60%). Marketing challenges were poor infrastructure (87.3%), lack of market linkage (62.5%), and lack of credit services (70.6%). The Cobb Douglas model result revealed that land size, local seed, improved seed, repetition of weeding, and labor force influenced crop productivity. The mean level of crop technical efficiency was 51.3%. Education level, extension service, access to credit, cooperative membership, number of livestock owned, and soil fertility were influenced crop inefficiency negatively and distance to the farm was positively related to technical inefficiency. Improving extension services and skill of farmers through practical based training and building capacity of extension workers and systems to enhance the attitude of farmers towards technology usage and proper management practices, timely provision of farm inputs, improving road and market access, and provision of credit services to producers were some of the recommendations forwarded to alleviate crop production and marketing challenges in the study areas.","[Tadesse, Benyam; Tilahun, Yaregal] Mizan Tepi Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Dept Agr Econ, POB 260, Tepi, Ethiopia; [Bekele, Tilahun] Mizan Tepi Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Dept Hort, POB 260, Tepi, Ethiopia; [Mekonen, Getachew] Mizan Tepi Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Dept Plant Sci, POB 260, Tepi, Ethiopia",,"Tadesse, B (corresponding author), Mizan Tepi Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Dept Agr Econ, POB 260, Tepi, Ethiopia.",tadessebenyam7@gmail.com,"Tadesse, Benyam Worku/ABC-1621-2021","Mekonnen, Getachew/0000-0003-1385-3531","Southern Nation's Nationalities, People's Regional Government Special Support Office; Mizan-Tepi University","Southern Nation's Nationalities, People's Regional Government Special Support Office; Mizan-Tepi University","This work was supported by the Southern Nation's Nationalities, People's Regional Government Special Support Office and also MizanTepi University.",,72,12,12,0,2,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,JUN,2021,7,6,,,,,,,e07319,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07319,0,,JUN 2021,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,TK9NG,34195426,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-10-16,WOS:000674481000018,0

More than a case of trying to whitewash their malfeasance with fashionable and politically correct development-speak, I argue that the grassroots development apparatus its discourses, institutional forms, and practices became utterly instrumental to the illegal land seizures. Moreover, when operating alongside practices of land parcelization, iterative transactions, producers' cooperatives, and third-party intermediaries, grassroots development facilitated what could be called land laundering. In the process, grassroots development became a conduit for paramilitary-backed state formation in which projects of liberal governance commonly associated with the imperatives of institution building, good governance, and the rule of law became perversely compatible with the region's economies of violence. With the World Bank increasingly concerned over the conflation of fragile states, violent conflict, and alarming land grabs, this article raises questions about how the grassroots solutions currently being endorsed by the Bank can in some cases actually facilitate dispossession, illicit economies, and violent political projects. The way paramilitaries harnessed grassroots development also has critical implications for debates about post-development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

State interference in the functioning of financial institutions is necessary, especially for those of their types, whose bankruptcy may have fatal consequences for the welfare of the population and cause the liquidation of economic entities of the domestic economy. Among them are: banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and other institutions of credit co-operation, investment companies, in particular, joint investment institutions (unit and corporate investment funds), non-state pension funds, leasing, factoring, and other financial companies, pawns, etc. Therefore, it is expedient to consider the possibility of the influence of state regulators in financial services markets on the state of their participants' economic security. However, the study of the realities of the financial market of Ukraine development has made it possible to assert that for a number of financial institutions, the concept of economic security is something abstract, and the understanding by their top management the importance of economic security management, taking into account the negative market trends, is completely absent. So, the purpose of this study is to diagnose the level of financial institutions preparedness for the implementation of economic security management into their common system of management. The high level of financial market participants' readiness for safe-oriented management will allow regulators to rapidly implement in their practice a list of recommendations that will minimize the threat of bankruptcy and liquidation of domestic financial institutions. Methodology. In the process of preparing a scientific article, a great number of literary sources was considered. Some of them were developed using the method of theoretical generalization and the monographic method. The theoretical results presented in the research materials were obtained on the basis of the study of works of such scientists as Amadae S. M., Baily M. N., Elliott D. J., Ismail Z., Johnson K. N., Mirtchev A., Nelson J. A., Raczkowski K., Schneider F., Sidek Z. M., Ula M., Whalen C. J., Wierzbicka E., Yong J. To confirm the reliability of the scientific results presented in the article, the authors used the Delphi method and expert evaluation. The list of indicators for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of a mechanism for managing economic security in the following five areas is formed. These areas are: the availability and condition of the economic security system, the state of information and analytical support for the adoption of management decisions in the field of economic security, the state of intellectual and personnel management provision of economic security, reserves of financial support of economic security, the level of external influence on the state of economic security (state regulation and supervision). In May 2018, representatives of the top management of various types of financial institutions, scientists, researchers, and analysts who were interested in the issues of economic security management of the financial sector were interviewed. Their answers were analysed and the level of readiness for managing the economic security of the most common types of financial institutions in the financial market of Ukraine was determined. Using the graphical method, the obtained scientific results are presented in a convenient and understandable form for the perception of all interested persons. Results of the survey. The necessity of carrying out diagnostics of the readiness to manage economic security at the level of state regulatory bodies and at the level of top management of financial institutions in the near future is substantiated. A large-scale analytical work was carried out on determining the parameters of financial institutions readiness for the continuous and professional economic security management, which should be carried out with the use of a systematic approach. Based on expert opinions, a preliminary assessment of the various types of financial intermediaries' readiness to integrate security-oriented management into the financial institutions' common management system was made. Practical implications. The proposed methodological approach for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness to manage their own economic security should be used by the state regulators of the financial market, in particular, by the National Bank of Ukraine and the National Commission, which performs state regulation in the field of financial services markets, to monitor the activities of professional financial market participants in order to conduct advisory and consultative work with their owners and managers, as well as for the development of strategic guidelines for the provision of the state financial security. It is desirable to implement into the practical activities of financial intermediaries our proposals for increasing the readiness for implementation of the economic security management mechanism in the existing systems of management. Value/originality. For the first time, a scoring methodology was prepared for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of economic security management as an independent direction of management, and not as one of the tasks of other types of their management activity. At the theoretical level, the substantive interpretation of the notion of the readiness of financial institutions to manage their own economic security is proposed. The reasons for the impossibility of the modern financial institutions to manage their own economic security effectively are identified, and a few suggestions to minimize their number in the near future were made.","[Zachosova, Nataliia] Bohdan Khmelnytsky Natl Univ Cherkasy, Cherkassy, Ukraine; [Babina, Nataliia] Kyiv Natl Univ Technol & Design, Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Bohdan Khmelnytsky National University of Cherkasy; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Kyiv National University of Technologies & Design,"Zachosova, N (corresponding author), Bohdan Khmelnytsky Natl Univ Cherkasy, Cherkassy, Ukraine.",natazachosova@gmail.com; babinaamilo@gmail.com,"Babina, Nataliia/C-2981-2018; Zachosova, Nataliia/GRJ-8285-2022; Zachosova, Nataliia/S-5901-2017","Babina, Nataliia/0000-0001-9777-4827; Zachosova, Nataliia/0000-0001-8469-3681; Zachosova, Nataliia/0000-0001-8469-3681",,,,,16,0,0,0,2,BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES,RIGA,"VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA",2256-0742,2256-0963,,BALT J ECON STUD,Balt.

The credit-reporting platform promises to produce new and valuable knowledge about borrowers' creditworthiness and risk. But valuable in what ways and for whom? Private credit bureaus rely on vast arrays of personal and financial data in order to produce credit reports and consumer credit scores that claim to represent the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. Cooperative loan officers, instead, understand creditworthiness to be highly variable and rely on relational metrics in order to determine risk as well as carefully overseeing existing loans to ensure their timely repayment. Based on ethnographic fieldwork with loan officers at a small-scale credit cooperative in Lome, Togo, this article examines how the impending arrival of a private credit bureau and new credit-reporting technologies highlights the distinction between the ways in which credit bureaus and loan officers understand the nature of financial risk, as well as the centrality of loan officers and their management of borrower debt in sustaining the field of small-scale lending in Togo. Resume En 2015, la Banque centrale des etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest a choisi un etablissement prive de credit pour developper une plateforme numerique destinee a collecter et a analyser des donnees financieres dans les huit pays de l'Union economique et monetaire ouest-africaine, y compris pour les activites des cooperatives de credit et des institutions de microcredit auxquelles ont recours de nombreux emprunteurs ouest-africains. Cette plateforme de reporting du credit promet d'apporter des informations nouvelles et precieuses sur la solvabilite et le risque des emprunteurs. Mais precieuses en quelle maniere et pour qui ? Les etablissements prives de credit s'appuient sur un vaste eventail de donnees personnelles et financieres pour produire des rapports de credit et des scores de credit a la consommation qui affirment representer la solvabilite des emprunteurs individuels. Les charges de prets cooperatifs, quant a eux, conscients de la large variabilite de la solvabilite, s'appuient sur des metriques relationnelles pour determiner le risque et surveiller attentivement les prets existants pour s'assurer que les echeances de remboursement sont respectees. Base sur des travaux ethnographiques menes sur le terrain aupres de charges de prets d'une cooperative de microcredit de Lome (Togo), cet article examine comment l'arrivee prochaine d'un etablissement prive de credit et de nouvelles technologies de reporting du credit met en evidence la distinction les manieres dont les etablissements de credit et les charges de prets comprennent la nature du risque financier, ainsi que le role central des charges de prets et leur gestion de la dette des emprunteurs dans le maintien du secteur du microcredit au Togo.","[Opalo, Vanessa Watters] Northwestern Univ, Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60201 USA",Northwestern University,"Opalo, VW (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.",vwopalo@u.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0001-9720,1750-0184,,AFRICA,Africa,AUG,2022,92,4,,,,,625,643,PII S0001972022000353,10.1017/S0001972022000353,0,,,19,Anthropology; Area Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Anthropology; Area Studies,4Y8PT,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000861784900014,0

There is no change if costs and demand are given, unless the trade partner is a low-cost country. However, the scope for non-profit objectives is limited by the country's relative size if wages are market-clearing and if workers and firms are stationary, because of reduced competitiveness caused by higher real wage rates. The total surplus is then not affected by the actions of the SOE. International trade does not otherwise reduce the scope for its non-profit objectives if workers and firms are mobile, but productivity differences might require restrictions in order to avoid a complete relocation of the workforce in either country.","[Willner, Johan; Gronblom, Sonja; Kainu, Annina] Abo Akad Univ, Turku, Finland; [Flink, Johan] Stat & Res Aland, Mariehamn, Aland Islands, Finland",Abo Akademi University,"Willner, J (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Turku, Finland.",johan.willner@abo.fi,,,Society of Swedish Literature in Finland,Society of Swedish Literature in Finland,"Comments by participants in the XXXIX Kansantaloustieteen Paivat, Jyvaskyla, February 2017, and by Tom Bjorkroth, are gratefully acknowledged.

Using a long panel of Uruguayan firms, the author presents new evidence on firm survival by comparing WMFs with conventional firms. After excluding microenterprises and controlling for differences in the effective tax burden faced by the two types of firms, the hazard of dissolution is 29% lower for WMFs than for conventional firms. This result is robust to alternative estimation strategies based on semiparametric and parametric frailty duration models that take into account unobserved firm-level heterogeneity and impose a range of distributional assumptions about the shape of the baseline hazard. The higher survival rates of worker-managed firms seem to be associated with their greater employment stability. This evidence suggests that the marginal presence of WMFs in actual market economies cannot be explained by the fact that these firms are less likely to survive than conventional firms.","Univ Republica, Inst Econ IECON, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Burdín, G (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Inst Econ IECON, Montevideo, Uruguay.",gburdin@iecon.ccee.edu.uy,,,,,,,75,32,32,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0019-7939,2162-271X,,ILR REV,ILR Rev.,JAN,2014,67,1,,,,,202,238,,10.1177/001979391406700108,0,,,37,Industrial Relations & Labor,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AA3UB,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000331018500008,0

Recently, the application and implementation of FCLC in the Chinese micro finance bank has mostly relied on subjective judgment, and it is difficult to control and lower loan risk. In view of this, this paper is dedicated to researching and solving this problem by constructing the FCLC model based on improved particle-swarm optimization (PSO) and the multiclass, least-square, support-vector machine (LS-SVM). First, LS-SVM is the extension of SVM, which is proposed to achieve multiclass classification. Then, improved PSO is employed to determine the parameters of multiclass LS-SVM for improving classification accuracy. Finally, some experiments are carried out based on rural credit cooperative data to demonstrate the performance of our proposed model. The results show that the proposed model makes a distinct improvement in the accuracy rate compared with one-vs.-one (1-v-1) LS-SVM, one-vs.-rest (1-v-r) LS-SVM, 1-v-1 SVM, and 1-v-r SVM. In addition, it is an effective tool in solving the problem of loan-risk rating.","[Cao, Jie; Wang, Weiwei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hongke] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian] Jiangsu Jinnong Informat Co Ltd, Nanjing 210019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Southeast University - China,"Cao, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",kindcj@nuist.edu.cn; luhkseu@gmail.com,"Jinde, Cao/L-2658-2017",,"NSFC [60804047]; Science and Technology Project of Jiangsu Province, China [BE2010201]; Ministry of Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences Research Project [11YJCZH005]; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Philosophy, and Social Science Project [2010SJB790025]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Project of Jiangsu Province, China; Ministry of Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences Research Project; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Philosophy, and Social Science Project; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

This paper discusses the selected issues of corporate governance in the cooperative banking sector in Poland. It outlines the contemporary challenges of corporate governance principles in the Polish cooperative banking sector related to external and internal supervision of banking activity. In addition, this paper aims to answer the question whether and to what extent the Polish cooperative banks have adopted the recommendation of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority with regard to corporate governance in the banking sector and the extent to which internal rules for the organization of these banks affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the market. As a result, the following hypothesis was put forward: implementation of the corporate governance principles in the Polish cooperative banks has not contributed significantly to the improvement of their efficiency and has not enhanced the institutional supervision and internal controls in the cooperative banks. According to the authors, despite the existence of corporate governance principles in all Polish cooperative banks, there is still problem with the effectiveness of these institutions. Cooperative banks in Poland have experienced the phase of lethargy since 2013 and reported weaker and weaker financial results. Having in mind the fact that in 2015, that is after 14 years of stability in the sector, one of the Polish largest cooperative banks, SK-Bank, got bankruptcy, nobody predicted this event. It concludes that when it comes to the corporate governance principles the management bodies, regulators as well as supervisors require more effectively cooperation. The results in this paper confirmed that the model of credit cooperative movement adopted in Poland requires implementation of a couple of basic changes that are directly related to the utilization of the principles of a good corporate governance. The current corporate governance rules in Polish cooperative banks lead to having standardised governance without any substantial improvements and promoting better governance.","[Agnieszka, Alinska; Anna, Szelagowska] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Agnieszka, A (corresponding author), Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",aalin@sgh.waw.pl; aszelag@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,8,"NATL BANK UKRAINE, UNIV BANKING, KHARKIV INST BANKING",KHARKIV,"PR-KT PEREMOHY, 55, KHARKIV, 61174, UKRAINE",2306-4994,2310-8770,,FINANC CREDIT ACT,Financ.

While this type of organization has played an important role, not all of those organizations have survived over time. Using information from interviews with leaders of five longeval coffee producer cooperatives in the Huatusco coffee region, this study aims to identify the coffee cooperatives characteristics that can explain the longevity and long-term sustainability of these organizations. Additionally, using information from interviews, we evaluated challenges that could put at risk the long-term sustainability of these associations and strategies to overcome these challenges from the cooperative leadership perspective. Findings from this study suggest that motivations behind the creation of these producer associations go beyond accessing government resources. An institutional structure where there is a democratic process behind the election of leaders, leadership positions with predefined, not long, tenure terms, and association strategies to increase member engagement could explain the longevity of these organizations. Regarding challenges the cooperatives may be facing in the future, the aging population of growers is perceived by cooperative leaders as one of the major challenges they may be facing. Increasing youth involvement in the cooperatives through training and educational activities was perceived by cooperative leaders as a strategy to overcome this challenge.","[Velandia, Margarita; Trejo-Pech, Carlos; Stripling, Christopher] Univ Tennessee, 2621 Morgan Circle,301 Morgan Hall, Morgan Circle, TN 37996 USA; [Rodriguez-Padron, Benigno] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Ctr Reg Univ Oriente, Carreterra Huatusco Xalapa Km 6, Huatusco 94100, Veracruz, Mexico; [Servin-Juarez, Roselia] Colegio Postgrad, Campus Cordoba, Amatlan De Los Reyes 94953, Veracruz, Mexico",Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico,"Velandia, M (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, 2621 Morgan Circle,301 Morgan Hall, Morgan Circle, TN 37996 USA.",mvelandi@utk.edu,"SERVIN-JUAREZ, ROSELIA/D-2227-2014","SERVIN-JUAREZ, ROSELIA/0000-0003-3497-1609","University of Tennessee (Smith Center for International Sustainable Agriculture); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multi-State project [1020537]; Colegio de Postgraduados Campus Cordoba; Universidad Autonoma Chapingo (Centro Regional Universitario Oriente-CRUO)","University of Tennessee (Smith Center for International Sustainable Agriculture); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multi-State project; Colegio de Postgraduados Campus Cordoba; Universidad Autonoma Chapingo (Centro Regional Universitario Oriente-CRUO)","This study was supported by a seed grant from the University of Tennessee (Smith Center for International Sustainable Agriculture).

Access to financial services has allowed many low-income families to make significant progress in their own efforts to escape poverty. The government supports the growth of MFI services through many instruments, such as regulations, subsidy, and directed credit policies. Currently, there are two broad classification of microfince institutions in Indonesia, i.e., bank-MFIs such as BM's Unit Desas and rural banks (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat-BPR), and non-bank MFIs such as credit cooperatives (Koperasi), Islamic microfinance (such as Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, BMT), rotary-club saving (arisan), etc. As a business unit, the MFIs must follow the principle of efficiency to survive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of one type of the MFI in Indonesia, namely Syariahrural banks (BPR-S). The common approach to measure the level of efficiency of a business unit used by management is financial approach, such as ratio of operating expenses to operating income. However, economists normally use production function approach or its derivation to measure the efficiency. We are comparing the two approaches to evaluate the efficiency levels of the BPR-S. The results show that the efficiency levels of the BPR-S are generally operating in a good efficiency. Efficiently ratios of BPR-S during the sample period of time have been mostly above 90%. The efficiency based on the financial ratios confirms the finding from the production function approach. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach - Survey data used in this study is obtained by drawing a sample of 1902 farmers who are members of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives Union (ACCU) from 37 provinces of Turkey. Pearson's Chi-square test is used to analyze the association between the demographic features of farmers, conventional bank usage and Islamic bank usage. Binary logistic regression model is used to estimate the factors influencing the preference for Islamic banks. Explanatory variables include knowledge on Islamic banking and finance, perception of compliance to religion, saving ability and cost concern along with the control variables of Islamic bank branch number in the region and age of respondent. Robustness check is conducted via alternative models using ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression. Findings - Less than 10% of the participant farmers use Islamic banks and 59% declare they know nothing about Islamic banking. Age, education level, income level, nonagricultural income level, saving ability, duration of working in agriculture, land size and region are significantly related to farmers' preference of using Islamic banks. Knowledge level, perception of religious compliance, saving ability and cost concern are statistically significant factors that influence the probability of using Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications - This study does not include the analysis of the relationship between being religious and using Islamic banks because questions related to the assessment of religious practice were excluded due to the ACCU's sensitivity to investigate personal beliefs. Therefore, future studies can expand the scope of this research by investigating religiousness. The sample is chosen from the ACCU members who are already benefiting from a formal source of credit; therefore, the results should not be attributed to all farmers. Practical implications - Islamic banks and microfinance institutions' further engagement in the agricultural sector and ACCU's implementation of Islamic finance instruments. Social implications - Islamic banks' further diversification in the agricultural sector and ACCU's implementation of Islamic finance instruments. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the farmers' perception and preference of Islamic banking in Turkey. The sample size of 1902 is much larger and geographically diversified compared to studies in agricultural finance. This study will be valuable for the agricultural finance empirical studies in Turkey as well as an important addition to the emerging literature on Islamic finance.","[Bulut, Mehmet; Celik, Harun] Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University,"Bulut, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",profmehmetbulut@gmail.com,"Bulut, Mehmet/ABF-8687-2020","Bulut, Mehmet/0000-0001-5903-4721",,,,,67,1,1,2,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0002-1466,2041-6326,,AGRIC FINANCE REV,Agric.

The objectives of the study included; to describe the socioeconomic characteristics of broiler business owners, to analyse the effects of selected socio-economic characteristics of micro broiler business owners on the survival of micro broiler businesses in Calabar metropolis, and to analyze the marketing mix and managerial practices of business owners in Calabar metropolis. It made use of primary data obtained from a random sample of 112 micro broiler operators. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and Ordinary Least Square Multiple regression approach. The result of analysis revealed that micro broiler business ownership is almost evenly distributed among males 47.32 percent and females 52.68 percent; and that more than half (56.25 percent) of the respondents are within the age brackets of 36-45 years. The study also revealed that respondents had one form of formal education or the other with tertiary education accounting for 75.89 percent. On the survival/competitive advantage of micro broiler firms in the study area, the result of Ordinary Least Square analysis showed that output of broiler, flock size, business experience, mortality and extension contact significantly contributed to a firm survival in broiler business. The study revealed that firms applied some management practices and marketing mix activities in operating their businesses. The managerial practices adopted and their mean weights included; planning (M = 3.80), organizing (M = 3.47), directing (M = 3.80), coordinating (M = 3.63) and controlling (M = 3.91). Also, the analysis showed that the marketing mix practices adopted and their mean values were; product (M = 3.23), price (M = 3.04), place (M = 3.77) and promotion (M = 2.26). The study shows that micro broiler operators showed positive attitude to all the management function and marketing mix practices. The study recommended that micro broiler operators should organize themselves into cooperative societies to enable them enjoy the benefits of economies of size and credit facilities from lending agencies. It was also recommended that relevant extension services should be made available to broiler operators to improve their skills and knowledge in broiler business operations. Policy action of government should be directed towards capacity utilization of operators. Also, subsidies should be provided for cost of feeds and day old chicks as well as instituting a flexible credit policy to reduce cost of production.","[Ukpabuku, Joseph Ugah; Ben Ohen, Susan] Univ Calabar, Dept Agr Econ, Calabar, Cross River Sta, Nigeria",University of Calabar,"Ukpabuku, JU (corresponding author), Univ Calabar, Dept Agr Econ, Calabar, Cross River Sta, Nigeria.",joekpabs@yahoo.com; drsbohen@gmail.com,"Ohen, Susana/Q-3378-2019","Ohen, Susana/0000-0002-6463-7751",,,,,40,0,0,1,1,UNIV AGRONOMIC SCIENCES & VETERINARY MEDICINE BUCHAREST - USAMV,BUCHAREST,"59 MARASTI BOULEVARD, DISTRICT 1, BUCHAREST, 011464, ROMANIA",2284-7995,2285-3952,,SCI PAP-SER MANAG EC,Sci.

This Article presents a case study of a large worker cooperative in South India that has worked well for a long time. This cooperative illustrates, among other things, that worker control and worker democracy are not necessarily inconsistent with the degree of hierarchy and delegation that may be essential to effective operation. The cooperative has been able to compete despite paying wages and benefits that are dramatically higher than those paid by its competitors, while at the same time providing far better working conditions. How it has been able to do this is something of a puzzle. Part of the explanation is good fortune at its inception in attracting effective, honest, and dedicated managers and, subsequently, in avoiding government involvement and in being able to ignore cumbersome and unsuitable legal rules. Perhaps more important is the workplace culture and the ability to harness forms of mutual monitoring not available to competitors. At the end of the day, it is unclear how much of the success of the cooperative is a function of its cooperative nature and how much is a product of its unique circumstances. Still, the story of this enterprise offers useful lessons in the organization of economic activity, particularly in the importance of nonlegal mechanisms for maximizing individual cooperative productivity.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; Ctr Dev Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Gulati, GM (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,71,14,14,1,17,UNIV CALIF,LOS ANGELES,"SCH LAW 405 HILGARD AVE, LOS ANGELES, CA 90024 USA",0041-5650,,,UCLA LAW REV,UCLA Law Rev.,JUN,2002,49,5,,,,,1417,1454,,,,,,38,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,575HQ,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000176941200008,0

The major shortages caused by the vine disease phylloxera after 1875 forced merchants to search for new sources of supply, often in foreign countries or through the production of artificial wines. When domestic production revived, however, the recovery was not accompanied by a noticeable reduction in these new supplies, with the result that prices, as well as growers' profitability, fell sharply after the turn of the twentieth century, strengthening the merchants' power in the various commodity chains. To overcome this situation, growers in three very different wine-producing areas, namely the Midi, Bordeaux, and Champagne, used their political influence to achieve government intervention in order to control fraud and establish regional appellations or producer cooperatives, which helped them win back some of their market power from merchants.","Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Simpson, J (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,55,21,22,0,16,HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL,BOSTON,"BUSINESS HISTORY REVIEW, 60 HARVARD WAY, BOSTON, MA 02163 USA",0007-6805,,,BUS HIST REV,Bus.

The basic neoclassical model assumes that WMFs maximizes net income per member instead of total profits (Ward, 1958). Even though it has been largely criticized, the Ward model has dominated the self-management literature. Alternative models suggest that WMFs are not only concerned about income per worker but also about the level of employment. However, the empirical content of these competing theoretical models has been rarely analyzed. This paper contributes to fill this gap by estimating the parameters of a generic welfare function, following the methodology proposed by Craig and Pencavel (1993). These parameters determine the relative importance that a WMF places on income per worker vis-a-vis the level of employment. Estimates are based on a long micro-panel of Uruguayan firms covering the entire population of Uruguayan worker-managed firm and conventional firms in 31 3-digit sectors over the period April 1996-December 2005. Following a strictly neoclassical framework, but simply allowing a more general specification of the WMF goals, we show that the assumption of the basic neoclassical model of the WMF is misleading. Our results support the view that WMFs are concerned with both employment and income per worker. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This article explores, theoretically, the current challenges and opportunities for cooperatives to develop successfully in the globalizing economy. To this end, we provide an analytical, critical review of the key bibliography concerning some fundamental aspects that shape the relationship between economic globalization and cooperatives, an issue that has been generally neglected by previous literature. Three key fields are addressed: 1) the viability of cooperatives, based on their strengths and possible weaknesses, under current globalization; 2) the role of these organizations in promoting the local development and stability of local communities; and 3) the tensions and potentialities that internationalization entails for cooperatives. Based on the analytical review and the organization of the literature, we propose an agenda for further research. This includes some hypotheses and strategies for testing them that would be essential to assess the role of cooperatives in economic globalization, and sheds light on key areas for future research that could provide a better understanding of the complexity surrounding the relationship between globalization and cooperatives.","[Bretos, Ignacio; Marcuello, Carmen] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Bretos, I (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",ignaciobretos@gmail.com,", Carmen/HTR-2718-2023; Bretos, Ignacio/AAQ-5137-2021; Marcuello, Carmen/GMX-4468-2022","Marcuello, Carmen/0000-0003-1745-8037; Bretos, Ignacio/0000-0002-4941-2028","Aragon Regional Government; European Social Fund, S64 GESES-Research Group","Aragon Regional Government(Gobierno de Aragon); European Social Fund, S64 GESES-Research Group(European Social Fund (ESF))","This study is financed by the Aragon Regional Government and the European Social Fund, S64 GESES-Research Group.

To enhance food security in this context, participatory action research can help to ensure sustained success while considering entire food value chains (FVC). This paper assesses the feasibility and potential success of upgrading strategies (UPS) as well as their assessment criteria as developed by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists. The results form part of a larger participatory research project conducted in two climatically representative regions of Tanzania: semi-arid Dodoma and subhumid Morogoro. This paper presents the findings with respect to food processing, waste management and bioenergy, along with income generation and market participation. Assessments on other components of the FVC, including natural resource management, crop production and consumption, are reported by Graef et al (2015). The assessments for food processing revealed preferences for preservation techniques, oil extraction processes and food storage devices for the semi-arid region. In contrast, in the subhumid region, the experts favoured food storage devices and preservation techniques. Assessments of waste management and bioenergy UPS for both regions indicated the importance of animal feed from crop residues, crop residues as mulch and compost from food waste, although with somewhat different priorities. Assessments on income generation and markets in both regions revealed preferences for savings and credit cooperatives and communication techniques, but also indicated that warehouse receipt systems and guarantee systems had a high impact. Assessments differed between the two different climatic regions, and to some extent also between the nationality of experts and their gender. The authors therefore attach importance to integrating different South-North and female-male awareness in assessments among scientists. Moreover, local and/or regional stakeholders and experts should be involved in developing site-adapted UPS for enhancing FVCs.","[Graef, F.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Inst Land Use Syst, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Schneider, I.; Lana, M.; Schindler, J.] ZALF, Inst Land Use Syst, Muncheberg, Germany; [Hoffmann, H.; Sieber, S.] ZALF, Inst Socioecon, Muncheberg, Germany; [Fasse, A.; Kissoly, L.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Hannover, Germany; [Germer, J.

Consequently, a number of plans and programs have been proposed and implemented to bring about such development in Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro review of the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land reform of 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the population growth as evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production (1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further deteriorated. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable for agriculture, but only about 19% is cultivated. This suggests an underutilisation of land. Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and education which are essential to development have not been given due attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural technologies used by farmers have changed little in this century. Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most potent economic force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from the central government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total agricultural credit, fertiliser and improved seeds respectively go directly to socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5% of the total cultivated land and 4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises with credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting smallholders, has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in Ethiopia. Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no significant development of agriculture in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform.",,,"BELETE, A (corresponding author), UNIV NEW ENGLAND,DEPT AGR ECON & BUSINESS MANAGEMENT,ARMIDALE,NSW 2351,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,,0,12,13,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON,Agric.

An institutional approach",REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Collective Action; Institutions; Specific Product; Mountain cheese; Province of Trento,PROPERTY-RIGHTS,"Collective action for quality differentiation of food products linked to a territory is a long-term process. It is often hindered by a lack of understanding of multilevel institutional dynamics. This article aims at conducting a socio-historical analysis of the institutional context allowing the development of a specific cheese value-chain in the province of Trento (Italian Alps). Using Ostrom's institutionalist approach, we conducted a historical analysis of the formal and informal multilevel institutions. Our results showed that a subsistence economy prevailed between 1800 and 1950, which implied little commitment from the producers to build up collective organisations, despite government and church incentives. When the modernisation of agriculture started around 1950, it meant that the production could be intended for the market, which enabled the development of producers' cooperatives. The province became autonomous in 1948 and supported those local dynamics. Since then, we have observed an increasing level of trust among the different local actors and towards the provincial government. Since 2000, the valorisation of cheese specificity has become a central strategy to face competition at different levels. However, at the same time the production has undergone intensification. This leads to a loss of the link between product and territory. The future challenge is therefore to implement innovative institutional arrangements that allow a sustainable differentiation of cheese.","[Pachoud, Carine] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Pachoud, Carine] Cirad, UR Green, Campus Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier, France",University of Innsbruck; CIRAD,"Pachoud, C (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;Pachoud, C (corresponding author), Cirad, UR Green, Campus Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",carine.pachoud@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,3,IGA-ASSOC DIFFUSION RECHERCHE ALPINE,GRENOBLE,"14 BIS AVENUE MARIE REYNOARD, GRENOBLE, 38100, FRANCE",0035-1121,1760-7426,,REV GEOGR ALP,Rev.

Quality and riskiness of bank outputs are explicitly accounted for in the cost function and their impact on cost efficiency levels is evaluated. The results show that mean X-inefficiencies range between 13 and 15 per cent of total costs and they tend to decrease over time for all bank sizes. Economies of scale appear present and significant, being especially high for popular and credit co-operative banks. Moreover, the inclusion of risk and output quality variables in the cost function seems to reduce the significance of the scale economy estimates. Following Spong et al. ( 1995) a profitability test is undertaken that allows for the identification of banks that are both cost and profit efficient. The results suggest that the most efficient and profitable institutions are more able to control all aspects of costs, especially labour costs. Finally, the data are pooled to carry out a logistic regression model in order to examine bank- and market-specific factors that influence Italian banks' inefficiency. Confirming Mester (1993, 1996), inefficiencies appear to be inversely correlated with capital strength and positively related to the level of non-performing loans in the balance sheet. The analysis also shows that there is no clear relationship between asset size and bank efficiency. Finally, it is possible to infer that quoted banks seem to be on average more efficient than their non-quoted counterparts.","Erasmus Univ, Dept Finance & Investment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; Univ Essex, Dept Accounting Finance & Management, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; Univ Wales, Sch Business & Reg Dev, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Essex; Bangor University,"Molyneux, P (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Finance & Investment, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",p.molyneux@bangor.ac.uk,,"Molyneux, Philip/0000-0001-6210-7418; Girardone, Claudia/0000-0002-7347-7526",,,,,36,147,148,1,32,ROUTLEDGE TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Engagement pods are grassroots communities that agree to mutually like, comment on, share, or otherwise engage with each other's posts, no matter the content, to game Instagram's algorithm into prioritizing the participants' content and show it to a broader audience. I argue that engagement pods represent a response to the material conditions of platformized cultural production on Instagram, where proprietary curation algorithms wrest knowledge and control of the labor process from producers. Cooperative algorithm hacking of this sort, although quite distinct from traditional organizing strategies, responds to the coercive force of the threat of invisibility that necessitates constant data production. They represent a collective attempt to exert some control over their conditions of presence-to-others and, in so doing, combat precarity and protect wages in the field. In a post-industrial economy where traditional models of labor organizing have struggled to address the conditions of platformized cultural work, I argue that the unusual phenomenon of Instagram engagement pods represents an organic form of worker resistance that responds to the unique conditions of these workers.","[O'Meara, Victoria] Univ Western Ontario, Media Studies, London, ON, Canada; [O'Meara, Victoria] Univ Western Ontario, Media Informat & Technoculture Program, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"O'Meara, V (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Fac Informat & Media Studies, Rm 2050, London, ON N6G 1G8, Canada.",vomeara@uwo.ca,,"O'Meara, Victoria/0000-0002-0278-5222",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,61,64,65,3,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

The recent popularity of employee stock ownership plans and the appointment of union and pension fund representatives to several corporate boards has renewed interest in understanding whether employee ownership can make firms more productive and profitable. Few studies, however, have compared the performance of management-run, or ''conventional,'' firms with worker cooperatives. Existing studies usually compare the productivities of firms and workers in different industries. By examining conventional and worker-controlled firms in the same industry, Craig and Pencavel provide a better comparison. The authors analyze data on the inputs and outputs of Northwestern U.S. plywood product mills from 1968 to 1986. Their data contain observations on conventional, union, and worker co-op firms. From these data, the authors try to determine whether cooperatives can produce more output than conventional firms that use the same level of inputs. To determine this, the authors must control for differences in the scale and products of plywood mills. The authors begin by discussing how worker ownership is likely to affect the use and productivity of inputs. They also discuss factors that affect the formation and failure of cooperatives. The authors hypothesize that the availability, cost, and control of capital play key roles in the formation and continuation of cooperatives. The authors next compare output produced per worker, output produced per unit of capital, and output produced per unit of timber input. They find that cooperatives have greater productivity per unit of timber input but lower labor productivity. The cooperatives also operate at larger scales than conventional firms. Craig and Pencavel isolate the effects of scale and differences in factor usage by estimating multifactor production functions. These production functions control for differences in input usage, scale, factor and product prices, and business-cycle effects. Their estimates suggest that cooperatives have slightly better productivities than conventional firms. Output supply function estimates reveal that cooperatives have lower output price elasticities. This latter finding suggests that cooperatives smooth production more than conventional firms when demand unexpectedly changes. In other words, cooperatives are less likely to reduce inputs and output when plywood prices fall or to expand inputs and output when prices rise. Craig and Pencavel conclude that worker ownership does not have ''first-order'' consequences for the factor productivity of plywood product firms. Although they find that plywood cooperatives respond differently to demand and supply shocks, these responses do not seem to have much of an effect on firm productivity. The authors conclude by listing factors that affect the formation and survival of cooperatives in this and other industries.","STANFORD UNIV,STANFORD,CA 94305",Stanford University,"CRAIG, B (corresponding author), FED RESERVE BANK CLEVELAND,CLEVELAND,OH 44114, USA.",,,,,,,,21,49,49,1,17,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

In credit cooperative field, the presence of a gender diversity can qualify among the mutual aims and social sector should pursue. With reference to cooperative banks, the work aims to verify whether board gender diversity increases the creation of value for stakeholders, in terms of stakeholders global value added (shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, community and external environment). Design/methodology/approach - We propose an econometric approach based on OLS regression model; the econometric model adopted to test our research hypothesis take into account three dependent variables in order to measure the amount and the distribution of value created by each cooperative bank, like Global Value Added Index, HHI Index and GINI Index. Regarding the regressors in order to express the bank governance profile, the choice of variables is based on the results of the studies relating to bank governance-performance. Our model takes also into account other macro-economic control regressors. The model is tested on a sample of Italian cooperative banks. Originality/value - Previous studies on board gender diversity in cooperative banks are particularly limited as a result of limited information and opacity of this field. The existing studies are limited to analyses of the effects on performance of the separation between ownership and control or of the corporate and governance structures, neglecting the dynamics of gender diversity; recently, some authors have investigated the relationship between the composition of loan portfolios and the structure and membership of the boards of cooperative banks in Spain, without however considering the board gender diversity. Our work allows you to expand the knowledge on the issue of governance of cooperative banks. Our study proposes some indicators to assess the social and mutual performance of cooperative banks; it puts in evidence if board gender diversity may improve the amount and also the equity distribution of the value creation process to stakeholders' cooperative banks. Practical implications - The outcomes of the paper may indicate possible best practices with respect to bank governance in bad economic times. So the gender diversity in board cooperative bank may contribute to support better business performance and, specifically, the bank's ability to create and distribute finance customers characterized by a lower credit risk. Based on these results, some managerial implications are proposed.","[Boscia, Vittorio; Marchetti, Pietro; Stefanelli, Valeria] Univ Salento, Dept Econ Sci, I-73100 Lecce, LE, Italy",University of Salento,"Stefanelli, V (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Econ Sci, Via Monteroni,Complesso Ecotekne, I-73100 Lecce, LE, Italy.",,,,,,,,29,0,0,3,15,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,900,912,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000357265200068,0

Design/methodology/approach The study uses a panel data set of 419 firm-year observations of listed companies in Kenya covering the period 2010 through 2018. Data are collected from the annual reports and analysed using a generalized estimations equation model. Findings The results reveal that there is momentum towards newer reporting frameworks in Kenya with substantial IR and SR disclosures in their annual reports. The results also show that level of SR and IR disclosures is influenced by both agency-related factors (board gender diversity, audit committee independence, block ownership and the presence of foreign ownership). Additionally, institutional-related factors (regulatory pressure and promotional efforts of regulatory and professional bodies [reporting excellence awards]) influence the disclosures. Practical implications The results highlight that initiatives such as those led by the regulatory and professional bodies in Kenya are effective in motivating companies to enhance disclosures. Thus, regulators and professional bodies might need to continue and even intensify their efforts. These results have implications for further research as they show that SR and IR disclosures are influenced by similar factors. Social implications The study has the potential to contribute to the ongoing initiatives and discussions on the adoption of IR by firms in Africa as spearheaded by the African Integrated Reporting Council. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge, the study is, perhaps, the first to examine both SR and IR disclosures at the same study allowing comparison of the extent and drivers of the two disclosures. Moreover, examining the institutional-related factors in a single country has not been done in prior literature, and so this is an innovation.","[Injeni, Geoffrey; Mathuva, David; Mudida, Robert] Strathmore Univ, Business Sch, Madaraka Campus, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mangena, Musa] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham, England",Strathmore University; University of Nottingham,"Mathuva, D (corresponding author), Strathmore Univ, Business Sch, Madaraka Campus, Nairobi, Kenya.",dmathuva@gmail.com,,"Mangena, Musa/0000-0002-3005-8110",,,,,137,10,10,5,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1985-2517,2042-5856,,J FINANC REPORT ACCO,J.

In Africa, as elsewhere, inequalities persist between women and men in terms of access to and control over resources and opportunities. ILO provided insight into the inequality in unemployment based on gender. In employment, women are found more often than men in informal and precarious work, with particularly pronounced imbalances in some sectors (ILO, Geneva 2002). The critical importance of closing gender gaps - which are not only contrary to the realization of women's rights, but also an obstacle to poverty reduction - is widely recognized. The report on the State of Food and Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) shows, for instance, that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase farm yields by 20-30 per cent, raising total agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5-4 per cent, which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17 per cent (FAO, Rome 2011). For women, who due to gender-based norms often have lower access to and control over economic and social resources and opportunities, cooperatives present distinct advantages. According to Argawal, women participation in cooperatives has its own advantages. Apart from being able to access economies of scale as providers of services, producers or as consumers, participating in a cooperative as a member, elected leader or manager also brings with it enhanced status and voice in the community and society in general (Argawal 2001). Given that there is insufficient research data on gender issues in Cooperatives, and in particular the participation of women in Leadership roles, KUSCCO in collaboration with the Cooperative University of Kenya conducted an qualitative empirical research that focused on co-operatives under the umbrella of the Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives (KUSCCO) and explored initiatives that KUSCCO has put in place in promoting gender integration in them and recommended strategies for enhancing gender balance.","[Gicheru, Esther] Cooperat Univ Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mtongolo, Jacqueline] KUSCCO Ltd, Res & Consultancy, Nairobi, Kenya",Cooperative University of Kenya,"Gicheru, E (corresponding author), Cooperat Univ Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya.",esthergicheru@gmail.com; jmtongolo@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2048-9021,,978-1-911218-64-7,PROC CONF EUR MANAG,,,2017,,,,,,,124,130,,,,,,7,"Business; Psychology, Applied; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Psychology,BJ4QG,,,,,2023-10-16,WOS:000425331200015,0
