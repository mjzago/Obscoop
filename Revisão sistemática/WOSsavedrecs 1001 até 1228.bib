Abstract = {The retail business is exposed to threats resulting from the tight
   competition mainly on the FMCG market, but it also has opportunities in
   the form of various types of cooperation and business management. One
   such example are the measures adopted by consumer cooperatives in the
   Czech Republic (the COOP Group). Worthy of attention and a thorough
   analysis are mainly the opportunities in the following areas: joint
   purchasing using a procurement center, store chain system and services
   offered in stores.},

Title = {Between technocracy and democracy: An experimental approach to
   certification of food products by Japanese consumer cooperative women},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {130-140},

Abstract = {Voluntary food certification systems have emerged as a prominent
   mechanism of food governance in recent years. However, critics have
   exposed certifications' inability to secure independence, quality,
   consumer trust, and costs. Recent criticism is even more pointed in that
   some theorists have critiqued ``alternative{''} systems such as Fair
   Trade as neoliberal window-dressing. What is curious about this emerging
   literature is how little has been said about the role of citizens.
   Although most of the certification literature has assumed that food
   certification resides in the exclusive realm of ``experts{''} and that
   technical sophistication is equated with improvement, I argue that
   democratization is possible and desirable. This paper draws on a case
   study of a Japanese consumer cooperative which has conducted a
   laywomen's food certification system for past ten years. By proposing at
   least two parameters of evaluation of food certification-redistributive
   effect and the degree of democratization, the paper expands the
   imaginary of ``politics of the possible{''} in food governance while
   acknowledging tension of gendered participation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Hollowed out Heartland, USA: How capital sacrificed communities and
   paved the way for authoritarian populism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {505-517},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Communities prosper when they are able to appropriate the wealth they
   produce and their institutions make peoples? lives meaningful. They
   wither when the institutions that permit this weaken or vanish.
   Sacrifice zones ? abandoned, economically shattered places, with growing
   social and health problems ? are spreading in historically white rural
   areas and small towns across the United States. Rural decline, rooted in
   economic restructuring and financialization, causes severe stress,
   exacerbates racial resentment, and creates a breeding ground for
   regressive authoritarian politics. A multidimensional approach must
   analytically connect long-term and recent trends affecting economy and
   livelihoods, institutions, health, and community life. The ?racial
   resentment? and ?economic distress? explanations for authoritarian
   populism are inextricably connected. Since the 1980s, and in intensified
   form after the 2008 financial crisis, capital has systematically
   undermined the institutions ? mutually-owned banks, credit unions,
   mom-and-pop businesses, family farms ? that fostered reinvestment of
   locally-produced wealth, especially but not only in rural areas. While
   many Trump voters were affluent suburbanites, another important sector
   of supporters consists of downwardly mobile inhabitants of zones where
   financialization and austerity destroyed the institutions that earlier
   allowed people to appropriate the wealth that they produced and where
   the social safety net, always fragile, is increasingly in tatters. The
   United States now has a poor and near-poor majority. Scholars and the
   media have underestimated the human toll of this crisis and the
   interconnectedness of the multiple processes of social decomposition
   affecting rural zones.},

Abstract = {Data envelopment analysis is used to measure the technical and scale
   efficiency of the domestic taste management function in 103 New South
   Wales local governments. After allowance is made for nondiscretionary
   environmental factors that may affect the provision of these local
   public sen,ices, such as congestion and the inability to operate
   machinery in densely populated urban areas, comparison of efficiency
   across geographic/demographic criteria is made. The results suggest
   that, on average, waste management inputs could be reduced to just over
   65\% of the current level based upon observable best-practice, while
   productivity losses due to scale effects account for slightly, over 15\%
   of total inputs. The results also indicate that inefficiency in urban
   developed councils is largely the result of congestion and other
   collection difficulties encountered in densely populated areas while
   inefficiency in regional and rural councils stems from an inability to
   attain an optimal scale of operations.},

Abstract = {Despite popular belief that timely and precise data are important and
   indispensable to good decisions and that good decisions are related to
   better firm performance, empirical research that examines the effect of
   data quality on firm performance is still scarce. How great an impact
   does data quality have on firm performance? This study empirically
   investigates the effect of firm-level data quality on firm performance
   in the Korean financial industry during 2008-2010. The results show that
   commercial banks have high-quality data, while credit unions have
   comparatively low-quality data. They also show that better data quality
   has a positive influence on sales, operating profit, and value added.
   Improving the level of data quality management maturity by one can
   increase firm performance by 33.7 \% in sales, 64.4 \% in operating
   profit, and 26.2 \% in value added.},

Abstract = {The potential of community fundraising in the villages through
   microfinance is actually very large, the through of institution of
   informal and semi-formal microfinance that is managed by the community
   itself, such as: credit unions, womens microfinance groups, grameen
   banks and ``arisan{''} or ``jula-jula{''} (the local tradition of
   micrifinance). The influence of microfinance so far is still limited to
   help the community in overcoming the risk of relative vulnerability
   level and small business activity in the scale is still very limited.
   Claims on the success of the microfinance program as a model of village
   development and helping the poor from the poorest are not proven. The
   position of microfinance has not been able to speak much; its influence
   is still very small in the rural development proces t in the village.
   Management of the microfinance institutions is still limited to small
   groups that are separate and have not been able to be assembled into a
   larger and stronger group at the village level with a wide range.},

Title = {Co-Operation among Irish Beef Farmers: Current Perspectives and Future
   Prospects in the Context of New Producer Organisation (PO) Legislation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Irish beef farms have experienced poor viability longitudinally, with
   industry and policy actors citing `crisis' levels in 2013. A crucial
   differentiator between the beef sector and the dairy sector, which has
   higher farm incomes, is well-developed infrastructure of farmer-owned
   dairy processing and marketing co-operatives. To address the lack of
   representative farmer organisations and power imbalances in the beef
   supply chain, in 2016 the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine
   (DAFM) legislated for the establishment of beef Producer Organisations
   (POs), facilitating beef producers to collectively strengthen their
   market positioning. While PO legislation is a significant development in
   potentially enabling supply chain integration of farmers, how the
   legislation is operationalised by Irish beef industry stakeholders will
   ultimately shape the nature and breadth of engagement with the PO model
   and, consequently, the impact of the legislation. In a context where
   there is little or no prior experience of such organisations in the beef
   sector, this paper presents an analysis of current stakeholder views in
   relation to the establishment of POs. Research involved a desk based
   review of the submissions made during the consultation period for the
   beef PO legislation and interviews with key informants in the Irish beef
   industry. We analysed Irish stakeholders' views through the lens of
   lessons learned from the existing literature on how POs operate
   internationally. Results indicate some stakeholders' perceptions of the
   need for a nationally coordinated approach in the establishment of an
   Association of POs, which concurs with the literature. However,
   stakeholders have not emphasised the benefits of Interbranch
   Organisations (IBOs), which involve vertical collaboration with other
   chain actors such as processors and retailers, an approach that has
   proven successful internationally. Nor have Irish stakeholders
   identified the potential of differentiating or premiumising beef
   products, which, according to international evidence, is necessary for
   improving profitability and farm-level incomes. Stakeholders identified
   the main threats to the future success of POs in Ireland as members'
   lack of commitment and processors' lack of willingness to engage with
   POs.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the current state of seed politics in Turkey
   focusing on the recent appropriation and commercialization of a wheat
   landrace, Karakilcik bugdayi (black-awn wheat) in Seferihisar, a small
   coastal town in the Aegean. It lays bare the long-drawn-out, often
   arduous but politically innovative processes that brought together
   various stakeholders, including the local municipality, a seed
   preservation centre, producer cooperatives, and urban-based alternative
   food networks. This paper argues that institutional mechanisms with
   strong grassroots support have the potential to weave together
   small-producer initiatives and disparate consumer interests and imbue
   them with the power to transform national agriculture and food politics.},

Abstract = {How do Canadian banks integrate environmental risks into corporate
   lending and where are they located compared with their global peers? In
   this paper we report a mixed method analysis of the integration of
   environmental risks into the credit management. The qualitative and
   quantitative analyses suggest that all analyzed Canadian commercial
   banks, credit unions and Export Development Canada manage environmental
   risks in credit management to avoid financial risks. Some of the
   institutions even connect environmental and sustainability issues with
   their general business strategies. Compared with other countries,
   Canadian banks are best in class, as all six Canadian commercial banks,
   comprising over 90 percent of Canadian assets, systematically examine
   environmental risks for credits, loans and mortgages. We conclude that
   Canadian banks are proactive regarding environmental examinations of
   loans and that there is a need for a more accountancy related reporting
   on environmental risk management in financial institutions. Further
   research is needed to be able to calculate costs and benefits of
   integrating environmental and sustainability issues into the credit risk
   management. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP

Abstract = {This article investigates whether branch network expansions by Japanese
   regional banks influence their management performances positively at a
   time when management environments surrounding regional financial
   institutions have become increasingly severe due to the population
   decreases and shrinkage of regional economies. Specifically, the effects
   of numbers of regional bank branches on their credit businesses and
   profits are empirically examined. The results indicated that regional
   banks with more branches can increase their loans and bills discounted
   as well as their small and mid-sized enterprises loans and bills
   discounted. Thus, establishing more branches is effective in increasing
   the total sum of loans and bills discounted by each bank because
   regional banks with many branches can make contact with more customers.
   On the other hand, return on assets and return on equity of regional
   banks with more branches were found to be lower. Therefore, regarding
   the cost performance of regional banks, establishing too many branches
   and maintaining branch networks that are too large can have negative
   effects on regional banks.},

Title = {Impact of savings and credit co-operative societies' services on
   household livelihood outcomes in Mwanza and Tabora rural areas, Tanzania},

Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Purpose This study investigates whether Savings and Credit
   Co-operatives' (SACCOS) services such as loans, savings and training
   improve household livelihood outcomes. Design/methodology/approach The
   study employed a quasi-experimental design. Six SACCOS were purposively
   selected in four districts of Mwanza and Tabora regions in Tanzania. A
   sample of 500 respondents was randomly selected of whom 200 were SACCOS'
   members and 300 were non-members. A questionnaire and a key informant
   interview guide were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data
   respectively. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to analyse the
   quantitative data whereas qualitative data was subjected to thematic
   analysis. Findings The results indicate that SACCOS' services had
   significantly impacted on the household livelihood outcomes in terms of
   maize yields, household assets, savings, food expenditures and non-food
   expenditures. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted
   in two regions of Tanzania using six SACCOS. Similar studies can be
   conducted in a larger area of Tanzania by capturing more than six
   SACCOS. In addition, the study focused on the rural areas of Tanzania.
   The future studies can be carried out in urban areas or both urban and
   rural areas of Tanzania. Practical implications Local leaders, SACCOS'
   leaders and other stakeholders in the study area should thus mobilise
   non-members in their areas to join SACCOS. In addition, the Tanzania
   government should facilitate the formation of new SACCOS and strengthen
   those already operating in rural areas. Social implications SACCOS
   provide opportunities for individuals and households in rural areas to
   converge socially and economically to achieve better results (positive
   impact on livelihood outcomes), which otherwise could be non-achievable
   through single household or individual efforts. Originality/value Unlike
   previous studies, this study provides empirical evidence on the impact
   of SACCOS' services on livelihood outcomes of SACCOS members in rural
   areas of Tanzania where abject poverty is widespread and where the
   majority of SACCOS are found.},

Title = {Antecedents of the Management Control System in Credit Cooperatives in
   Southern Brazil},

Abstract = {Objective: Considering the turbulent economic environment as well as the
   peculiarities of the operations conducted by cooperative entities, this
   study sought to analyze the connections between strategic risks and
   uncertainties and the use of the Management Control System (MCS) by
   credit cooperatives in Brazil's South region.
   Method: This is a quantitative study, conducted as a survey with a
   sample of 57 credit cooperatives. The data was analyzed through
   Structural equation modeling, with partial least square estimation on
   SmartPLS 3.0 software. The strategic risk and strategic uncertainty
   constructs were analyzed in relation to their connection with Simons'
   Levers of Control (1995), which contemplates the beliefs and boundary
   controls and interactive and diagnostic control systems. Furthermore,
   the connections between the four Levers of Control are also analyzed.
   Originality/Relevance: The study covers the antecedents (strategic risks
   and uncertainties) of MCS use, contemplating different compositions of
   type and class in credit cooperatives, taking previous studies into
   consideration, as well as covering a singular and pertinent region in
   the context of Brazilian credit cooperatives.
   Results: Strategic risk is not associated with the use of the Management
   Control System. Strategic uncertainty was proven to be the element that
   receives the most importance from managers in the process of using the
   four Levers of Control. Regarding the beliefs system construct, its
   importance is positively linked to the interactive control system, as
   also occurs with the connection between the interactive control system
   and the diagnostic control system.
   Theoretical/Methodological contributions: The study demonstrates the
   pertinence of the Levers of Control for credit cooperatives, inserted in
   the context of strategic risks and uncertainties. Social/management
   contributions: The findings bring about relevant contributions by
   proving that the balanced use of the four Levers of Control is relevant
   for promoting the strategic renovation of credit cooperatives,
   especially regarding strategic uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The authors investigate the employee features that, alongside overall
   voice expression, affect supervisors' voice recognition. Drawing
   primarily from status characteristics and network position theories, the
   authors propose and find in a study of 693 employees from 89 different
   credit union units that supervisors are more likely to credit those
   reporting the same amount of voice if the employees have higher ascribed
   or assigned (by the organization) status-cued by demographic variables
   such as majority ethnicity and full-time work hours. Further,
   supervisors are more likely to recognize voice from employees who have
   higher achieved status-cued by their centrality in informal social
   structures. The authors also find that even when certain groups of lower
   status employees speak up more, they cannot compensate for the negative
   effect of their demographic membership on voice recognition by their
   boss. The authors underscore how recognition of employee voice by
   supervisors matters for employees. It carries (mediates) the effects of
   voice expression and status onto performance evaluations 1 year later,
   which means that demographic differences in the assignment of credit for
   voice can serve as an implicit pathway for discrimination.},

Abstract = {It is essential to construct the scientific risk early-warning
   indicators system in order to prevent and control the risk from Rural
   Credit Cooperatives (RCC). Based on the theory of Entire Risk Management
   (ERM) and the risk management experiences from the international
   financial institutions, combined with the real Situation of China Rural
   Credit Cooperatives, this paper designs risk early-warning indicators
   system aimed at RCC. This system is composed of capital adequacy risk,
   credit risk, liquidity risk, profitability risk, operational risk and
   marketing risk. Each layer of sub-risk is assessed by some specific
   indicators. Furthermore, this paper theoretically discusses the single
   indicator early-warning model and comprehensive risk early-warning
   model.},

Abstract = {Children's savings accounts (CSAs) have emerged as a promising
   intervention to improve educational outcomes, curtail rising student
   loan debt, and promote equality of opportunity. Numerous localized CSA
   programs have emerged in the last decade, and many are embedded within
   school systems. This study leverages novel data to investigate
   participation in one of the oldest and most well-known CSA programs in
   the country: the San Francisco Kindergarten to College (K2C) Program in
   the San Francisco Unified School District. Spatial analysis of 21,617
   accounts at 74 elementary schools reveals statistically significant
   differences in the rates of elementary schools' K2C account
   participation based on the concentrations of banks, credit unions, and
   alternative financial service providers-net controls for neighborhood
   demographics. Unless explicitly addressed, substantial variations in the
   financial service environment across neighborhoods could undermine
   participation in school-based CSA programs for the very children these
   programs intend to support.},

Abstract = {The cooperative society plays significant roles towards the economic
   development in Malaysia. It was first established in 1922 to protect the
   welfare of rural people and has expanded its establishment until today.
   With the aim to help its members, it is said that cooperative needs to
   accelerate its performance. However, there are issues regarding its
   weaknessess, especially in the management, financial and members'
   participation. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors
   influencing its performance through strategic planning and members'
   participation. Questionnaires constructed have been distributed among
   cooperatives board members in Kota Setar District, Malaysia. The
   findings provide guidance for the cooperative to improve its
   shortcomings performance towards realizing the National Cooperative
   Policy 2011-2020. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The implementation of state programs for agricultural support provides
   for the development of agricultural cooperation in the regions as the
   basis for the rural territory development. Taking the latest global
   trends into account, only organizations that produce high-quality,
   organic food can become the basis of agricultural cooperation capable of
   giving an efficient impetus to the territory development-not single
   organizations, but rather a system of agricultural consumer cooperatives
   (ACCs) that provide storage, processing and marketing of finished
   products in cooperation with the small-scale agricultural sector
   (private subsidiary farming (PSF) and family (farm) enterprises F(F)E),
   as well as agricultural organizations that are the main producers of raw
   materials with modern qualified management, the support of local
   authorities, regional and federal authorities. In reality, most of the
   rural population, small and medium-sized organizations are not ready for
   new investments because they have no own funds but only old loans.
   Beginning farmers also lack sufficient funds for their further
   development, even with the help of a selective state support represented
   as Novice Farmers and Family Farms grants, as well as subsidies for
   technical equipment. This requires new mechanisms and methods of the
   state support for the creation and operation of ACCs, as well as
   intensive involvement of non-agricultural businesses with competences in
   commerce, logistics, marketing and other skills not typical for
   agricultural producers in the agricultural cooperation system on the
   basis of grant support for investment projects.},

Abstract = {Traditional cereal crop production is uneconomic, and diversification in
   cropping system is necessary in mountain regions. A pilot project was
   introduced on medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) cultivation with
   semi-processing and market strategy. Fast growing MAPs with high
   economic potential were given priority. A cooperative society was
   organized for quality control and proper marketing. Farmers got
   additional income with sale of MAPs that could improve socioeconomy. In
   the depressing scenario of the deteriorating farming condition, emerging
   experience of MAPs farming give hope for better living standard of
   mountain peoples. Cultivation of economically viable MAPs can improve

   is co-constituted through `friction' in the `contact zone' where local
   kinship relations and audit practices meet and grapple. Focusing on the
   `contact zone' allows us to better understand the everyday organizing
   that produces hybridity. We build on existing work on hybridities in
   organizations which predominately focus on issues of language and
   knowledge by focusing on the organizational interactions themselves,
   especially the embedded interactions between humans and objects. Seeing
   these interactions as `friction' means not trying to solve or dissolve
   them - but to acknowledge them as lived realities of an Indigenous
   organization.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the credit risk of firms in the social economy sector
   presents a considerable challenge, since it is difficult to calculate
   ratings with traditional methods such as logit or discriminant analysis,
   due to the relatively small number of firms in the sector and the low
   default rate among cooperatives. This paper introduces a goal
   programming model to overcome such constraints and to successfully
   manage credit risk using economic and financial information, as well as
   expert advice. After introducing the model, its application to a set of
   Spanish cooperative societies is described.},

Abstract = {The authors explored the role of attributions in shaping employees'
   trust in their managers in the context of negative events. The authors
   examined how 2 forms of managerial trustworthy behavior (open
   communication and demonstrating concern for employees) and
   organizational policies relate to attributions, trust in the manager,
   and organizational citizenship behavior. Participants were 115 credit
   union employees who responded to a critical incident regarding a
   disagreement with their managers. As hypothesized, trustworthy behavior
   was negatively related to attributions of personal responsibility for
   negative encounters, and this relationship was stronger when human
   resource policies were perceived as unfair. Managerial trustworthy
   behavior was also positively related to trust in the manager and
   organizational citizenship behavior. Personal attributions partially
   mediated the relationship between trustworthy behavior and trust.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},

Abstract = {New governance arrangements for NHS Foundation Trusts (FTs) aimed to
   replace centralized state ownership of acute English hospitals with a
   new form of social ownership. Under this, trusts would exist as
   independent public interest organizations on the model of mutuals and
   co-operative societies. Assessing the impact of the new arrangements on
   the management structure of four acute hospitals, we demonstrate that
   FTs have failed to deliver social ownership and local accountability on
   this model. We suggest that policy-makers should re-frame the governance
   apparatus associated with mutualism and social ownership in terms of the
   concept of meta-regulation. By re-framing governors as meta-regulators,
   regulatory institutions would acquire new powers to steer FTs towards
   sustainable forms of compliance via non-coercive, non-intrusive means.},

Title = {Collective strength and mutual aid: Financial provisions for members of
   co-operative societies in Britain},
Journal = {BUSINESS HISTORY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {54},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {925-944},
Abstract = {Notably one of the principles most prominently associated with Rochdale
   Co-operation is the system of paying dividend, a rate of return based on
   purchases rather than capital holding. This article argues that the
   dividend, though important, was only one aspect of financial assistance
   co-operative retail societies offered their members. By focusing on the
   period of the 1920s-40s, it explores how collective strength and mutual
   aid provided by societies extended to financial support during periods
   of economic crisis and industrial action. Credit in times of need was
   especially important for members of societies affected by trade
   depression, industrial crisis and unemployment during the interwar
   years. The article also argues that membership could give access to much
   wider support than is typically associated with the retail aspect of
   co-operative societies. For example, societies assisted individual
   members, or the families of members, during periods of illness and
   death. The article highlights how, as trading organisations, the spirit
   of mutual help within co-operative retail societies incorporated an
   element of collective expenditure. In addition to providing support for
   hospitals located in the communities in which they traded, societies
   also offered financial aid to nationally recognised charities. In this
   way financial assistance and support provided through the co-operative
   business model was not solely focused on extending the purchasing power
   of individual consumers.},

Title = {The Bristol Pound: A Tool for Localisation?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {273-281},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Bristol Pound is not the first convertible local currency (CLC) to
   circulate regionally, to be administered by a credit union, or to be
   supported by a local council. However, it is the first to possess all
   three of these attributes simultaneously. For this reason, the Bristol
   Pound has been heralded by some as marking a new era for local
   currency-driven localisation. To explore the Bristol Pound's impact on
   localisation, 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   businesses and other Bristol Pound stakeholders. Economists were also
   interviewed to gain insights into the barriers to localisation and the
   likely impact of a CLC on these barriers. Overall, our findings suggest
   that the Bristol Pound is not driving localisation. Many of the key
   barriers were found to be political/institutional in nature (e.g.
   support for free trade, the free movement of capital, the power of
   global corporations, and the expansionary logic of capitalism). Such
   barriers are unlikely to be influenced by a CLC. We therefore suggest
   that those pursuing localisation should engage in a more active agenda
   that aims to change government policy and institutions to support an
   equitable, sustainable economy.},

Title = {Monetary de-measurement of taxation using cogni-economic pressure
   coefficient on a continuous progressivity model: Towards equitable
   taxation for Kenya},
Journal = {COGENT ECONOMICS \& FINANCE},

Abstract = {Tax derives from subjects' earnings measured in monetary terms, a
   principle anchored in financial accounting. The canon of equity,
   especially the vertical form, sometimes referred to as ``ability to
   pay{''} remains monetary. However, negating conventional horizontal
   equity, equal taxable incomes often require employment of different
   economic rationality levels to earn them depending on the profession or
   sector the tax payer comes from; hence different cognitive energies are
   required to generate the same taxable income-disapproving the mere
   ``ability to pay{''} paradigm. From the Gamma Rationality Measure for
   the credit unions sector that comprises 67\% of Kenyan economic
   livelihoods and using a combination of econometric and Riemann double
   integral methods, the income consumption rationality function is
   derived, from which a Cogni-economic Pressure Coefficient is generated
   for each income level. The coefficient is used to work out a more
   equitable tax structure from a continuous progressivity tax model, for
   greater equity, incidentally securing a boost to productivity and
   economy canons of tax administration-a global lesson, specific for
   Kenya.},

Abstract = {Because most cooperative societies are despotic, it has been difficult
   to test models of egalitarianism. Female African lions demonstrate a
   unique form of plural breeding in which companions consistently produce
   similar numbers of surviving offspring. Consistent with theoretical
   predictions from models of reproductive skew, female lions are unable to
   control each other's reproduction because of high costs of fighting and
   low access to each other's newborn cubs. A female also tacks incentives
   to reduce her companions' reproduction, because her own survival and
   reproduction depend on group territoriality and synchronous breeding.
   Consequently, female relationships are highly symmetrical, and female
   lions are ``free agents{''} who only contribute to communal care when
   they have cubs of their own.},

   signaling works under the firms, given a certain distribution of

Abstract = {Building successful savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) that
   actually embody the cooperative principles is a challenge to development
   agencies. Although SACCOs form the majority of microfinance providers in
   many developing countries, the most recent literature on microfinance
   governance and performance has given little reference to the
   longstanding body of relevant cooperative literature. SACCO
   representation in microfinance datasets is biased. Drawing on so-far
   unexploited datasets of Ugandan SACCOs and savings groups, this paper
   empirically analyses policy debate regarding SACCO- and savings group
   regulation. The findings point to the relevance of practically
   implementing the principle of cooperation between cooperatives' to
   ensure effective governance at SACCO level. Moreover, the paper
   introduces two new measures, based on members' savings and shares, which
   could become useful tools to track the application of cooperative
   principles in developing countries, and hence improve evidence-based
   policy-making for SACCOs.},

Abstract = {Rural economic development helps reduce the income inequality in China.
   Existing studies show the positive effects of rural reforms, however,
   whether the rural credit cooperative's shareholding reform promotes
   rural economic development and whether effects are exerted through the
   synergism between agricultural producers and rural financial
   institutions remain unclear yet. Employing the rationale of isomorphic
   incentive compatibility from system science, we analyze the necessity
   and influencing conduit of rural credit cooperative's shareholding
   reform theoretically. Analysis shows that only the financial services
   from rural commercial banks can promote the modernized production, and
   thus the synergism between them drives rural economic development. Then
   we make empirical analysis on the effect with a Chinese provincial
   sample. Comparing to provinces with lower reform progress, the provinces
   with greater reform progress are influenced more prominently by this
   reform. Applying coupling coordination degree model, the coordination
   between agricultural production and rural banking development shows
   obvious increase, especially after the formal implementation of
   shareholding reform on rural credit cooperative. Empirical results
   indicate that this synergism plays positive roles in promoting
   agricultural growth and reducing the urban-rural income gap. In
   addition, these effects are more pronounced after the formal
   implementation of shareholding reform.},

Abstract = {This paper explored changes in the business efficiency of Rural Credit
   Cooperatives (RCCs) in eleven regions of Hebei province since the rural
   finance reform beginning in 2003. We measured the business efficiency by
   using DEA-BCC Model and Malmquist index. On the whole DEA efficiency
   showed improvement while each region's RCCs DEA efficiency existing
   obvious differences over the 2004 similar to 2015 period. Malmquist
   analysis showed financial service technique innovation became the major
   cause of DEA efficiency enhancement since year 2010. Tobit regression
   showed that internal factors like credit scale, risks controlling and
   financial innovation, which reflect scale efficiency and pure technical
   efficiency, and environmental variables like per capita disposable
   income and agricultural GDP proportion, had significant effects on DEA
   efficiency. This paper is the first to make comparative study on the
   business efficiency of RCCs in eleven regions of Hebei province.},

Title = {Exploring the Linkages Between Women's Paid and Unpaid Work and Their

Abstract = {Economic bargaining models contend that women's paid work reduces
   violence experienced due to increased bargaining power, while male
   backlash models argue that violence is likely to increase as the
   traditional male breadwinner role is threatened. The empirical linkages
   between women working for pay and experiencing men's violence are also
   mixed. This study examines the association between women's paid work
   participation and their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV)
   and non-partner violence (NPV). It uses multivariate probit regressions
   to analyze survey data from 937 randomly selected women members of
   cooperative societies spanning the seven districts of Nepal. The paper
   hypothesizes that in a traditional setting like Nepal, working women are
   more likely to experience increased violence as they transgress
   traditional gender roles. Results suggest that employed women experience
   both IPV and NPV. Investments in longitudinal studies are needed to
   understand the point at which economic empowerment yields reversals in
   violence experienced.},

Abstract = {Cooperatives are a small component of a democratic system that is closer
   to the community. They gradually introduce basic democratic values to
   members through collective action and the delegation of power. To
   understand the democratic culture in the Thai cooperatives, this paper
   focuses on the level of members' participation in the democratic
   administration of the thrift and credit cooperatives in Thailand. It
   also explores the effect of cooperatives' sizes on members'
   participation. The findings indicate that about one-half of the thrift
   and credit cooperatives in Thailand have less than 50\% of members
   attending in the general assembly and voting in director election. About
   40\% of societies having contested board elections. The study also found
   that with increasing size, attendance in general assembly and voting in
   board election of members tend to decline, whereas the competition for
   the seats of directors tend to be more.},

Abstract = {Women's participation in political processes is important to address
   gender inequality and strengthen democracy. In Indian context, to
   empower women and enable political participation, 73rd Constitutional
   Amendment Act (1992) was introduced. Subsequently, many women entered
   politics. Though widespread proxy is reported, still a small proportion
   engages effectively in governmental participation (Hust, 2002; Mathew,
   2003; Palanithurai, 2001). Studies also find female Dalit-headed
   panchayats are more active (Jayshree, 2010; Kalaiselvi, 2012). As the
   cultural norms, traditions and patriarchy are rigid, the paper attempts
   to examine what helps the women to be functional? Does social networks
   differ? Is there a link between social capital, by way of
   associationalism, and capacity for self governance as suggested by
   Putnam (1993) in the Indian context? Social capital is understood
   through social networks and membership in associations. Thirty-eight
   elected representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions of southern Tamil
   Nadu, south India was interviewed in depth. Active members prominently
   belong to Dalit community and the social network of the elected active
   members is larger in size, heterogeneous in terms of age, gender and
   caste composition, and they are anchors themselves. They are primarily
   embedded in a web of political, caste and self-help group associations
   and have access to all women police stations, cooperative societies and
   political parties through family ties. The elected representative's
   mandatory membership in district Dalit federations provides safety-net
   in dealing with discrimination and atrocities while also intervening at
   the village-level panchayat. Dalit women who have the capacity to
   mobilize social capital emerge efficient in local self governance.},

Title = {Has the uniformity of banking regulation within the European Union
   restricted rather than encouraged sectoral development?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {48-65},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The recent international financial crisis exposed many of the frailties
   that existwithin the European banking sector. One major decision taken
   by the European Commission was to transition the powers of the Committee
   of European Banking Supervisors to that of the European Banking
   Authority (EBA). Our analysis focuses primarily on the differing
   behaviour by each European country's banking sector to major shocks,
   namely that in the form of bank closures. It is then necessary to
   investigate and further understand the role that the European Banking
   Authority now possesses with regards to releasing sensitive
   announcements based on the underlying currents of the European Banking
   system as measured by domestic banking sector stock returns. Finally, we
   investigate the cultural characteristics that can be uncovered by
   analysing the responses of domestic banking sectors to uniform
   regulation. We present three key findings. First, European countries
   with more local banking networks in the form of credit unions, public
   banks or savings banks, generate greater levels of volatility when
   compared to that of their commercial counterparts, particularly in
   countries with more monopolistic sectors. Secondly, the announcements of
   the European Banking Authority generate significant volatility effects
   for the European banking sector at large, with particular emphasis on
   stress testing results, but also announcements based on
   recapitalisation, regulation and transparency. Finally, cultural
   distance effects are identified, indicating that peripheral states are
   experiencing more substantial volatility effects to European Banking
   Authority decisions. These results indicate that uniformity of
   regulation may in fact be hindering and restricting the growth of some
   domestic and more peripheral and locally designed banking sectors in the
   form of rules designed for commercial banking operations. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to evaluate financially several
   maguey pulquero products and by-products and develop a business
   portfolio. Data were collected from a maguey pulquero cooperative
   society through the use of a strategic planning and investment
   instrument. The commercial diagnostic phases, market research and
   products portfolio design were considered. To obtain information for the
   portfolio, a productive chain analysis was conducted, considering
   productive links, post-harvest management and commercialisation. Market
   research was done in two important market centres in influential
   regions, where knowledge and frequency of consumption of maguey pulquero
   products was identified. The Boston Consulting Group Matrix was used to
   integrate the portfolio's products and by-products, and the Ansoff
   Matrix was employed to determine the product's positioning. Finally, an
   investment and economic viability analysis of the products portfolio was
   carried out. Six products were identified, with pulque and agave syrup
   being the investment priority products owing to the profits they
   generate. Penca, ixtle and paper generate complementary income. The
   strategies for pulque and agave syrup are market penetration, and the
   strategies for the remaining products are market and product
   development. The analysis of products include positive-tonet present
   value, investment return rate and cost benefit ratio.},

Abstract = {The global financial system is an essential component of the global
   economy. Its role can be compared with the circulatory system that
   ensures the delivery of funds to economic entities. The total number of
   components of the global financial system is about 50,000 credit
   institutions, including microcredit financial institutions, the public
   sector, commercial banks, credit unions, cooperative banks, etc. The
   Russian financial system is presented by the Bank of Russia in Russia
   more than 876 credit organizations, including non-bank credit
   organizations. Most of them, about 91\%, are banking organizations,
   about 9\% are non-banking organizations. According to EY experts, most
   operations in the banking sector, such as payments and transfers,
   financing and capital management will be carried out using innovative
   approaches and technologies. This makes the development and management
   of the innovation process in Russian banks relevant. For the successful
   development and application of the innovation process in Russian banks,
   it is necessary to determine the development directions of the
   innovation process in the Russian banking sector. In order to determine
   the priority directions of development, it is advisable to divide
   financial organizations into groups depending on indicators reflecting
   the efficiency of their business activities. According to the results of
   the assessment, the existing set of global financial organizations was
   divided into 4 groups like the BCG matrix. On the basis of the analysis
   conducted, conclusions were made about the directions of innovative
   development for each of the groups.},

Abstract = {Since the construction of the new countryside, the implementation of the
   interest rate market has made the rural credit cooperatives which are
   still in the extensive management suffer from many strong competitors
   such as commercial banks and other financial institutions. For loan
   transaction, the anchor point for rural credit cooperatives to stay in
   the rural financial market, reasonable price decides directly the
   competition result between rural credit cooperatives and other financial
   institutions. This paper aims to explore some problems such as high
   interest rate, weak technical base which causes the lacking of pricing
   basis, the rigidity of inner management system and so on by analyzing of
   W rural credit cooperatives. Based on the causes of these problems, the
   thesis puts forward some ideas to improve the initial pricing strategy
   of W rural credit cooperatives, such as making reasonable price through
   using cost-plus pricing strategy, price leadership strategy and customer
   profit analysis strategy based on the principle of customer segmentation
   etc.},

Abstract = {Grassroots innovation (GRI) that meets the needs of people at the bottom
   of the pyramid is driven typically by economically disadvantaged people
   who find practical and creative solutions using indigenous knowledge to
   solve their localized problems. In this study, we propose a
   comprehensive framework to describe factors contributing to the
   feasibility and value of GRI in society. By employing a triangulation
   approach, we identify the drivers of GRI, develop and define GRI as a
   multidimensional construct, explain the outcomes, and suggest the
   moderating factors conducive to GRI success. We then discuss and develop
   research propositions on the various proposed relationships in the GRI
   framework. In addition to setting up a foundation for a future research
   stream based on GRI, this study provides implications for policymakers,
   mainstream firms, and co-operative societies/non-profit organizations to
   realize the financial, environmental, and societal benefits from GRI.},

Abstract = {Our research is a conceptual study in which we identify and discuss the
   Corporate Governance structure and the Risk Governance Framework of 364
   Italian credit cooperative banks in 2015. As sound corporate governance
   and internal controls have become the determinant elements for the
   stability of every single institution and of the overall financial
   system, we tried to draft a Corporate Governance and Risk Management
   model in order to evaluate its adequacy and compliance with the laws and
   the new regulatory requirements, imposed by the European Central Bank
   and the Basel Committee and transposed into the Italian legislative
   context by Banca d'Italia.
   This adequacy can also be reflected on the capitalisation of these
   banks. In fact, at the end of our paper, we briefly analyse the impact
   of an effective Corporate Governance system on the internal capital, as
   required by Basel II.
   Finally, we tried to consider the interaction between Corporate
   Governance and Risk Governance in order to strengthen the role of a
   robust communication among the different boards involved.},

Abstract = {Our research explores the Italian banking sector. In particular it
   focuses on the analysis of the cyber risk management in Bene Banca, a
   Credit Cooperative Bank (BCC) in the North-West of Italy.
   This research represents a case study that can help us understand the
   context and the main characteristics of the methodology implied by Bene
   Banca in managing cyber risk. Data were collected through
   semi-structured interviews of an open-ended nature and questionnaires to
   directors, members of the audit committee, risk managers, compliance
   managers, internal audit function and anti-money laundering responsible.
   We decided to concentrate on this small bank because of its size and its
   role on the local territory and because the cyber risk management is
   outsourced.
   Furthermore we focus on the topic of cyber crime because IT attacks have
   increased drastically in recent years, both in terms of complexity and
   resources, and they cannot be stopped by single organizations, because
   they need a response at country level.
   Consequently this paper has been motivated by the gaps in the
   understanding and in considering cyber risk and cyber risk management as
   an integral part of the business management.},

Abstract = {Effluent treatment plants need land for construction, capital cost,
   power and specialized manpower for their operation and maintenance.
   Because of these constraints, small scale tanneries can not afford to
   have their own effluent treatment facilities and therefore, combined
   effluent from all tanneries are to be brought to a centralized place for
   treatment. This facility is called a Common Effluent Treatment Plant
   (CETP). For operation and maintenance of CETP, small scale tanners
   formed a co-operative society. The expenses for operation and
   maintenance of CETP are being shared by participating tanneries.
   Wastewater management for the cluster of small scale tanneries was
   studied in details and various measures were incorporated to improve
   performance of the CETP and also to improve treated effluent quality to
   confirm standard prescribed by regulatory agencies. Performance of
   existing CETP was evaluated. Based on the results, bench scale
   laboratory treatability studies were conducted for improvement in
   treated effluent quality and also to suggest appropriate modifications
   to the CETP. These studies are detailed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Even though several differences exist between co-operatives and
   capitalist enterprises, such as the democratic governance style of the
   co-operatives, both types of enterprises compete with each other. In
   this context, how can the co-operatives distinguish themselves from
   private enterprises? Based on the AMO bundles model (for Abilities,
   Motivation and Opportunity to participate) and on the three-component
   model of organizational commitment, this study collected data from 578
   respondents of financial service co-operatives in eastern Canada. This
   research had two primary objectives. First, it seeks to examine if
   employees perceive a co-operative difference through HRM practices which
   influences their commitment. Second, it aims to evaluate the relations
   between HRM practices, employees' perception of a co-operative
   difference, and their organizational commitment through the influence of
   some socio-demographic variables. The main findings are that: (1) the
   employees perceived a co-operative difference through HRM practices that
   influenced their commitment; (2) the more the employees had work
   experience, the more they perceived a co-operative difference, and the
   more they displayed affective and normative commitment; (3) the higher
   the hierarchical status of the employees, the less they displayed
   calculative commitment; (4) the employees with union membership
   displayed lower affective and normative commitment.},

Abstract = {In order to accelerate the development of rural credit cooperatives and
   consummate the system to help the rural economy go ahead steadily and
   improve farmers' income level, more and more researchers have analyzed
   the risk management of rural credit cooperatives. From the view of
   institutional character and service object of rural credit cooperatives,
   the primary business is to provide loans to the farmers who have
   difficulties on living and production. But there is a lot of risk in the
   process. In this paper, based on the previous, the analysis and
   management to operational risk during credit business in rural credit
   cooperatives are the main parts. The main problem this paper proposed is
   that how to control the operational risks in the credit business in
   rural credit cooperatives. And in the end, this paper puts forward some
   suggestions which are consummating the credit system and improving the
   staff management of rural credit cooperatives.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the decisions made by one secondary school in a
   major English city to become a co-operative academy. This school is
   located in an area affected by economic hardship and social and cultural
   tensions. The school, prior to its conversion to an academy, was well
   known in the local area for its commitment to social justice principles.
   Drawing on interview data collected from senior administrators,
   teachers, governors and students in the school, this paper seeks to
   understand why a school with a commitment to social justice would go
   down the academy route given the social justice concerns raised by such
   a move. This paper also considers if becoming a co-operative academy
   presents an ironic opportunity to resist many of the current regressive
   educational trends epitomised by academisation. This paper suggests that
   within the current English context, as in many other locations, a
   socially just approach to schooling requires alternatives to be explored
   and that the case study school's engagement with the Co-operative
   Society might present one such exploration.},

Abstract = {The modern banking system is important for the global economy. Its role
   is comparable to the human circulatory system, through which money is
   delivered to economic actors. Despite the importance of the global
   banking system for the global economy, there is no reliable statistics
   on the number of banks and credit organizations all over the world.
   Sample estimates suggest 50,000 credit institutions, including
   microcredit financial institutions, the public sector, commercial banks,
   credit unions, cooperative banks, etc. According to the Bank of Russia,
   the Russian financial system is represented in Russia with more than 876
   credit institutions. organizations, including non-bank credit
   organizations. Of these, 91\% are banks, and 9\% are non-bank credit
   organizations. 11 banks are classified in accordance with the
   methodology of the Bank of Russia and are systemically important. Their
   share is 1.26\% of the total number of organizations. About a third
   (36\%) of credit institutions have the right to conduct banking
   operations. According to the Bank of Russia, 82.64\% of credit
   institutions are organizations attracting deposits, 98.14\% carry out
   operations in foreign currency, and 44.21\% carry out operations with
   precious metals. The data reflecting the size of the capital of the
   leaders of the global financial market show that not a single Russian
   bank is in the TOP 100 Russian banks.},

Abstract = {This paper explores tensions over scale and viability in irrigated
   agricultural development in Tanzania. A revival of ambition to transform
   African agriculture has reawakened debate over what type of agriculture
   can best deliver increased production and poverty reduction for rural
   populations. This paper examines these debates through the lens of an
   ethnographic study of an irrigated rice farm in Tanzania. With a
   chequered history of state and donor intervention management, Dakawa,
   Rice Farm in Mvomero District is now collectively farmed by a
   cooperative society of `small farmers'. It is widely hailed as a
   success, both of irrigation production, and of `small farmers' in
   delivering this. However, such narratives of smallness and success
   obscure a more complex reality in which smallness of scale may be more
   of a discursive tool than a reflection of empirical reality. Although
   notions of `viability' and `success' in such development interventions
   are themselves also contested and depend on perspective, there is
   evidence that there are fundamental problems of both short- and
   long-term viability.},

Abstract = {Although the rural credit cooperatives are the only formal credit
   providers to millions of households in rural China, empirical evidence
   suggests that they do not serve the interests of member households very
   effectively. This study examines how far the recent institutional
   reforms have addressed the problems, of insider control and collective
   action in corporate governance and reduced local political influence on
   their operations.
   It contributes to the currently scant literature on the reasons for the
   persistence in China of local political interference in loan
   allocations. This study's findings suggest the need for a re-evaluation
   of the conventional wisdom that the role of local states in China's
   development is a positive one.},

Abstract = {The article outlines the issues of financial support provided to
   agricultural producers through a lending system. The results of the
   activities of credit partnerships were analyzed using the example of
   Credit Partnership (CP) Tselinogradskoye Limited Liability Partnership
   (LLP) in Akmola region and the agricultural enterprise Aktyk Agrofirm
   JSC. CP Tselinogradskoye LLP provides soft loans and subsidies at
   interest rates that are much lower than market rates. The performance of
   the credit partnership, which is ensured by annual monitoring by the CP
   of the targeted use of bank loans and borrowings, the financial
   condition of the business entity, as well as their collateral. The
   relationship of the results of production and financial activities of
   agricultural business entity and credit unions, reasonable given the
   specific data of participants who received loans due to improved their
   operational and financial performance. It is noted that the
   effectiveness of the use of financial resources, regardless of their
   structuring and affiliation, is expressed through indicators of
   productive production activities of the enterprise. It is substantiated
   that, based on the principles of a systematic approach, the optimization
   of the structure of the formation of financial resources should be
   considered from the point of view of interdependence and interaction
   with production efficiency.},

Title = {The Key Factors Affecting Tree Producer Associations Involved in Private
   Commercial Forestry in Kenya},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Formal tree producer associations are critical for the sustainable
   management of private commercial farm forests in Kenya. However, there
   is limited information on their current status and the key factors
   driving their operations in the country. This paper sought to address
   this informational gap by reviewing the existing literature in the
   country from the theoretical background of sustainable development and
   later validating the obtained findings with the current state of
   knowledge at regional and global levels. Results from document content
   analysis indicate that there are over 10,000 tree growing farmers
   organized into planting groups across the country after many years of
   piloting by the government and private sector players. At the national
   level, there are two associations. These include Kenya Forest Growers
   Association (KEFGA), mainly composed of large scale planters, and Farm
   Forestry Smallholder Producers Association of Kenya (FFSPAK), targeting
   small-holders. Besides these two, six major sub-national associations
   are seeking to improve members' welfare by enhancing the acquisition of
   livelihood assets. Further, various socio-cultural, economic, and
   political factors affect their operations in Kenya. These associations
   have deployed multiple strategies to benefit their members. However, the
   formation of savings and credit cooperative societies (SACCOs) seems to
   be their preferred mode of community empowerment. In conclusion, even
   though these associations are still at the infancy stage, their future
   remains promising in-view of the observed behavioral change in their
   governance, which appears to favor entrenched equality and equity
   towards sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The Jewish Credit Cooperatives were an important manifestation (and
   tool) of Jewish self-assertion in the German economy rapidly dividing
   itself along racist fault lines even before the Nazis officially came to
   power in 1933. Based on files recently discovered in the course of his
   research on Jewish-owned businesses in Berlin, the author shows that the
   cooperatives came as part and parcel of a very efficient self-help
   system the Jewish community organized in 1933, which mainly granted
   microloans, thereby supporting businesses that would otherwise not have
   been able to borrow funds. The credit cooperatives filled an important
   gap and provided short-term credits for the rising number of Jewish
   self-employed in a more and more hostile surrounding in a country
   basically stripped of reserves. While the one cooperative went down in a
   crash in 1937, the other cooperative did business right until the pogrom
   if November 1938-which marked the beginning of the end of all commercial
   activity in Germany for Jews.},

Abstract = {Fishermen from Cave Caulker, Belize use a local management system based
   on traditional ``areas,{''} or territories, which limits access to the
   fishing areas around the caye. Data from Northern Fishermen Cooperative
   Society annual reports suggest that fishermen members of the cooperative
   have produced lobster tails at a stable rate for over thirty years.
   Other data from observations and interviews suggest that this seemingly
   effective local management system may be beginning to teeter. Many
   factors are shifting the nature of tenure and access to fishing areas in
   the lobster fishery around Caye Caulker. Other factors are increasing
   pressure on the lobster population. Here I will discuss changing tenure
   patterns, fishermen's children's emigration from the caye, and tourism
   development at the caye. Though these factors are defining
   characteristics of success among villagers at Caye Caulker, they are in
   other ways threatening the resilience of this folk management system.},

Abstract = {We formulate an oligopoly model in which social enterprise for the
   underprivileged competes with private enterprises under government
   subsidization, and examine the market role of private leadership. We
   show that Stackelberg private leadership is better from the viewpoint of
   total social welfare, while Cournot followership is better when the
   social provisions for the underprivileged are emphasized. We also find
   that both cost inefficiency and the number of private enterprises affect
   the profitability and welfare consequences. We then investigate the
   rationing policy on the production of social enterprise and show that
   output rationing is superior to market share rationing not only for the
   social concerns of the underprivileged but also for total social
   welfare, even though it is less attractive than subsidy policy. Finally,
   we find that there is a strategic over-incentive to pursue social
   activities under government subsidization.},

Abstract = {A number of academic studies have been done on the governing mechanisms
   of firms. They address the significance of the board of directors. The
   extant literature has focused on structural factors and performance of
   the board. Outside directors, board members' education and female
   representation have been considered essential board characteristics.
   Consequently the election of board members has become an object of
   interest. A successful election process is assumed to generate a
   competent board. Many of the studies discuss the topic in the context of
   public limited companies. However, cooperative seldom emerge in these
   studies. This has both academic and practical consequences: the
   understanding on the cooperative governance does not accumulate and
   practitioners do not have in-depth knowledge available in order to
   develop their cooperatives. What make cooperatives different from other
   firms are a broad member base, customer, worker, and entrepreneur
   relationships to the cooperative and differences in the governing
   bodies. These features have special implications on the governances of
   cooperatives. The purpose of this paper is to gather existing academic
   knowledge on cooperative governance and to produce an overall review on
   the governance mechanisms in cooperatives with an emphasis on the
   election of board members. The goal is to figure out what we know about
   the governance and the election of board members in cooperatives. The
   review sheds new light on the academic discussion on cooperative boards,
   their composition and processes as well as their election. The novelty
   of the work lies in the diverse approach of cooperative governance. The
   study shows knowledge gaps in the extant literature of cooperatives and
   makes suggestions on future research. It builds a framework for future
   studies in the field of the governance of producer, consumer and worker
   cooperatives as well as credit unions. The method of the study is the
   integrative literature review.},

Abstract = {This article states that it is necessary that a kind of incentive and
   compatible institution arrangement and strategically cooperative
   relation is to be set up between the rural credit cooperatives and the
   local governments, which the former serves as local financial
   institutions. On the one hand, to seek survival and development in the
   fierce market competition, the rural credit cooperatives must orientate
   market in the ``three rural{''}-farmer, agriculture and rural area, and
   actively seek for the support of local government, actively and steadily
   push forward reform, strengthen coordination and cooperation with local
   governmental departments related, thus enhancing their service capacity;
   On the other hand, the local governments need raise awareness and change
   their functions, via the way of creating a good economic and credit
   environment and providing preferential policies to support and promote
   the development of the rural credit cooperatives, so as to achieve
   mutual benefits and win-win situation.},

Abstract = {Co-operatives comprise the crucial third engine of growth for the
   Malaysian economy after the public and private sectors. This study
   investigates the human capital based governance structure, success
   factors and barriers to effective governance of co-operatives in
   Malaysia. Questionnaires were distributed to the top 100 co-operatives
   listed in the Malaysian Co-operative Societies Commission website.
   Analysis of the responses to the questionnaires showed that human
   capital based co-operatives governance comprise members' participation,
   independence of the board, depth of expertise and competencies of
   directors and other characteristics of the board. This study also
   identified branding as the most important success factor ahead of
   competitiveness and proximity. Malaysia's economy is projected to
   continue relying significantly on the performance of co-operatives.
   Thus, it is incumbent for greater attention to be given towards an
   effective governance that results in successful co-operatives. (C) 2016.

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse the nature of the relationship between market
   power and technical efficiency for producers' cooperatives. More
   specifically we test two hypotheses: first, we evaluate the extent to
   which increasing market pressure may help producers' cooperatives to
   improve technical efficiency to guarantee positive profits; second, we
   test whether higher technical efficiency induces producers' cooperatives
   to have a larger market share. These hypotheses are tested on a sample
   of Italian conventional and cooperative firms for the Wine Production
   and Processing sector, using both frontier analysis and dynamic panel
   techniques. The results support the hypothesis that increasing market
   pressure can affect positively the cooperatives efficiency, while gains
   in technical efficiency do not seem to have any impact on the
   cooperatives' market share.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether the relationship between competition and risk
   varies across different types of Japanese banks over the period
   20002009. The results of our empirical investigation show that risk
   varies across bank types. Specifically, nationwide (City and Trust)
   banks are riskier on average than their counterparts (Regional, Tier 2
   Regional, Shinkin and Credit Cooperative banks) with a regional focus.
   The relationship between competition and risk also varies across bank
   types based on different initial levels of risk. Increasing competition
   appears to reduce the risk of (City) banks with higher initial levels of
   risk, but increase the risk of their (Regional, Tier 2 Regional, Shinkin
   and Credit Cooperative) counterparts with lower initial levels of risk.},

Title = {Disabling governance: Privatisation of city markets and implications for

Journal = {HABITAT INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {Contemporary international models of governance prescribe the devolution
   of service provision to a range of non-state actors and the adoption of
   market-oriented policies. This paper explores the politics that have
   arisen from changes in the governance framework in Kampala, the capital
   of Uganda. The focus is on the privatisation of the management of city
   markets and on the relations between the multiple actors
   involved-private contractors, vendors' associations, cooperatives and
   state actors. in particular, the paper looks into the implications of
   the privatisation process for vendors and their associations. It argues
   that, while the latter have sometimes adjusted to the changes by turning
   into cooperative societies or creating their own management firms,
   increasingly, however, private interests external to the markets are
   taking over the management functions, sidelining or even repressing,
   vendors' associations. The general picture is one of weakening
   associations and endangered possibilities for broad-based organising and
   interest representation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ideology in Vicarious Learning-Related Communication},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {708-730},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Organizations often learn vicariously by observing what other
   organizations do. Our study examines vicarious learning-related
   communication through which individuals share their observations with
   other organizational members. Most students and members of present-day
   organizations would expect that this communication is driven by a
   prodevelopment logic-that communication serves the purpose of
   organizational improvement and competitiveness. Our unique historical
   evidence on learning-related communication over multiple decades shows
   that the subjective and collective attitude toward prodevelopment
   communication may be ideologically conditioned. Prodevelopment
   communication is the norm in capitalist organizations, but competing
   ideologies may emphasize other goals higher than organizational
   development. Consequently, increasing challenges to capitalism as the
   ideological basis of economic organization can have deep impacts on how
   organizations learn and produce innovations in the future. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {As an important part of the financial system in the country, the
   cooperative finance for a long time is greatly promoted by the
   government to solve the problem of weak financial support in the
   countryside. For various reasons, it has not achieved many results,
   which reflects that only with government promotion it could not achieve
   success. Since 2003, sonic mutually-supported financial societies
   gradually gain the recognition from the government supervision agencies
   and gain a lawful status. However such cooperative agencies proceed very
   slowly with a lot of hindrance factors. Comparatively, some cooperative
   societies simultaneously organized by the peasants and some peasants'
   financial mutual supporting agencies become active and become an
   important way to solve temporary financial needs of the farmers in the
   process of production, which also provide a possible way for the
   integration of various sources in the countryside. Such modes have
   achieved success in Japan and Korea, although in China they remain in
   the state of research. We need to establish a suitable way of financial
   cooperative system for the countryside in China on the bases of
   experiences of other countries.},

Title = {The empirical model of trust, loyalty, and business performance of the
   dairy milk supply chain A comparative study},
Journal = {BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {119},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2765-2787},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the
   relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence,
   price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data used in this study were primary data
   which were collected through personal interviews and closed
   questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The
   sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy
   cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and
   Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The
   study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software
   program to analyze the hypothesis.
   Findings - The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative
   communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect
   on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power
   dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java
   Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty
   for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier
   loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province,
   whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not
   significant effect on business performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is
   related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a
   business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship
   between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of
   cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future
   research may replicate this study in another region or in the other
   contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a
   producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of
   business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of
   financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the
   scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative.
   Practical implications - It is recommended that managers of dairy
   cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions
   especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As
   organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining
   the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation
   is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of
   milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and
   accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy
   cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value
   of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will
   maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is
   better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a
   marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative
   which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product.
   Social implications - The research confirms that individual dairy
   farmer's loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may
   encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the
   individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of
   their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives
   would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from
   the loyal dairy farmer.
   Originality/value - Although this research used the conceptual model
   from the previous study, this research will make some improvement.
   First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the
   construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader
   since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely,
   Central Java Province and West Java Province.},

Abstract = {Our research explores the Italian banking sector. It's focus on the
   world of Credit Cooperative Banks (BCCs). The reality of the mutual
   banks in Italy is very important: they are 364 BCCs in 2015 for a total
   of over 4,400 branches throughout the Italian territory. The employees
   are over 37,000.
   This study can help us understand the context and the main business in
   which banks operate. Data were extracted from Bankscope, which is a
   database containing comprehensive information on financial companies
   (banks and insurance companies) in Italy. Our sample represents 264
   Italian BCCs.
   In our research we want to show that the BCCs are relevant in the
   Italian banking sector and then the sample data are particularly
   significant also as an indicator of the Italian banking sector, then we
   have appropriately calculated the two indicators: the Profit Margin and
   ROE, and we put them in comparison to see how they have changed over the
   years.
   At the end we calculate the Pearson correlation ratio between
   Profit/Loss and Net Banking Income of each year. Thanks to this
   relationship, we are able to analyze the possible correlation of Net
   Banking Income on the profitability of the banks, in order to assess the
   effects of a policy that is carried out by governance to face the
   difficulties that the banking world is going through.},

Abstract = {Financial literacy deficiency is a prevailing problem in United States
   raising the need for effective financial education.
   Financial-institution leaders can play a crucial role in promoting
   financial literacy with their practical experience and expertise. This
   article sheds new light on the application of online technology to
   promote financial literacy by exploring the perceptions of
   financial-institution leaders. Supported by Dewey's pragmatic
   constructivist paradigm and the PEST conceptual framework, a qualitative
   inquiry research through in-depth telephone interviews with 20 leaders
   from banks and credit unions in Texas was conducted. The findings
   revealed some common ways to provide online financial literacy
   education, including website information posting, online financial
   calculators, external links, social media communication, and partnering
   with appropriate third parties. The financial leaders perceived that
   applying online technology would be an enlightening future direction
   especially for the millennial generation but face-to-face education
   would remain important. The opportunities included social responsibility
   fulfillment, corporate image strengthening, marketing, and favorable
   regulatory consideration. The challenges involved the human and
   financial resources constraints, IT support, lack of effective
   evaluation, and how to motivate online learning. Some leaders suggested
   the use of games, financial incentives, and innovative apps. The policy
   implications included increase in government support, partnership with
   schools, embracing financial literacy in the state test, and
   collaboration among financial leaders, regulators, educators, and policy
   makers to foster financial literacy for the benefits of the society.},

Abstract = {The incentives and governance system of organizations are important in
   explaining how they behave in localized development processes. This
   article builds on the observation that the literature on territorial
   development does not generally address the action of social movements.
   At the same time, research on social movements rarely studies their
   effects on the territories ill which they act. This text is a
   contribution to fill this gap. It compares two social movement
   organizations: a trade union federation and a credit cooperative system
   operating throughout southern Brazil, Both organizations share common
   origins and social bases, yet their impacts oil territories have been
   quite different. The analysis focuses Oil the social ties that link
   trade unions and cooperatives to their territories to show that
   governance systems may explain the performance of each organization,
   especially with regard to their capacity for innovation. (c) 2008

Abstract = {This study is part of a new agenda for research and discussion on
   solidarity credit cooperativism in Minas Gerais that seeks to unveil the
   structuring, organization and impact of the insertion of a new
   cooperative system in the state. The object of study is a solidary
   credit cooperative, Cresol Sudeste de Minas, formerly Creditag
   Fervedouro, which offers financial products and services with priority
   for family farming, located in Fervedouro/ MG. The objective is to
   describe the trajectory and the structuring process of the Cresol
   Sudeste de Minas cooperative with the scope of the 2007/2017 time frame,
   identifying the organizational changes spread since the transition from
   Creditag Fervedouro to the Cresol system. The method used was either
   qualitative and descriptive, and the case study was applied as a
   research strategy with the use of semi-structured interviews with key
   actors. The search for legitimacy, the desire to operationalize the
   PRONAF and the demands imposed by the external environment were key
   factors that culminated the transition to the Cresol system, and the
   advantages of organizational changes presented by the cooperative
   members themselves and the cooperative leaders go beyond that they
   wanted.},

Journal = {BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW},

Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-72},

Abstract = {Cooperatives are facing the challenge to be competitive in the market,
   without losing their traditional values of mutuality and democracy. To
   do that, they need to re-construct open and participative dialogue with
   their employees and members based on more democratic forms of
   communication and engagement. From this point of view, the measurement
   and communication of sustainability aspects may allow a dialogue to be
   mobilized with shareholders and stakeholders without losing the
   attention on competitive factors. Based on these premises, the article
   analyses the experience of a 5-year action research project (from 2006
   to mid-2011), carried out within Unicoop Tirreno, an Italian consumers'
   cooperative, and aimed to implement different tools for sustainability
   accounting and to embrace a more open dialogue with stakeholders, in
   particular with employees and members. In this process of change, the
   tools implemented for sustainability accounting played a key role in
   supporting the cooperative to reinterpret its own values and in
   stimulating a new and participative management approach. The results
   indicate a virtuous circle between the management and measurement of
   cooperative principles and the management and measurement of
   sustainability issues.},

Abstract = {Paper analyzes systemic studies of the traditional economic activity and
   way of life of the indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North.
   Research into the Reindeer Herding Industry has been conducted in order
   to gain information on their management and to develop a
   socially-oriented strategy conducive to overcoming the accumulated
   problems. Institutional transformation is a mechanism through which the
   accumulated problems of herding can be addressed, and the industry can
   be shifted from a pattern of regression towards evolutionary
   development. Institutional transformation is based in the ethnic and
   economic features of the reindeer herding family and ancestral
   households and directed towards correcting the defects of the legal
   system and the system of herding management. The conflict between the
   needs of family and ancestral farms, the resources of the traditional
   economy, and the established institutions pose challenges - ideological
   (political), social, economic, and ecological - to the system of
   management. The organizational model for institutional transformation in
   the reindeer herding industry is founded on the confirmation of the
   private farm as the primary legal form of organization for reindeer
   herding, supplemented by competence centers, reindeer herding parks, the
   legal, organizational entity of the agricultural consumer cooperative,
   and novel measures of state support for family and traditional
   households. These findings indicate a connection between the problems of
   reindeer herding, indigenous peoples, and national settlements.
   Accordingly, projects aimed at solving the problems in the spheres of
   the traditional way of life must function jointly on the social,
   ecological, and economic levels. (C) 2021 Published by

Abstract = {We implement a large-scale field experiment with 200 Savings and Credit
   Cooperative Associations (SACCOs) in Rwanda, and test competing models
   of local financial education delivery. One-third of SACCOs were invited
   to a comprehensive training-of-trainers (TOT) workshop and stipulated to
   send the SACCO manager, a loan officer, and a community board member to
   be trained. Another one-third were allowed free selection of trainers,
   which resulted in greater community representation and lower loan
   officer involvement a the TOT and higher attendance rates at the
   beneficiary trainings. We find no improvements in financial practices or
   behavior among the fixed selection group, but statistically significant
   and larger improvements in financial planning, rules of thumb, and
   savings deposits among the autonomous selection group. Qualitative
   fieldwork to understand mechanisms underscores the importance of
   community-led delivery of the financial education program.},

Title = {Managing risk in credit cooperative banks: Lessons from a case study},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore how the implementation of enterprise
   risk management (ERM) practices can help organisations to pursue both
   economic and social goals. To do so, we look at the credit cooperative
   banking sector, which often attempts to conduct socially responsible
   business practices. To deepen our understanding of how such banks deal
   with risk, we provide an in-depth study of one credit cooperative bank.
   The analysis highlights the peculiarities of ERM practices implemented
   in a specific context and explains how an ERM system enables credit
   cooperative banks to manage the risks associated with a duality of
   purpose.
   This research is relevant from a theoretical perspective because it
   addresses new trends in the risk management literature, thus elucidating
   how ERM systems can be implemented to support dual-purpose
   organisations. The study also adds to the literature on ethical banking,
   as it offers an in-depth description of how ERM systems work in this
   particular context. This paper also has practical implications; it
   provides insights to similar banks on how to manage risk in a way that
   supports social development in their local communities. Our analysis is
   also of interest to other types of socially-oriented businesses, which
   may follow a similar approach to operationalise ERM practices. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Dairying has played a significant role in providing a livelihood to
   farmers in India. About 80 million rural Indian households are engaged
   in milk production with a very high proportion being landless, small and
   marginal farmers. The study aims to analyse the challenges faced by the
   dairy industry in generating employment and expanding their business.
   The paper has taken data from annual survey of industries over 20 years
   and a case study with a detailed interview of a cooperative society
   working in the dairy sector. The analysis is based on autoregressive
   distributed lag model. With the help of analysis, the study found that
   the dairy industry has the potential to generate employment. During the
   interaction for the case study, it was observed that firms in the dairy
   industry undertake the production of value-added products to yield
   profits which is limited due to low investments. However, the lack of
   advertisements of these products results in restrained sales and limits
   income of the farmers. Therefore, the study suggests that the private
   sector should be encouraged through product link incentive scheme and
   the government should intervene as a facilitator for their growth and
   expansion on international levels.},

Abstract = {Wood carving industry has passed through many stages of development,
   from a purely primitive structure to a near-modern business. The
   industry has been in existence for over one hundred years but have
   suffered a stunted development due to neglect by policy makers. Wood
   carving is an important and long established traditional artifact
   industry in Ibadan metropolis and Oyo township. The industry has a very
   rich cultural background that has influenced in no small way, its
   organization, products and survival. Socio-economic assessment of wood
   artifact products in Oyo state, Nigeria was carried out with a view to
   determining the value of the enterprise. Structured questionnaires were
   administered on the wood carvers. Purposive sampling method was adopted
   in selecting the respondents. Forty questionnaires were given to wood
   carvers of which thirty two (80 per cent) were duly filled and returned.
   The study showed that a large number of people are engaged in the
   industry which has a high potential for employment and fuller
   utilization of timber resources. The product quality is greatly affected
   by the carvers' skills as well as the tree species used. Results showed
   that the industry is profitable with an average Gross Margin of
   N333,274.50 and an average Net Return of N328,304.50 annually per
   enterprise. The wood carving industry is beset with some problems,
   prominent among these are lack of finance for expansion, narrow market,
   cultural belief and poor business organization. It is recommended that
   the carvers must of necessity team up as a cooperative society for a
   proper development of the industry which in turn would foster government
   assistance to provide incentives for wood carving industry in Nigeria.},

Title = {Do migrant remittances matter for financial development in Kenya?},
Journal = {FINANCIAL INNOVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {The paper analyzes the relationship between remittances and financial
   development using Kenyan quarterly data from 2006 to 2016. Five
   different indicators of financial development are used: credit to the
   private sector as a share of GDP, the number of mobile transactions, the
   value of these mobile transactions, the number of mobile agents, and the
   number of bank accounts. The results from using an autoregressive
   distributed lag demonstrate a strong, positive relationship between
   remittances and financial development in long-run equations. This
   suggests that higher levels of remittances provide opportunities for
   recipients to open bank accounts, enhance their savings, and access
   financial systems, in addition to exposing the previously unbanked to
   both new and existing financial products. The results also confirm the
   potential advantage of embracing modern and advanced technology to
   facilitate international mobile transfers. Using international
   remittance transfers through mobile technology reduces costs by
   eliminating the need for physical branches and personnel to attend to
   walk-in customers. Aside from offering convenience and safety for
   remittance actors, this method also dominates traditional remittance
   business models. Therefore, a policy window exists for the government to
   leverage on remittances as a tool of financial inclusion and depth, and
   particularly through the continued expansion of regulatory space to
   accommodate the wider use of international mobile remittance transfer
   channels. Moreover, given the strong, positive relationship between
   remittances and credit to the private sector as indicated by its share
   of GDP and number of bank accounts, commercial banks and other players
   in the remittance market may also find it useful to develop customized
   products for migrants to access their remittances. For example,
   financial intermediaries can consider providing better deposit interest
   rates for diaspora deposits compared to deposits made in the local
   currency. Further, these institutions can allow regular remittance flows
   to act as collateral for the allocation of credit, among other
   incentives to tap into the significant potential of money remitted by
   migrants to Kenya. The study also recommends that the government
   consider expanding exploitation of diaspora bonds and diaspora savings
   and credit cooperative societies while drawing lessons from other
   countries' previous attempts.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite 2016 legalization of recreational cannabis cultivation
   and sale in California with the passage of Proposition 64, many cannabis
   businesses operate without licenses. Furthermore, federal regulations
   disincentivize financial institutions from banking and lending to
   licensed cannabis businesses. The authors explore the impact of legal
   cannabis business activity on California financial institutions, the
   barriers to banking faced by cannabis businesses, and the nontraditional
   sources of financing used by the industry. Design/methodology/approach
   The authors use a mixed methods approach. The authors utilize call data
   for banks and credit unions headquartered in California and state
   cannabis licensing data to estimate the impact of the extensive and
   intensive margins of licensed cannabis activity on key banking
   indicators using difference-and-difference and fixed effects
   regressions. The qualitative data come from interviews with industry
   stakeholders in northern California's ``Emerald Triangle{''} and add
   important context. Findings The quantitative results show economically
   and statistically significant impacts of licensed cannabis activity on
   banking indicators, suggesting both direct and spillover effects from
   cannabis activity to the financial sector. However, cannabis businesses
   report substantial barriers to accessing basic financial services and
   credit, leading to nontraditional financing arrangements. Practical
   implications The results suggest opportunities for cannabis businesses
   and financial institutions if regulations are eased and important
   avenues for further study. Originality/value The authors contribute to
   the nascent literature on cannabis economics and the literature on
   banking regulation and nontraditional finance.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the cooperative movement emergency in Portugal on
   the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, focusing the
   pre-modern legacy revealed in their promoters' social origin, as well as
   in the moral values and purposed objectives. It is based on a
   comprehensive review of cooperative societies' foundation acts and
   statutes and in the comparison between these latter with the pre-modem
   institutions for collective action written norms the craft guilds
   regimentos (regulations) and the rural communities posturas (municipal
   ordinances).
   The available data allows one to sustain that the earliest cooperatives,
   following mutual-aid societies, were mainly created by the craft
   community, which was making use of cooperation to assure the continuity
   of ancient practices. The functions fulfilled by the craft guilds, the
   brotherhoods, the commons and other pre-modem institutions were
   overtooked by their modern counterparts in a process of institutional
   adjustment to the new political and legal framework. In this way, is
   argued that, despite the different nature of nineteen. century voluntary
   associations movement, the resilience of self-governance, mutuality and
   social control has to be related to the previous centuries of corporate
   collective action.},

Title = {An empirical analysis of the characteristics of savings and credit
   cooperatives participating in the reporting excellence awards in Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING IN EMERGING ECONOMIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {223-243},
Abstract = {Purpose - In Kenya, an award for reporting excellence is presented
   annually to the entities in the public and private sector. The purpose
   of this paper is to examine the characteristics of savings and credit
   cooperatives (SACCOs) that apply for the annual reporting excellence
   award in Kenya.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study employs correlation and probit
   regression analyses to establish the factors which explain the decision
   by SACCOs to participate in the Financial Reporting (FIRE) excellence
   award. The study utilizes data consisting of 1,272 firm-year
   observations for 212 SACCOs, over the period 2008-2013.
   Findings - Consistent with institutional and legitimacy theories, the
   results demonstrate that structural and governance variables are
   significant and positively associated with the decision to participate
   in the annual FIRE awards by SACCOs in Kenya. Similarly, larger SACCOs
   and those that have adopted best cooperative governance practices are
   more likely to participate in the annual FIRE awards. The results also
   reveal that SACCOs audited by the Big 4 audit firms are more likely to
   participate in the annual FIRE awards.
   Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on the factors
   explaining the decision to participate in the annual reporting
   excellence awards by organizations in a specific sector. Further studies
   can adopt a multi-sectoral approach to investigate the same phenomenon.
   Practical implications - The findings highlight the importance of
   cooperative governance and resources in explaining why SACCOs choose to
   participate in the FIRE awards.
   Originality/value - The study adds onto the dearth of literature on the
   aspect under focus. Globally, very few studies have examined the drivers
   of the decision to participate in reporting excellence awards by
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Technical dairy innovations (TDI), such as improved cow feeding, health
   management and genetic improvement, could boost milk production. At the
   same time, organisational and institutional dairy innovations (OIDI),
   including group milk sales, feed and credit access, could boost dairy
   supply chain efficiency. This study examined the TDI adoption
   determinants and the OIDI adoption intensity. Data were collected from
   1146 farmers (410, 382 and 354 in the milksheds of Mukurweini Wakulima
   Dairy Limited {[}MWDL], Happy Cow Limited {[}HCL] and New Kenya
   Co-operative Creameries {[}NKCC], respectively) and analysed using a
   double hurdle model. Access to credit positively influenced the TDI
   adoption in the three milksheds. Adoption of TDI was influenced by hired
   employees, dairy records, total dairy cows and household head education.
   The empirical evidence from the study supports the observation that OIDI
   adoption intensity is influenced by income, farm size, dairy records,
   and dairy information access. To boost TDI adoption, the dairy
   development partners should link cooperative society members with
   agricultural credit lenders. Additionally, the dissemination of dairy
   information to farmers by the dairy stakeholders could spur TDI
   adoption, while providing dairy information and training farmers on
   dairy record keeping should be promoted to boost TDI and OIDI adoption.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate if access to local
   branch infrastructure of the farm credit system institutions (FCS),
   banks and credit unions (BCU), and alternative financial services (AFS)
   providers is related to the use of credit from non-traditional lenders
   (NTLs). The focus is on beginning and women operators who are typically
   credit constrained and thus more likely to suffer from closures of bank
   branches and consolidation of traditional agricultural lenders.
   Design/methodology/approach Informed by Detragiache et al. (2000), the
   authors specify farmers' use of loans as a function of their access to
   credit (measured by the branch density of each lender type) along with
   operator's and operation's controls. The measures of loans by NTLs
   (number, use, share and lender type) require the use of Poisson, Probit,
   Tobit and Multinomial Logit techniques. This study utilizes individual
   producer data from the 2018 Agricultural Resource Management Survey and
   2018 county-level branch density data for FCS, BCU and AFS providers.
   Findings Access to credit from FCS is helpful to BFRs only, while access
   to AFS is associated with the use of loans from NTLs by women but not by
   BFRs. As expected, access to BCU credit matters for the use of loans
   from NTLs, with a complementary effect for BFRs but a substitution
   effect for women's use of such loans. Originality/value There are no
   studies on local agricultural credit markets in the US that evaluate the
   implications from changes in access to credit on credit-constrained
   borrowers and their use of NTLs' credit.},

Abstract = {This article stated that it is necessary that a kind of incentive and
   compatible institution arrangement and strategically cooperative
   relation is to be set up between the rural credit cooperatives and the
   local governments, which the former serves as local financial
   institutions. On the one hand, to seek survival and development in the
   fierce market competition, the rural credit cooperatives must orientate
   market in the ``three rural{''}-farmer, agriculture and rural area, and
   actively seek for the support of local government, actively and steadily
   push forward reform, strengthen coordination and cooperation with local
   governmental departments related, thus enhancing their service capacity;
   On the other hand, the local governments need raise awareness and change
   their functions, via the way of creating a good economic and credit
   environment and providing preferential policies to support and promote
   the development of the rural credit cooperatives, so as to achieve
   mutual benefits and win-win situation.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether a group of independent agricultural
   producers willingly forms a coalition to jointly cope with yield
   uncertainty in contract farming. The agricultural producers' cooperative
   game problem in contract farming is formulated as a two-stage stochastic
   linear program. Using the strong duality theory of stochastic linear
   programs, we not only prove that the core of agricultural producers'
   cooperative game is nonempty but also provide a simple way to compute a
   profit allocation policy in the core. We establish the convexity of
   agricultural producers' cooperative game so that the game has population
   monotonicity, which gives agricultural producers an incentive to expand
   their current coalition. We then analyze the agricultural producers'
   cooperative game with a concave cost structure, which may exhibit
   economies of scale for production. Taking advantage of the proposed
   stochastic duality approach, the agricultural producers' cooperative
   game with a concave cost structure is also shown to have a nonempty
   core.},

Abstract = {This article, building on the 5th principle of the Statement of the
   Cooperative Identity explores the practice of coeducating and learning
   behavior among the members of a dairy cooperative society. The study
   adopts a social network approach by focusing on two relational social
   ties: information sharing and advice-seeking. Building on a case of a
   55-year-old dairy cooperative in India, the social network analysis
   finds information-sharing relations among members to be inclusive, with
   no members isolated, and information exchanged along formal and
   knowledge hierarchies. Likewise, information sharing is horizontal, with
   information smoothly exchanged even among new and already established
   members, as is the transfer of leadership roles from the older members
   of the cooperatives to the younger members. Advice-seeking networks tend
   to be a bit more centralized toward board members and members exerting
   day-to-day leadership because of their knowledge and expertise regarding
   the organization and its policies. Our analysis suggests inclusive
   information sharing among members and a well-structured and functioning
   advice and knowledge-sharing network that contributes to learning of the
   cooperative members.},

Abstract = {Innovativeness is a decisive factor for a firm's performance since it
   reflects its capability to adapt to changing conditions. When
   behavioural innovativeness is concerned, the socially oriented
   activities of co-operatives suggest that specific values and behaviours
   within such organisations may influence their innovativeness. Hence,
   this research aims at better understanding how this co-operative
   difference impact on the co-operative innovativeness. In order to answer
   this objective, the research focused on the particular case of the
   Federation des caisses populaires acadiennes (FCPA), a Canadian
   second-level financial service co-operative, and 13 of its credit
   unions. A questionnaire was administered online to a population of 888
   employees, with a response rate of 65.1\% (578 respondents). The
   component analysis of 9 statements on behaviours and values oriented
   towards innovation and improvement resulted in two factors accounting
   for a satisfactory 62.5\% of the variance. The two factors represented
   components of the behavioural innovativeness in terms of the
   supervisor's transformational leadership, and team collaboration.
   Hypotheses were made suggesting the positive relationship between the
   two factors and behavioural innovativeness as expressed by the
   commitment of the employees towards the success of the cooperative and
   the improved quality of its services. Moreover, it was suggested that a
   cooperative difference, as perceived by the employees, would positively
   affect the relationship between the cultural factors and the behavioural
   innovativeness. Results of the structural analysis of the conceptual
   framework, using Lisrel 9, showed a significant and positive full
   mediation of the co-operative difference between the supervisor's
   transformational leadership and the co-operative behavioural, and a
   partial mediating role of the co-operative difference between team
   collaboration and behavioural innovativeness. These results are of
   interest for cooperative managers. With a focus on specific human
   resources practices aimed at enhancing an innovative culture at the
   management and the team levels, they could contribute to build a
   co-operative difference in the workforce and from these efforts, develop
   the organisational commitment towards innovation.},

Abstract = {This study estimated the actual and potential adoption rates of
   Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies, among smallholder maize
   farmers in rural northern Nigeria, using the treatment effect framework.
   The results revealed a significant overall adoption rate of 55\% of the
   targeted population while 83.5\% of the farmers were exposed to the ISM
   practices. With such an incomplete diffusion of the ISM technologies,
   the study estimated potential adoption rate to be 68.2\%, while the
   actual adoption (JEA) rate was estimated to be 58.3\% resulting in an
   adoption gap of 9.9\% due to incomplete diffusion/exposure. In addition,
   diffusion and adoption of ISM technologies were found to be influenced
   by factors such as famer's years of farming experience, total farm size
   under maize cultivation, cooperative society's membership, attendance of
   farm workshop/seminars, on-farm trials and field days among others.
   Policy implications for increase productivity and food security through
   ISM technology diffusion and adoption were discussed.},

Abstract = {Small boat fishers have often been characterized as uncooperative
   individualists resistant to forming and sustaining representative
   organizations. This essay argues that small boat fishers are a
   heterogeneous group expressive of divergent and often conflicting
   ideologies and behaviors. We contend that the character and play of
   these differences impact directly upon the dynamics in and outcomes for
   representative organizations such as producer cooperatives. As an
   exploration and demonstration of these factors, the essay examines
   aspects of small boat captains' engagement with and attitudes towards an
   eastern Nova Scotia producer cooperative. The notions `rugged
   individualism'' and `'utilitarian individualism'' are employed in an
   effort to conceptualize and analyze small boat fisher ideological and
   behavioral heterogeneity and its potential meanings for the success or
   failure of representative forms of organization.},

Abstract = {Purpose Extant literature indicates that people use existing social
   networks for various collective activities as there is a cost involved
   to create and maintain separate networks for different activities. The
   authors build on the relational sociology framework and test this
   assertion in by examining a dairy cooperative society, which is a
   community organization. We hypothesize that the cooperative members are
   likely to use existing social networks to operationalize their
   cooperative (dairy-related matters) and other social and personal
   relations. This study tests the hypothesis by studying information
   sharing relations among the dairy cooperative members in two different
   social networks: the dairy information network and social information
   network. Design/methodology/approach This study uses social network
   analysis to analyze relational data. Findings The study finds that the
   members of the dairy cooperative maintain both information sharing
   networks separately and that each network has different control and
   efficiency mechanisms. Originality/value The findings contradict the
   assertions of existing literature and establish that people ensure their
   business relations remain separated from their social relations to avoid
   the possibility of social conflicts affecting their business activities.},

Abstract = {Human talent management is a strategic area that over time has become
   important for the top management of the organization. People are
   considered as a key success factor and its objective is to involve
   personnel for institutional purposes. The objective of the proposed
   research is: to analyze the influence of human talent management on
   personnel turnover in the cooperative sector of segment 4 in the Ambato
   canton. The research has a qualitative-quantitative approach, of
   documentary and field design, with a correlational scope. A
   questionnaire composed of 13 questions that evaluates the variables of
   human talent management and personnel turnover was applied to a
   population of 122 workers from four COACs that agreed to participate in
   the study. The validity of the instrument is evaluated through
   Cronbach's Alpha coefficient and to analyze the correlation between the
   variable's human talent management and staff turnover, Spearman's method
   is applied. The analyzed indicators that have a greater incidence in the
   personnel turnover in the COACs of segment 4 in the Ambato canton are:
   payment of overtime, low incentives, poor performance evaluation, lack
   of professional development and inefficient communication; these
   evaluated indicators contribute to the disengagement of workers and high
   personnel turnover in the organizations.},

Journal = {INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article explores the women weavers of Manipur by using both
   qualitative and quantitative techniques. In mainstream India, males play
   the major role in weaving while women are involved in pre-weaving
   activity. In contrast to this, in the north-eastern states of India,
   especially Manipur, the weaving occupation is dominated by women, who
   often perform the dual roles of producer and trader. There are no power
   looms or cloth mills in the state even today, and these women weavers
   are to be credited for preserving Manipur's heritage by laboriously
   producing traditional textiles by hand. Globalisation and the opening of
   global markets may require their skills and knowledge to be upgraded to
   face the competition, and this study is an attempt to understand the
   world of the women weavers of Manipur in the context of a changing
   society. Their integral role in an industrially backward state is
   reflected in the lives of the 300 women selected for this study, which
   examines their socioeconomic conditions; the advantages and
   disadvantages associated with their working conditions; aspects of their
   health, wages and aspirations; their social relations with family and
   community; as well as the changing market structure, the technology used
   and production. Thus, an exploration of the women weavers' lives becomes
   a matter of acknowledging their contribution to society in the
   performance of their duties and roles according to their capacity,
   culture and traditions.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate market reaction to
   corporate governance reform pronouncements on board diversity in Kenyan
   listed firms. Design/methodology/approach An event study was performed
   using 240 days pre-event period and an event period that consisted of 25
   days pre and 25 days post the March 2016 board diversity reforms
   announcement in Kenya. The difference in differences (DiD) method was
   also used for cause-effect analysis for two years before and three years
   after the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement. The outcome
   variable was firm value, whereas the treatment and control groups were
   Kenyan listed firms and deposit-taking credit unions, respectively.
   Findings The event study method found cumulative abnormal returns after
   the date of the board diversity reforms announcement to be positive and
   significant. The DiD methods found a positive and significant market
   reaction to the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement in
   Kenya. Research limitations/implications This study was limited by the
   secondary data that was collected and analyzed from financial statements
   and stock price data from the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE).
   Financial statements have the disadvantage of being affected by the
   judgment and estimates of their preparers or accountants. Practical
   implications Emerging markets like the NSE are vulnerable to market
   manipulation by insiders. Efficient stock markets are known to attract
   more investors who are interested in a trustworthy stock price
   determination mechanism. The Capital Market Authority should thus
   continue implementing corporate governance reforms aimed at improving
   the efficiency of the NSE and the trustworthiness of stock prices
   therein. The continued reforms thus imply better value for money for the
   NSE investors. Originality/value This study makes an important
   contribution to literature by combining an event study and DiD analysis
   to assess market reaction to board diversity reform announcements in
   emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa which is a concept that has not
   been researched before. Past studies have used event studies to
   investigate the efficiency status of stock markets in sub-Saharan
   Africa, whereas the current study used an additional method of DiD and
   hence contributed to literature.},

Abstract = {Latvian dairy sector is characterized by low value added per employee
   and it can be considered as fragmented that results in weaker bargaining
   power and higher unproductive costs that do not add value to the
   products. But it is also considered that in concentrating product supply
   and also demand logistics plays an important role: helps to reduce
   unproductive costs and serves as an instrument to add product place and
   time value. Therefore the paper looks at the economic conditions of the
   Latvian dairy sector and the practice and economic benefits of the
   developed logistics systems and components. Milk collecting and
   marketing are basic and the most important activities of the Latvian
   dairy sector logistics systems. Dairy sector cooperative societies of
   Latvia have developed the strongest logistics systems that have improved
   the situation of dairy farmers in Latvia, with the largest gain being
   higher milk price. The logistics systems of the largest cooperatives
   also engage in the supply of production inputs.},

Abstract = {The present study examines the adoption and impact assessment of Direct
   Seeded Rice technology in terms of input use, cost-effectiveness, and
   addressing the sustainability issues at the farm level in Sri Muktsar
   Sahib District of Punjab using primary data. Input use pattern revealed
   saving of 56.27 and 51.23 percent in human labour in basmati DSR and
   non-basmati DSR. The machine labour saving in basmati and non-basmati
   was 28.47 and 37.79 percent respectively with DSR. Results brought out
   that saving in the number of irrigations for basmati DSR and non-basmati
   DSR were 50 and 43 percent respectively. The per ha total variable cost
   in basmati DSR was lower ((sic)22032) when compared with TM ((sic)27682)
   and in non-basmati per ha total variable cost in non-basmati DSR
   ((sic)22246) was also lower when compared with TM ((sic)29376). The
   returns per rupee spend on basmati TM was (sic)3.32 against (sic)4.17 in
   DSR and in non-basmati returns per rupee spend on TM was (sic)3.90
   against (sic)5.22 in DSR. In the case of DSR, there was no significant
   difference in yield between DSR and TM of basmati as well as
   non-basmati. The study suggested that for faster adoption of DSR, the
   subsidy should be made hassle-free, the role of extension services need
   to be strengthened. Custom hiring should be increased through
   co-operative societies and co-farmers keeping in view the high cost of
   seed drill.},

Abstract = {Sourcing the right quality and quantity of agricultural inputs such as
   seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, constitutes a crucial aspect of
   agricultural input operations. This is a particularly challenging
   problem being faced by the small and marginal farmers in any emerging
   economy. Farmer collectives (FCs) which are cooperative societies of
   farmers, launched under Federal Government initiatives in many
   countries, offer the prospect of enabling cost-effective procurement of
   inputs with assured quality. We seek, in this work, sound and
   explainable mechanisms for the above important use-case. In particular,
   we propose the use of incentive compatible auction mechanisms that could
   be used by an FC to procure quality inputs in bulk. The idea is the
   following. An FC collects from the farmers their individual requirements
   for inputs and aggregates them into different buckets. For each bucket,
   the FC identifies suppliers who meet the quality criteria and engages
   them in a competitive procurement auction. We explore in this paper, two
   particular types of procurement auctions: volume discount auctions and
   combinatorial auctions in the framework of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
   mechanisms. These are explainable mechanisms that induce truthful bids
   from the suppliers as well as maximize the social welfare. We show their
   efficacy through carefully designed thought experiments. Our field
   studies of FCs give us the confidence that such mechanisms, if deployed
   systematically, can become a game changer, benefiting a massive
   community of smallholder farmers.},

Title = {The changing role of accounting: From consumers to shareholders},
Journal = {CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ACCOUNTING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {86-101},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From the view of accounting as a social, political and institutional
   practice, this study examines the processes of accounting change as a
   State-sponsored consumer co-operative transformed to a private sector
   company pursuing profitability and value creation for shareholders.
   Accounting policy and practice were important aspects of the
   institutional and regulatory logics as the organisation changed from an
   entity focused on community service obligations to one that was profit
   driven. The State was the main factor/agent enabling this change. We
   frame our study within institutional theory and the political economy of
   accounting. We use institutional theory to inform our understanding of
   the institutional terrain and the political economy of accounting to
   understand the power and coercion of the State. Accounting rules and
   practices were co-opted to provide legitimacy, resistance, institutional
   logic, coercive change, and to redistribute wealth and power in society.

Abstract = {This paper explores the consumer role in marketplace transformation by
   examining how political consumers become produced in food retailing. It
   attends to situated representational practices in a Swedish consumer
   cooperative that seeks to strengthen consumer voice in markets.
   Combining notions of political and symbolic representations, the paper
   demonstrates the production of spokespersons for the cooperatives'
   owners who, in turn, work to engage other consumers to voice and enact
   concerns in the cooperative. Four stages of representational practices
   are identified: (s)electing, equipping,engaging, and enacting. These
   practices are conceptualised as part of processes of agencing and
   concerning: (s)electing and equipping work to arrange consumer agencies,
   while engaging and enacting refer to ways of concerning others that put
   agencies into motion. Agencies are proposed as liquid in character and
   the capacity of consumers to shape markets comes into effect depending
   upon how agencies continuously become connected to each other.},

Abstract = {An economic enterprise faces two, related, problems: effectively
   managing its activities and communicating to outsiders that it is, in
   fact, well run. The credit cooperative movement that grew up in Germany
   in the second half of the nineteenth century had to wrestle with both.
   These cooperatives thrived, in part, because they adopted strategies
   first to obtain and then to harness the information they needed about
   the communities in which they were located, giving them an advantage
   over other lenders. Particularly effective was the tactic of using local
   people as managers, which helped to cement their ties with the
   community. Yet because few, if any, locals had banking experience and
   most were not even familiar with basic accounting methods, the managers
   created internal management problems, intensifying outside suspicion of
   the cooperatives as banking enterprises. The methods the cooperatives
   developed to overcome these problems drew on a combination of local
   initiative and regional assistance that was typical of the movement as a

Abstract = {We evaluate two models that may explain variation in the inclusiveness
   of governments and their ability to provision public goods. The revenue
   model predicts that a government's source of revenue determines whether
   elites invest in effective bureaucracy and the provision of public goods
   that benefit wide swaths of society or the extraction of resources from
   society to benefit a limited network. In this model, a cooperative
   society with high social capital is an outcome of effective, collective
   government. The combined model predicts that social capital has a
   semi-independent causal effect, in addition to revenue, on the
   inclusiveness of governments. Our results indicate that the combined
   model of collective governance fits the data on U.S. states better than
   the revenue model alone. The combined model of governance predicts that
   revenue and social capital moderate the population size-political
   complexity relationship, and data from the U.S. states are consistent
   with these predictions.},

Abstract = {The study identified the environmental factors affecting artisanal
   fishing in Eastern Obolo local government area of Akwa Ibom state,
   Nigeria. Ninety artisanal fishermen were selected using two-stage
   sampling techniques. Questionnaire and interview schedule was used to
   get information. The research objectives were analyzed using frequency,
   percentages and mean. On the socioeconomics characteristics of the
   artisanal fishermen, it was found that the majority (58\%) of the
   respondents were male with 36\% of the respondents having secondary
   school as their highest level of education. Also 31\% have fishing
   experience of below10 years with yearly fish output of above 1000kg by
   31\% of the respondents and yearly income of greater than N200,000 by
   53\% of the respondents while 81\% belong to co-operative society.
   Extension agents have visited none of the respondents. The major
   environmental factors affecting artisanal fishing in the area were oil
   spillage (100\%), waste disposal (100\%) and climatic factors (100\%).
   On the constraints faced, the study found out that militant activities,
   inadequate finance, oil spillage around depots, and poor sales were
   found to be serious. Based on the findings of the study, it was
   recommended that, the Government and other appropriate authorities
   should enforce the fishing laws and regulations to avoid illegal
   exploitation of fishing grounds by trawlers and the destruction of
   artisanal fishing gears. Also, better access to relevant information
   should be enhanced by making extension services available to fish
   farmers in the various depots},

Title = {Resilience of Traditional Livelihood Approaches Despite Forest Grabbing:
   Ogiek to the West of Mau Forest, Uasin Gishu County},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {This paper is a summary of the findings of research work conducted in
   two case studies in the Rift Valley, Kenya. This study used the
   Neo-Institutional theory to interrogate how the rules and regulations
   (institutions involved) of the agrarian reform process in Kenya are
   constantly changing and helping to shape the livelihoods of social
   actors around Mau Forest. The first case study-Ndungulu, is a settlement
   scheme where the Ogiek ethnic community were resettled between 1995 and
   1997 after the land clashes of 1992. The second case study is the Kamuyu
   cooperative farm, a post-colonial settlement scheme owned by a
   cooperative society that was founded in 1965 by members from the Kikuyu
   ethnic group. This study employed qualitative data collection methods
   intermittently between 2012 and 2017 for a total of two years. A total
   of 60 interviews were conducted for this research. Thirteen (13) of
   these were key informant interviews with experts on land. The
   qualitative interviews were complemented by participant observations and
   nine focus group discussions. The qualitative data from the interviews
   and focus group discussions were transcribed, coded and analyzed
   thematically. Observations documented as field notes were also analyzed
   to complement the study findings. In this paper, the challenges,
   bargaining position and power play between social actors and government
   institutions implicated in the agrarian reform process in Kenya has been
   brought to the forefront. For instance, due to the structural issues
   that date back to the colonial period, the Ogiek have found innovative
   ways to maintain their daily existence (e.g., maintaining traditional
   methods of apiculture in Mau Forest). However, constraints in accessing
   forest land has resulted in them taking desperate measures, namely;
   selling off land to the Kalenjin in what is called ``distress land
   sales{''}. On the contrary, the neighboring Kikuyu have maintained their
   land ownership status despite recurrent ethnic clashes that have
   occurred during general election years.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to analyze the technical efficiency of
   Saving and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) and the impact for SACCOs'
   health using primary data obtained from a survey of 178 respondents of
   SACCOs in East Java, Indonesia. The three stages of the analysis used
   are Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Tobit Regression and Logistic
   Regression. Based on the results of the analysis using the DEA method,
   it is concluded that the average performance that can be achieved by
   SACCOs with existing technology is 65 \% of the maximum potential yield.
   There are 61.3 \% of SACCOs which are declared technically inefficient.
   The factors that influence the level of technical efficiency of Saving
   and Credit Cooperatives are interest, loan term, manager's age, and type
   of business. Furthermore, the factors that affect the health of the
   cooperative based on logistics analysis are the variable frequency of
   management meetings, age of the cooperative, fixed deposits and average
   loan. This study supports the SACCOs in becoming more efficient and
   healthy with the influence of external policy (from government) and
   internal policy (from SACCOs).},

Title = {Socioeconomic assessment of flooding among farm households in Anambra
   state, Nigeria},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-111},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the extent of
   agricultural losses incurred by the farm households due to flood; to
   assess the farm households gender-based vulnerability to flood; to
   identify the coping strategies used by them; and to estimate factors
   that drive the choice of these coping strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using both purposive and simple random
   sampling techniques, the paper selected 120 farm households from the
   flood prone areas of the state, using the list of the State Agricultural
   Development Project (ADP) contact farmers as a sampling frame. Data for
   the paper were collected using a set of structured and pre-tested
   questionnaire. The information collected included the extent of
   agricultural losses incurred by the farm households, farm household's
   level of asset base, flood coping strategies adopted by the farmers and
   so on. The data were collected in August 2013.
   Findings - More than 70 per cent of the farmers' farmlands were affected
   by flood, resulting in more than 80 per cent of their staple crops
   (cassava, rice, yam, maize and vegetables) and livestock (sheep/goat and
   chicken) being lost. Women were generally more vulnerable than men to
   the effect of flood. Selling of assets, borrowing of loans to diversify
   the means of livelihood, short-term migration, support from social
   network, compensation of losses from National and/or State Emergency
   Management Agencies, planting of agro-forestry trees, change of date of
   planting, land terracing, construction of drainages, cover cropping and
   making of ridges across slop constituted the flood coping strategies of
   the farmers. On the factors influencing the choice of these coping
   strategies, the level of education of the household head, frequency of
   extension visits in a year and tenure security status were positively
   and significantly related with land and crop management strategies, such
   as planting of agro-forestry trees, planting of cover crops and
   construction of drainages across farmland. Age, access to credit, farm
   size and membership of cooperative societies had negative relationships
   with selling of assets and short-term migration. In addition, membership
   of cooperative societies and flood experience were positively and
   significantly related with institutional measures, such as support from
   social network and National and State Emergency Management Agencies.
   These observations underscore the need for training, cooperatives and
   enhanced farm capacity (credit and farm size) in coping with flood by
   the farmers. It is recommended that governments and non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) should assist the farmers in these regards.
   Originality/value - Climate change induced flooding has become a
   developmental issue across the world. As countries continue to be hit by
   massive flooding, food production also continues to be hit adversely.
   Nigeria has joined this league because of the rampage flooding across
   the country in recent times. Anambra State is down stream of both rivers
   Niger and Benue and, hence, one of the states vulnerable to flooding in
   Nigeria. Available literature suggests that greater efforts have been
   made to quantify the economic implications of flooding on agriculture
   and the concomitant coping strategies in developed than in developing
   countries. This paper, therefore, assesses the extent of losses suffered
   by farm households, their level of vulnerability and flood coping
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Rural Savings and Credit Cooperatives (RuSACCOs) are small-scale
   financial service provider enterprises in rural areas. They foster local
   economic development by mobilizing deposits and lending these out to
   individuals, families, farmers, and small businesses in the same area.
   Using balanced panel data of 457 RuSACCOs from Ethiopia over the period
   2014-17, we show how deposit mobilization affects technical efficiency.
   Our first stage efficiency estimate by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
   Window model shows the average efficiency of RuSACCOs gradually
   increased over time. The second stage Tobit censored estimation and
   bootstrapped truncated regression results confirms our hypotheses for
   key and control variables effects on technical efficiency. Focusing on
   rapid expansion during the early life cycle affects technical
   efficiency. A high percentage of women membership in cooperative
   enterprises advances technical efficiency. Furthermore, attracting and
   including all segments of the local entrepreneurial class as a
   membership opens the possibilities for mobilizing more deposits to
   become efficient.},

Abstract = {Extensive research has explored the style exposures of actively managed
   equity funds. We conducted an exhaustive set of return-based and
   holdings-based analyses to understand actively managed credit funds. We
   found that credit long-short managers tend to have high passive exposure
   to the credit risk premium. In contrast, we found that long-only
   managers that focus on high-yield credits provide less exposure to the
   credit risk premium than do their respective benchmarks. For both credit
   hedge funds and long-only credit mutual funds, we found that neither has
   economically meaningful exposures to well-compensated systematic
   factors.

Title = {Embeddedness, social capital and learning in rural areas: The case of
   producer cooperatives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {101-110},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To pursue development goals, policymakers and scholars alike have
   proposed that actors in rural areas may usefully engage in collective
   actions, e.g. by forming community groups, producer associations or
   multi-actor networks. One proposed benefit of such collaborations is the
   enhanced knowledge exchange and learning which may be created, and in
   the literature the dynamics of this are often explained via the concepts
   of embeddedness and/or social capital. To date however, studies tend
   towards a somewhat narrow, territorial, interpretation of these
   concepts, with the result that current understanding of how
   collaborations and learning evolve between rural actors is rather
   constrained. This paper aims to explore a broader interpretation of
   these concepts, through case analysis of a producer cooperative in the
   Scottish shellfish sector. In the case, the realities of member and
   management relations are revealed, along with the types of knowledge
   generated and the processes by which these are, or are not, shared
   between actors. In terms of embeddedness, our analysis reveals that,
   rather than the local community context which tends to dominate the
   literature, it is sectoral norms and habits which shape actor relations
   and learning most significantly in this case. In terms of social
   capital, we identify that tension fuelled social relations are not in
   themselves a barrier to collaboration, again in contrast to existing
   claims, particularly where key actors have appropriate interpersonal
   skills, and where a values-based mindset ('cooperative know-how') is
   held in common. The findings therefore challenge popular assumptions
   about how embeddedness and social capital shape collective action and
   learning in rural areas, and illustrate the value of interpreting these
   concepts more expansively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To stay ahead of their competitors, firms need to create and develop
   proactive strategies that emphasize factors that differentiate them from
   others in their sector. In this sense and given the current scenario of
   marketplace instability and uncertainty, the way firms develop and
   manage their intellectual capital (IC) is crucial. Firms can be
   distinguished from their rivals in terms of their ability to identify,
   invest in and manage their IC - in other words the knowledge over which
   they exercise control or influence - an intangible asset that is not as
   easily quantifiable or replicable as other assets. In today's globalized
   and highly competitive world, the only way to compete with producers
   benefiting from low production costs is to invest in people, and this
   requires organizations to believe in the creative ability, emotional
   intelligence and adaptability of their staff and collaborators. Human
   resources with appropriate skills, motivation and commitment are the key
   to increased competitiveness because only they have the capacity to
   create products and services with greater value for the consumer and
   thereby generate better performance by the organization. Numerous
   studies have highlighted the role of IC as a key driver of
   organizational performance due to its centrality as an asset in the
   value creation process (Chen, Shih and Yang, 2009; Kang and Snell, 2009;
   Campisini and Costa, 2008). However, few studies have demonstrated the
   relationship that may be developed between various aspects of IC and the
   satisfaction felt by the staff involved (Longo and Mura, 2011). Employee
   satisfaction (in general) and promotion opportunities expressing
   organizational recognition of staff contributions (in particular)
   provide a stimulus to greater committed to the organization's interests
   and thereby enhance productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. Clearly,
   since human resources (HR) constitute the only asset that, strictly
   speaking, the organization does not own, and that the time and money it
   spends on training can easily be wasted if staff turnover is high, it is
   crucial for 21st century organizations of all types to attract, develop
   and above all retain qualified, committed and satisfied staff. Our focus
   on Credit Cooperatives (CC) is explained by their emergence as a
   significant alternative to large financial corporations - especially
   private banks. CCs are able to offer specific and attractive benefits to
   their members and can play a key role in stimulating socioeconomic
   development at the territorial level (Araujo and Silva, 2011; Segui-Mas
   and Izquierdo, 2010). The aims of the research reported on here were (1)
   to identify which aspects of IC most influence employee satisfaction in
   the financial institutions analyzed and (2) to specify the type of
   influence these dimensions have on staff satisfaction. Data were
   collected using a questionnaire based on Bontis (1998) applied to all
   employees of a CC in north-eastern Brazil. After processing the data
   using SPSS 21.0, it was found that (1) Human Capital is not an
   unidimensional concept and was further subdivided into training and
   participation; and (2) only structural and relational dimensions of IC
   affected respondents' satisfaction positively. By making known to
   organizational leaders and managers that there exists a link - albeit
   indirect - between IC and organizational performance may encourage them
   to invest more in an intangible asset that has the intrinsic ability to
   create sustainable flows of value for both client and organization.},

Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that although reconciliation between livelihood
   improvement and biodiversity conservation for sustainable development is
   complex and difficult, it is feasible to attain such a goal. One such
   experiment was carried out in southeast Brazil to protect mangroves and
   livelihood enhancement through the development of an oyster producers'
   cooperative. By employing a mix of qualitative research methods,
   including a variety of Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques, we found
   that institutional initiative for innovative oyster-rearing techniques
   and the development of the local-level organization were crucial for
   reconciliation of income enhancement with conservation. The examination
   of how development and innovation interventions can lead to sustainable
   development has revealed that the state of ``capabilities{''} and their
   expansion is at the core of sustainable livelihood opportunities and
   ecological systems. The Cananeia Cooperative experiment evidently
   supports these assertions.},

Title = {Demand Side Energy Management via Multiagent Coordination in Consumer
   Cooperatives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {885-922},
Abstract = {A key challenge in creating a sustainable and energy-efficient society
   is to make consumer demand adaptive to the supply of energy, especially
   to the renewable supply. In this article, we propose a
   partially-centralized organization of consumers (or agents), namely, a
   consumer cooperative that purchases electricity from the market. In the
   cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole
   group. The technical challenge is that consumers make their own demand
   decisions, based on their private demand constraints and preferences,
   which they do not share with the coordinator or other agents. We propose
   a novel multiagent coordination algorithm, to shape the energy demand of
   the cooperative. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete
   information, the coordinator determines virtual price signals that it
   sends to the consumers to induce them to shift their demands when
   required. We prove that this algorithm converges to the central optimal
   solution and minimizes the electric energy cost of the cooperative.
   Additionally, we present results on the time complexity of the iterative
   algorithm and its implications for agents' incentive compatibility.
   Furthermore, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data
   to (a) characterize the convergence properties of our algorithm and (b)
   understand the effect of differing demand characteristics of
   participants as well as of different price functions on the cost
   reduction. The results show that the convergence time scales linearly
   with the agent population size and length of the optimization horizon.
   Finally, we observe that as participants' flexibility of shifting their
   demands increases, cost reduction increases and that the cost reduction
   is not sensitive to variation in consumption patterns of the consumers.},

Abstract = {The small scale forestry carbon project in Haryana, India has been
   registered as a Clean Development Project (CDM) activity and is the
   first such projects from India. Developed under the Kyoto Protocol of
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the
   projects aims at restoring heavily degraded sandune affected private
   lands and contribute to climate change mitigation. The project is
   expected to sequester 234,584 tons of carbon dioxide (tCO(2)) in 20
   years project cycle with an average annual sequestration of 11,729
   (tCO2) per year. The project is expected to have a total carbon stock of
   385,253.1 ton Carbon (tC) in the project life span of 20 years as
   against 7,920.6 (tC) in the baseline scenario. The carbon credits earned
   from the project is supposed to provide additional incentives to the
   smallholders who have formed a cooperative society for this purpose.
   This paper addresses the issues and challenges in developing the project
   activity and also discusses the lessons learned in the process. The
   project is supposed to help in poverty alleviation and has become a
   success story for rehabilitating degraded lands in semi arid regions of
   India through plantation forestry.},

Title = {Measuring the Effectiveness of the Project Management Information System

   Districts of Uttarakhand, India: An IS-FW Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The study aims to measure the effectiveness of the project management
   information system (PMIS) and its impact on financial wellness in rural
   areas. The study uses DeLone and McLean's updated information success
   model to measure the net impacts of the PMIS on the community. The
   dynamics between the PMIS and financial wellness have not yet been
   clarified, as the available literature on the concerned domain is very
   limited; thus, further research is required to report the effect of the
   PMIS on financial wellness. A total of 628 samples were analyzed from
   666 collected through structured questionnaires and stratified sampling
   from 21 hill blocks from the hills of Uttarakhand.
   Exploratory-confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis were both
   conducted using SPSS and AMOS. The study found that PMIS quality,
   information quality, and service quality are significantly important for
   the PMIS, and its impact on the net benefits derived from PMIS was
   studied. The results also reveal that the net benefits of the system
   impact the financial behavior and financial attitudes of SHGs and
   cooperative members, consequently significantly impacting financial
   wellness. This study proposes and tests the information system (IS)
   financial wellness (FW) model for community-based development programs
   in the lines of the logical framework approach and the
   stimulus-organism-response framework.},

Abstract = {The efficient size of agricultural banks is an issue that will remain
   important for the rest of the 1990s. Consolidation that is occurring in
   the financial services industry has spilled over into agricultural
   banking. This has raised concerns as to whether banks that have
   traditionally supplied credit to production agriculture will continue to
   do so after consolidation. Another major concern is whether
   consolidation is motivated by greater efficiency, or whether
   consolidation is resulting in greater market power without achieving
   cost savings. Study of the production technology of financial
   institutions can determine whether and to what degree economies of size
   exist and how agricultural lending will fit into the overall business
   plans of consolidated banks. Generally, empirical studies have used
   either duality theory with the estimation of cost functions or
   nonparametric estimation methods to assess efficiency in the financial
   services industry. The purpose of the present study is to estimate
   economies of scope and scale in agricultural banking. This will be
   accomplished through estimation of an indirect multi-product cost
   function. The uniqueness of this study, when compared to previous
   studies of efficiency of the financial services industry, i's the
   disaggregation of the outputs so that agricultural lending can be
   evaluated. In addition, a normalized quadratic cost function is
   estimated with curvature properties imposed.
   Clark reviewed thirteen studies that measured economies of scope and
   scale for commercial banks, credit unions, and savings and loan
   associations. He found that they offered four broad conclusions: (a)
   overall economies of scale exist at low levels of input, (b) no
   consistent evidence of economies of scope exists, (c) some evidence of
   cost complementarities exists, and (d) the results seem to be robust
   among financial institutions. Humphery also reviewed studies that
   examine the issue of economies of scale for banks and found that little
   cost savings exist for increases in size alone. He concluded that
   significant benefits accrue from loan diversification. Humphery also
   reported that the differences in cost structure within the same firm
   size category are larger than measured cost economies.
   Berger, Hunter, and Timme reviewed the efficiency of financial
   institutions. They discovered that many of the previous studies showed
   the average cost curve to be relatively flat. They also suggested that
   differences in technologies may occur between small and large banks or
   that some factor that varies with bank size may be excluded from
   previous studies. McAllister and McManus found that the translog cost
   function specification gives a poor approximation when applied to all
   bank sizes, suggesting that nonparametric estimation procedures should
   be examined. In addition, they included risk as a cost factor in the
   estimation. Berger, Hunter, and Timme suggested that, although frontier
   estimation methods are theoretically correct, studies that have compared
   results of frontier methods to those of more traditional estimation
   methods have found only small differences for scale measures.},

Abstract = {Self-interest frequently causes individuals engaged in joint enterprises
   to choose actions that are counterproductive. Free-riders can invade a
   society of cooperators, causing a tragedy of the commons. Such social
   dilemmas can be overcome by positive or negative incentives. Even though
   an incentive-providing institution may protect a cooperative society
   from invasion by free-riders, it cannot always convert a society of
   free-riders to cooperation. In the latter case, both norms, cooperation
   and defection, are stable: To avoid a collapse to full defection,
   cooperators must be sufficiently numerous initially. A society of
   free-riders is then caught in a social trap, and the institution is
   unable to provide an escape, except at a high, possibly prohibitive
   cost. Here, we analyze the interplay of (a) incentives provided by
   institutions and (b) the effects of voluntary participation. We show
   that this combination fundamentally improves the efficiency of
   incentives. In particular, optional participation allows institutions
   punishing free-riders to overcome the social dilemma at a much lower
   cost, and to promote a globally stable regime of cooperation. This
   removes the social trap and implies that whenever a society of
   cooperators cannot be invaded by free-riders, it will necessarily become
   established in the long run, through social learning, irrespective of
   the initial number of cooperators. We also demonstrate that punishing
   provides a ``lighter touch{''} than rewarding, guaranteeing full
   cooperation at considerably lower cost.},

   between the model of people management and the availability for sharing
   information. Therefore, it was adopted as a methodological design
   conducting a case study on a Credit Cooperative Singular, in the State
   of Minas Gerais, using documentary analysis, semi structured interviews
   and focus groups. The results evidence there is a significant
   relationship between people management model used and the availability
   for the sharing information. Moreover, it was noticed that a model of
   people management based on control strategies tends to hamper the
   sharing often creating in organizations, political behavior and the use
   of individual strategies of the use of information for career
   development and to reach their individual goals.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between Enterprise Risk Management
   (ERM) and accounting, focusing on the role of ethical variables in
   supporting strategic planning within Italian mutual credit cooperative
   banks. After the recent failures the introduction of ethics in risk
   management practices could contribute to the alignment between the
   objectives of the firms and their stakeholders. This study is supported
   by holistic case study of Banca di Credito Cooperativo di Napoli, as the
   most representative mutual credit cooperative bank of the South of
   Italy. Drawing on Glaser and Strauss (1967), we adopt grounded theory
   methodology in order to explain how ethics influences either ERM
   practices or accounting practices. This paper makes a contribution to
   existing literature giving evidence of the ability of a consolidated
   ethical Enterprise Risk Management process to lead the accounting
   practices toward the area of social accounting.},

Abstract = {The accounting history literature has mostly concentrated on depicting
   how accountability practices evolve with respect to the organisational
   and social contexts, leaving at the margins explorations of the role of
   the `accountable self' in this process. To extend this literature, the
   present study examines how the economist and landowner Leone Wollemborg
   (1859-1932) acted as an `accountable self', explaining his own actions
   to the `other', to promote a new organisational model aimed at solving
   the credit issue affecting the rural population. Based on archival
   material, the article explores Wollemborg's biography and develops a
   content analysis of his discourses. The findings show that, by making a
   pervasive use of face-to-face narrative accountability, Wollemborg
   obtained trust and engagement of external potential stakeholders, thus
   expanding the rural credit cooperatives (Raiffeisen-style). This
   research facilitates understanding of the relevance for the initiator of
   a new organisational model to act as an `accountable self'.},

Title = {Cognition Beyond Representation: Varieties of Situated Cognition in
   Animals},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE COGNITION \& BEHAVIOR REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {The notion that cognition comprises more than computations of a central
   nervous system operating on representations has gained a foothold in
   human cognitive science for a few decades now. Various brands of
   embodied, extended, enacted, and distributed cognition, some more
   conservative and some more liberal, have paraded in philosophy and
   cognitive science. I call the genus including all such species situated
   cognition and go on to depict selected cases in nonhuman comparative
   cognition. Distributed cognition is often used as another term for
   situated cognition. But behavioral biologists have used the term in
   another sense, to mean the reduction of cognitive capacities arising
   from team work in cooperative societies. Hymenopteran insects have been
   studied as cases. The octopus displays embodied cognition, with some of
   the computational work offloaded to the periphery. Web-building spiders
   showcase extended cognition, in which objects external to the animal-the
   web, in the case of spiders-play a crucial causal role in cognition. A
   criterion of mutual manipulability, in which causal influence flows both
   ways between organism and extended object, serves to delimit the scope
   of extended cognition. Play in dogs features intelligence on-the-run,
   arising out of action, a key characteristic of enactive cognition. I
   discuss other cases in which action entwines with central
   representational cognition to achieve goal-directed behavior.
   Considering situated cognition in diverse animals leads to myriad
   research questions that can enrich the field.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop and illustrate a generally
   applicable approach on how scales for marketing constructs can
   adequately be developed for application in diverse cultural contexts,
   and to illustrate the approach in the development of market orientation
   measurement for seed producer cooperatives (SPCs) context in Ethiopia.
   Both cross-context comparable items and context-specific items are
   included. Results show that an instrument for measuring market
   orientation in the specific context combines both general and
   context-specific items. Market orientation in the context is a
   multidimensional construct consisting of four dimensions: customer,
   competitor and supplier orientation, and interfunctional coordination.
   SPCs and organizations that aim to support SPCs can use the market
   orientation measure to monitor the progress of SPCs toward successful
   commercial enterprises.},

Abstract = {Food processing industries are assuming greater importance and processed
   food is now not a matter of choice but it is a necessity. As a result
   there is greater awareness of safety concerns, emerging risks and
   challenges in the context of food products. Consumers want guarantees
   for food characteristics, thus, calling for transparency and effective
   response in case of any food related health problem. This paper presents
   a framework for transparency, traceability and information flow for
   management of dairy supply chain networks. This paper follows a case
   study approach and presents findings from three types of dairy supply
   chains as prevalent in India. The paper analyses complexity of dairy
   products as well as processes in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic
   factors and their effects on the underlying dairy supply chain networks
   (DSCN). Governance mechanisms dovetailing various stages of the DSCN are
   presented in terms of their gaps and adequacy. Key components of the
   presented frameworks are harmonization of national standards with codex
   standards, hygiene control, strengthening quality control systems,
   enhancing information flow across stages, animal health care, disease
   free zones and formation of cooperatives of small dairy processors
   (CSDP) in line with the present dairy cooperative society (DCS). CSDP
   aims at collective action and public-private partnerships by the
   unorganized sector units to face the competition from large organized
   processors of dairy products in terms of quality, transparency,
   traceability and information flow. Transparency of a DSCN is the extent
   to which all its stakeholders have a shared understanding of and access
   to the product related information without loss, noise, delay and
   distortion. Given the perishable nature of dairy products, an effective
   traceability system is an important tool not only to manage food quality
   and safety risks, but also to promote the development of effective dairy
   supply chain management. This paper contributes to the nascent
   literature on transparency and traceability issues of dairy supply chain
   networks. Findings would be useful for policy makers in framing
   standards and effective regulations. Analysis of complexity would be
   useful for dairy industry managers.},

Title = {Successful Niche Building by Social Innovation in Social Economy
   Networks and the Potential for Societal Transformation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {As current evolutions make the social economy increasingly visible and
   important, the paper examines the role of networking in social economy
   initiatives in strengthening their innovativeness capacities, and, thus,
   increasing their potential for societal transformation. Our analytical
   framework reflects the different clusters of networking relations within
   and outside social economy initiatives, as well as the roles of
   cognitive frames, skills and capacities, governance, activities, and
   funding under each of these networking clusters. This analysis is then
   applied in a particular social economy initiative, Cretamo, a consumers'
   cooperative operating a grocery store in Thessaloniki, Greece. The
   results indicate that Cretamo has developed in the central node of an
   eco-system of same-minded social enterprises in the agro-food sector,
   offering an alternative niche to the mainstream economic model. This has
   changed relations both within the initiative and in its networks, while,
   at the same time, allows for increased innovativeness capacities.
   Cretamo has not yet the power to challenge the existing mainstream
   regime. Yet, it offers a valid alternative niche, which, combined with
   the socio-economic crisis still experienced in Greece and expected to
   intensify in the future, creates strong potential for societal
   transformation.},

Title = {Adoption and diffusion of improved technologies and production practices
   in agriculture: Insights from a donor-led intervention in Nepal},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Adoptions of improved technologies and production practices are
   important drivers of agricultural development in low-income countries
   like Nepal. Adopting a broad class of such technologies and practices is
   often critical for meeting the multifaceted goals of efficiency,
   profitability, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience.
   This study aims to address the knowledge gaps that still exist
   concerning what determines the adoption of improved technologies and
   production practices, the factors affecting their diffusion, the impact
   of interventions on productivity and crops grown, and the variability of
   impact within a particular country context. In this paper we address
   these questions using data collected as part of the USAID-led
   Knowledge-Based Integrated Sustainable Agriculture in Nepal (KISAN)
   project. We adopted a multistage sampling technique and surveyed 988
   beneficiary households and 997 non-beneficiary households in KISAN
   intervention districts and non-intervention districts. Our findings
   suggest that, in Nepal, adoption of improved technologies and practices
   is significantly increased by improved access to markets, private sector
   involvement in selling improved seeds and disseminating information,
   membership in progressive farmers groups and cooperative societies,
   participation in agricultural training and farm visits, provision of
   subsidies for seeds, and access to credit. We also found the probability
   of the adoption of improved practices to be affected by farmers' sources
   of information; for instance, the adoption of improved practices was
   increased when farmers obtained information from informal sources,
   cooperatives/farmers organizations, and public and private extension
   programs. The effects of KISAN projects vary significantly across the
   different crops grown, based on the evaluation models that address
   self-selection of both project participation and crop choices. These
   implications may also apply to other parts of the world facing similar
   challenges as Nepal, where limited market access, insufficient knowledge
   and resource capacity of farmers constrain their adoption of improved
   technologies and practices in agriculture.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the formal institutional arrangements currently in
   force in Chinese rural credit co-operatives (RCCs). In particular, it
   analyses the legal position of the RCCs, the regulations concerning
   property rights, the specific features of co-operatives, the disparity
   between formal supervisory institutional arrangements and the actual
   implementation process, as well as the arrangements for the
   self-regulatory system, all of which suffer major shortcomings. In order
   to promote the secure and healthy development of the RCCs while strictly
   controlling their operational risks, the author considers that the
   Chinese supervisory authorities should accelerate the establishment of a
   new regulatory framework, which should he based on the reappraisal of
   the existing regulatory framework and on RCCs' ongoing institutional
   reforms. To this end, the author discusses how to further the reform of
   property rights system of the RCCs, how to strengthen and improve the
   supervisory system on market access, business operations, the provision
   of assistance with regard to liquidity risks and withdrawal from the
   market, and how to clarify the relationship between supervisory
   authorities and the RCCs.},

Abstract = {Savings and credit cooperatives are socioeconomic entities with the
   capacity to meet the economic needs of their members and influence the
   welfare of the community and society through effective and efficient
   administrative processes, while respecting the principles and values of
   the international cooperative movement. In Ecuador, these types of
   entities are part of the social and solidarious economy sector in the
   financial sphere and play an important role, since they achieve equity
   in access to financial resources in an environment where large banking
   institutions prevail. The objective of the research was to analyze the
   internal control process of the 14 Savings and Credit Cooperatives of
   the canton ``La Mana{''}, province of Cotopaxi, for which the COSO model
   questionnaire was adapted, applied as part of the observation method,
   and finally descriptive statistics were applied for the analysis of the
   data obtained. It was determined that the Control Environment, Control
   Activities and Supervision and Monitoring components have a high level
   of performance, while the Risk Assessment and Information and
   Communication components showed a lower level of compliance in the
   cooperatives studied.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we hypothesize that producer cooperatives are more
   efficient than private firms, even when the impact of the political and
   economic environment is controlled for, and irrespective of the
   orientation with which efficiency is assessed; that is, whether firms
   target the reduction of inputs or the expansion of outputs. The
   empirical application focuses on a longitudinal population of olive oil
   manufacturing firms operating in the south of Spain from 1944 to 1998.
   The analyses clearly show that producer cooperatives are more efficient

Abstract = {Purpose Rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) have long dominated China's
   rural credit market and met most of agricultural credit demands while
   the existing literature seldom examines their contribution to
   agricultural sector. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical
   evidence on the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth, using
   China's provincial panel data from 1997 to 2014.
   Design/methodology/approach Both static fixed effects models and
   two-step generalized method of moment dynamic panel data models, which
   control the endogeneity, are employed to identify the causality from RCC
   credit to agricultural growth in China. Findings The results show that
   the credit from RCCs increases the agricultural output significantly. A
   1 percent increase in RCC credit leads to agricultural growth of about
   0.08 percent, which is robust to various empirical specifications.
   Further study shows that the contribution of RCC credit to agricultural
   growth decreases from the most developed eastern region to the least
   developed western region and increases over time. Research
   limitations/implications The results imply that RCC credit is critical
   in financing agricultural activities by relaxing rural credit
   constraints and intense competition strengthens the contribution of RCCs
   to agricultural growth by improving managerial efficiency and developing
   diversified financial products to meet better rural credit demands.
   Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is first empirical
   study on the effect of RCC credit on agricultural growth despite of many
   on the role of financial development in agricultural growth.},

Abstract = {The financial sector is characterized by a greater pre-sence of men in
   senior management levels. For this reason, this paper aims to determine
   the influence of gender diversity on the financial performance of these
   institutions. This article analyzes a sample of 31 savings and credit
   cooperatives, as well as the 24 private banks in Ecuador. Gender
   diversity was measured with three indicators: the percentage of women,
   the Blau Index and the Shannon Index; the performance va-riable was
   measured with ROA and ROE and the debt ratio; and with a quantitative
   approach they were related through econometric models. The results show
   that cooperatives have greater gender diversity than banks. Gender
   diversity does affect ROA but not ROE or indebtedness. Greater inclusion
   of women in management positions is still required for better diversity.},

Abstract = {Between 1950 and 2010, the British co-operative movement faced a series
   of commercial, structural, and corporate governance crises. Having
   pioneered many of the features of modern large-scale retailing since its
   origins in the mid-nineteenth century, from the 1950s the Co-operative
   Wholesale Society (CWS) and the retail cooperative societies it served
   experienced plummeting market share, continued internecine rivalries,
   and increasing marginalization. In the early twenty-first century,
   however, co-operatives improved their market share and experienced a
   ``Renaissance{''} in commercial fortunes despite continued fierce
   competition in food retailing. As yet there has been little exploration
   of the nature of this turnaround and the ways in which the
   once-foundering cooperative business model was re-engineered.
   Drawing on new research into the CWS (renamed The Co-operative Group in
   2001), this article provides a historical analysis of the movement's
   decline and revival. As the article details, from the 1950s significant
   efforts were made to reform CWS and the movement as a whole. However,
   co-operatives were slow to adapt to the changing business environment,
   hampered by dysfunctional organizational dynamics that constrained
   structural change and limited efforts to compete with private retail
   multiples. Following an unsuccessful takeover bid for CWS in 1997,
   co-operative opinion coalesced around the need for change. In the final
   section, the authors analyze the factors underpinning the
   ``Renaissance,{''} focusing on both organizational innovations and the
   reassertion of core values and principles on which co-operation had been
   built. This provides a fascinating illustration of how a business can
   respond effectively to internal and external challenges, yet retain its
   fundamental character.},

Journal = {FORUM FOR SOCIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {253-261},
Abstract = {The social economy is large and legally embedded in France yet its
   institutions and practices are poorly understood in the English-speaking
   world. The roots of the social economy lie in pre-Marxian socialism, the
   labor movement, and social Catholicism. Marginalized after World War II,
   the theory and practice of social economy made a comeback with the
   second left of the 1970s and 1980s, including a particular emphasis on
   self-management or autogestion. With new legal support for cooperatives
   and growing academic interest in social economy, the future is
   promising. At the same time, the collapse of the Socialist Party and the
   liberal trend of the main union federation supporting social economy are
   worrisome.},

Title = {Producer co-operatives and economic efficiency: Evidence from the
   nineteenth-century cotton textile industry},
Journal = {BUSINESS HISTORY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {54},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {855-882},
Abstract = {The relative efficiency of producer co-operatives is investigated
   through an examination of the financial performance of a group of cotton
   spinning firms that emerged from the spread of co-operative ideals after
   the mid-nineteenth century. Reflecting such influences these firms
   adopted two particularly important aspects of democratic governance: use
   of low denomination partly paid shares to encourage wide share ownership
   among local working class operatives, and the use of a one shareholder
   one vote rule at company meetings. Prior literature, much of which
   predicts the failure of producer co-operatives due to incentive
   problems, has not specifically examined these aspects of democratic
   control. Moreover because the case study utilises samples of stock
   market quoted companies, there is an opportunity to quantify the
   financial performance effects of these governance mechanisms. The case
   study therefore offers a unique insight and important contribution to
   the wider literature. The results show that both aspects of democratic
   governance contributed to the economic success of the companies that
   adopted them, enabling them to satisfy the high demand for cash
   dividends that characterised investor requirements. However, the
   cyclical nature of the cotton industry and the stock market booms and
   slumps that resulted led to redistributions of wealth through time that
   in the long run undermined the co-operative project.},

Title = {Property rights reform and capital adequacy ratios of rural credit
   cooperatives in China{*}},
Journal = {ECONOMIC MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {106},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have focused on bank ownership with a typical focus on
   analyzing performance issues by using data from commercial banks;
   however, these do not consider the link between ownership and capital
   adequacy. Our study fills this gap in the literature by investigating
   the impact of property rights reform on banks' capital adequacy in China
   and heterogeneity across restructured forms of ownership, reform
   pathways, and time. Using data from rural credit cooperatives in China
   for 2008-2014, we find that rural cooperative banks have better capital
   adequacy than banks under two other forms of ownership. We further find
   that among four possible reform pathways, only restructuring from a
   rural cooperative bank to a rural commercial bank enhances capital
   adequacy significantly and that improvements in capital adequacy
   generally weaken over time. Further analyses indicate that this
   improvement is primarily attributable to capital injections and removal
   of non-performing assets by the government. These findings contribute to
   an understanding of how best to reform rural finance, particularly in
   developing countries.},

Abstract = {The system of consumer cooperation has a certain potential in solving
   national problems related to the provision of employment, food security
   and social reorganization of the village. However, the emerging trend of
   losing the competitive positions of the consumer cooperative system in
   the regional consumer markets in Russia leads to the realization of the
   need for institutional changes that would allow full use of the economic
   and social potential of the development of consumer cooperation in the
   conditions of the structural transformation of Russian society. The
   authors offer practical recommendations on the design and formation of
   effective forms of management of economic entities in the cooperative
   sector, as well as the development of a new institutional model of
   innovative development of the system of consumer cooperation adequate to
   the challenges of modern society, capable of restoring the competitive
   positions of its subjects in the regional market. Modeling of
   sustainable innovative development of the regional system of consumer
   cooperation assumes the use of the following system-forming components:
   resources (material, human resources, knowledge, technologies, etc.
   necessary for the production of an innovative product), space
   (territorially differentiated innovation activity of economic systems),
   institutions (set of rules and Mechanisms that stimulate the innovative
   activity of economic systems). It is the personnel resource as the most
   difficultly formalized will be the subject of our consideration. The
   choice of the vector of its strategic transformation should be directed
   in favor of new methods of managing this resource, in order to achieve
   the set goal with nonincreasing material costs. The first stage in the
   implementation of the proposed system may be the formation of a basis
   for designing the vector of economic development, namely, the creation
   of map-bases of the basic regional resources. And, as an example, the
   creation of a single regional base of the labor reserve as a key
   (system-forming) factor. It is the definition of the structure of this
   resource that will give the main impulse for the rational formation of
   this or that production cycle. That, in turn, will solve a number of
   acute social problems in the region.},

   Agricultural Producer Organizations (POs). The main material of the
   study consisted of the original data obtained from the surveys carried
   out with 360 producers determined by the proportional sampling method in
   the province of Usak, Turkey. According to the research findings,
   members/partners found Agricultural Development Cooperatives more
   successful. Agricultural Development Cooperative, respectively, was
   followed by Agricultural Credit Cooperative, Stud Breeders Association,
   Producer Association, Sugar Beet Growers Cooperative, and Chamber of
   Agriculture. Irrigation Cooperative was the least successful producer
   organization. It was determined that the most important problem of the
   POs was the managerial problem, and it was followed by the financial,
   supervision, education, top organization, and legislation problems. The
   study is of primary importance in the success of the organization and in
   the effective use of production resources.},

Abstract = {The authors undertake the first econometric study of efficiency for
   Eroski, the largest member of the Mondragon group of worker
   cooperatives. Three types of stores are found within Eroski: 1)
   cooperatives with significant employee ownership and voice; 2)
   cooperatives with modest employee ownership and limited voice (known as
   GESPAs); and 3) conventional stores with no employee ownership. Key data
   are monthly observations9,800 for supermarkets and 2,150 for
   hypermarkets (large superstores combining supermarkets and department
   stores). By estimating first-difference models, the authors find that
   hypermarket stores with cooperative ownership have significantly faster
   sales growth than do GESPA stores. For supermarkets overall, they find
   no significant differences in performance among the three types of
   stores. For a subgroup of small supermarkets, however, cooperatives
   outperform conventional stores. To investigate the mechanisms that help
   explain why cooperatives perform better, the authors provide additional
   evidence that takes into account the more extensive opportunities for
   employee involvement, training, and stronger economic incentives in
   cooperatives. While cooperative members are better paid than peers in
   comparable firms, individual data show that job satisfaction is lower
   for cooperative workers than for GESPA workers. Though this may reflect
   higher worker expectations in cooperatives, alternatively cooperatives
   may constitute a high-stress work system.},

Abstract = {Increasing institutional capital through deposit mobilization keeps the
   cost of capital low, thus leading to financial sustainability. However,
   little is known about how deposit mobilization affects financial
   sustainability. Using balanced panel data of 166 rural savings and
   credit cooperatives (RUSACCOs) from Ethiopia over the period of
   2014-2016, we investigated the effect of deposit mobilization on
   financial sustainability. The results of the panel regression estimates
   showed that, among the deposits mobilization variables, the deposit to
   loan ratio, deposit to total asset ratio, the volume of deposits, and
   demand deposit ratio had a significant direct impact on financial
   sustainability. The fixed effect regression result for interest rate
   spread showed that an inverse relationship existed between the interest
   rate spread and financial sustainability. Furthermore, according to our
   robust fixed effect regression results, among the control variables, the
   age of the institution and inflation rate affects financial
   sustainability. Contrary to our expectations, the number of members and
   the percentage of woman members were not significant. This may be
   attributed to the fact that some members were inactive for a long
   period. We suggest that RUSACCOs should focus on deposit mobilization
   specifically on demand deposits and keep the interest rate spread
   narrower to ensure their sustainability.},

Abstract = {This study has two related goals - one very specific and one more
   general. The specific goal is to constructively engage with Lodhia
   (2017) on the issue of whether and to what extent `qualitative cousins'
   are well served by Faff's (2015) original pitching research (PR)
   template. Using this `cousins' focus as a primer, the more general goal
   is to update the agenda created by Faff (2015) and in so doing, explore
   the `extended family' of PR work/resources now available.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between complexity behavior and
   enterprise growth in savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) in Uganda.
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the four regions of Uganda,
   using a mixed method approach. Primary data was collected using a
   self-administered questionnaire from 269 SACCOs in Uganda. Zero-order
   correlation, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling
   techniques were used to analyze the data. The study findings indicate a
   positive and significant relationship between complexity behavior and
   enterprise growth in SACCOs in Uganda. Furthermore, the dimensions of
   complexity behavior (self-organizing, adaptive behavior, and networking)
   are found to be positively and significantly correlated with enterprise
   growth in SACCOs in Uganda. This research focuses on the role of
   complexity behavior in promoting enterprise growth in a developing
   economy.},

Abstract = {After the natural disaster caused the collapse of peasants' houses, the
   peasants need to repair or rebuild their houses, but they do not have
   enough funds to do that. In this kind of situation, the government
   should give some support to help peasants accomplish the work, and we
   call the funds that government gives to peasants the disaster relief
   fund. This paper takes relief fund distribution in Hua Man County
   Shaanxi Province in northwestern China as an example to demonstrate an
   effective way to choose and optimize the measures for allocating relief
   fund under principle of the least cost and most efficiency. The author
   proposes a direct implementing solution, emphasizing on the introductory
   of rural credit cooperative system and some financial enterprises to
   participate reconstruction after disaster, thus the efforts will benefit
   the government from functioning of supervision and management, upgrading
   the efficiency of fund allocating as well as reducing segments for the
   loss of the fund.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {138},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Using supervisory data, we test the tax effects on the liability
   structure (the composition of deposits and other forms of debt) of the
   credit cooperative banks (BCC) by exploiting exogenous variations in the
   rates of tax on productive activities (IRAP) across Italian regions and
   over time. The testable predictions are derived from a model of bank
   liability structure that incorporates regulatory closure, endogenous
   default, and deposit insurance. We show that banks endogenously respond
   to tax cuts mainly by reducing non-deposit debt ratios, instead of
   deposit ratios, when lowering leverage. The overall liability structure
   adjustment substantially reduces non-equity funding costs.},

Abstract = {Greater use of household solar-panel systems has the potential to
   improve energy access and affordability while reducing the risk of
   climate change. This article uses a survey of 6,000 households in Nepal,
   a developing economy, to enhance understanding of the factors driving
   solar-system uptake by households. A key contribution is the breadth of
   analysis. We find important influences for economic, social, and
   locational factors. In contrast, physical dwelling aspects, such as roof
   material, appear to be less important. Social influences explain extra
   variation in solar-panel uptake, when comparing social and economic
   influences, although some variables could be classified in multiple
   categories. For example, membership in a women's saving and credit
   cooperative is a socioeconomic factor that is associated with greater
   solar-panel adoption. Socioeconomic factors may be the most important
   for future policy innovations, given that existing policy already
   focuses on location. For instance, this article finds that solar
   adoption has been much higher in the most supported regions for the
   Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy.},

Abstract = {Shareholder-owned corporations were dominant for much of the 20th
   century in the United States, yet their numbers are substantially
   declining in the 21st. This article argues that we are observing a
   regime shift in the transaction costs of organizing that disfavors
   traditional corporations. Accompanying this shift is the emergence of
   low-cost, small-scale production technologies that will allow locally
   based universal fabrication facilities. In combination, these changes
   are compatible with new forms of non-corporate enterprise. While
   corporations are basic units of production in many theories about the
   economy, they should be regarded as only one hypothesis about how
   production is and can be organized. Traditional alternatives to the
   corporation include producer and consumer cooperatives (e.g., Land o'
   Lakes, REI) and mutuals (e.g., State Farm, Vanguard). More recent
   possibilities include commons-based peer production (such as Linux and
   Wikipedia) and ``platforms{''} that connect buyers and sellers (such as
   Uber and Airbnb). The raw materials are available for more democratic
   and locally oriented enterprise. Management scholarship has an
   opportunity to document and encourage this movement.},

Abstract = {The paper documents the post-war retrenchment and failure of the
   post-war British Consumer Co-operative Movement. In contrast to the
   general failure one CEO, Terry Thomas stands out both for his success in
   co-operative rebranding and returning to profitability the UK
   Co-operative Bank and because he alone amongst the top echelons of the
   Co-operative Groups Management based his strategies on a clearly
   articulated philosophy based on his understanding of the values and
   purpose of the co-operative movement rooted in its historical traditions
   grounded in the writings and achievements of Robert Owen, The paper goes
   on to provide a case study of the bank's process of transformation from
   loss-making subsidiary to the first positive co-operative national brand
   in the post-war period of its history. The author argues that lack of
   appropriate vision based on the founding values and purposes of the
   Co-operative Movement is the principal reason for the management's and
   governance failures that have beset the UK Co-operative Group. Instead
   of using the past to help in understanding the present and planning for
   the future, the UK Co-operative Group Leadership ignored it or worse
   used the past successes to congratulate itself and disguise its manifest
   failures. In this, they were supported by an uncritical Co-operative
   Union (later renamed Co-operatives UK). Davis argues large co-operatives
   cannot be managed by a civil service responsible to an elected board.
   Co-operatives need a servant-leadership model of professional management
   dedicated to the transformational goals set by the founders of the
   co-operative movement. This needs a radical rethink and promotion of
   co-operative management education and a dedicated executive recruitment
   that seeks out value-based professionals whose attitudes and values are
   compatible with Co-operative values, ownership and purpose.},

Abstract = {The nineteenth century saw the standardization and rapid spread of the
   modern business corporation around the world. Yet those early
   corporations differed from their contemporary counterparts in important
   ways. Most obviously, they commonly deviated from the one-share-one-vote
   rule that is customary today, instead adopting restricted voting schemes
   that favored small over large shareholders. In recent years, both legal
   scholars and economists have sought to explain these schemes as a rough
   form of investor protection, shielding small shareholders from
   exploitation by controlling shareholders in an era when investor
   protection law was weak.
   We argue, in contrast, that restricted voting rules generally served not
   to protect shareholders as investors, but to protect them as consumers.
   The firms adopting such rules were frequently local monopolies that
   provided vital infrastructural services such as transportation, banking,
   and insurance. The local merchants, farmers, and landholders who used
   these services were the firms' principal shareholders. They commonly
   purchased shares not in the expectation of profit, but to finance
   collective goods. Restricted shareholder voting assured that control of
   the firms' services would not fall into the hands of monopolists or
   competitors. In effect, the corporations had much the character of
   consumer cooperatives. This perspective also sheds light on the unusual
   importance given to the doctrine of ultra vires in the nineteenth
   century.
   While current legal and economic scholarship has focused incessantly on
   the separation between ownership and control, the prior separation
   between ownership and consumption, accomplished by the late nineteenth
   century, was another fundamental but generally overlooked turning point
   in the history of the business corporation. Understanding this
   transformation throws light not just on historical practices, but also
   on contemporary debates over deviations from the rule of
   one-share-one-vote.},

Abstract = {The system of consumer cooperation has a certain potential in solving
   national problems related to the provision of employment and the quality
   of life of the population, as well as to the social reorganization of
   the village. The study shows that the cooperative system is
   characterized by the complementarity of traits (social and economic),
   the dialectical interaction of which serves as the basis for the
   formation of civil society (self-organization and voluntary cooperation
   of shareholders in the process of production and economic activity) and
   a peculiar locomotive of the evolution of society towards building
   socially-oriented market economy (non-commercial nature of activities
   and humanistic values). However, the emerging trend of losing the
   competitive positions of the consumer cooperative system in the regional
   consumer markets in Russia leads to an awareness of the need for
   institutional changes that would make it possible to fully utilize the
   economic and social potential of the development of consumer cooperation
   in the context of the structural transformation of Russian society. The
   authors offer practical recommendations on the design and formation of
   effective forms of management of economic entities in the cooperative
   sector. Complex nature of the economic resource requires its inclusion
   in the correlation algorithm of proactive management. Simulation of
   sustainable innovation development of the regional system of consumer
   cooperation is possible only using optimization-qualimetric modeling on
   the platform of the software product. Computer technologies create
   objective opportunities for creating the required model. The integrated
   computer space is able to rework the network of mathematical matrices,
   building a complete life cycle of an economic resource, consisting not
   only of collecting and analyzing information, but also the possibility
   of making operational management decisions.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of conditions and factors of
   labor productivity growth. As an example, agro-industrial enterprises of
   Kemerovo region were taken. Research strategy is directed to the
   analysis of qualitative and quantitative information on the condition of
   an object, the use of such empiric methods as statistic data analyses,
   unstructured interviews with executives, and employee questionnaires. In
   2017, the Federal Program was adopted, in order to increase labor
   productivity and contribute to employment. To implement the Program,
   representatives of enterprises of all fields and all business entities
   must participate actively. The results of an expert interview
   demonstrate that executives are very concerned with the problem of low
   labor productivity in the whole country, in Kemerovo region, in their
   own enterprises, and can see the ways of its solution, but they are not
   included properly in corresponding managing aspects. On the average, in
   the agro-industrial sector the labor productivity increase goes on
   faster than in other industrial fields of our country, but in terms of
   value it is low. When workers of a Kuzbass enterprise containing of two
   agricultural consumer cooperatives for the production of dairy products
   were questioned, it was revealed that there were the following problems:
   bad condition of equipment and mechanisms, uncomfortable work and rest
   schedule, unsatisfactory working tension and rhythm, ineffective system
   of work stimulation, insufficient social support for workers, and
   others. So, the factors of labor productivity growth lay in the economic
   and logistical areas as well as organizational and social ones. (c) 2019

Abstract = {The sector of cooperative banks is quite diversified in terms of the
   scope of activity, kinds of banking services or approach to the
   realization of cooperative principles. Moreover, some of the banks may
   focus their activity on farmers who traditionally use local financial
   institutions. The model of the cooperative bank's functioning including
   the concentration of activity on specific services, groups of clients or
   local community's needs is most of all dependent on the management's
   decision. Due to relationship problems of agencies in cooperatives what
   determines most the functioning of credit cooperatives are the
   management's objectives.
   The aim of this paper is to provide a diagnosis of cooperative banks'
   business models and to examine the features of the models and its
   conditions as exemplified by a selected group of 75 cooperative banks in
   Poland. A substantial number of Polish cooperative banks do not offset
   their raised deposits and granted loans. Those banks as net lenders for
   other participants of the financial market do not follow a cooperative
   principle: local money for local needs.},

Abstract = {The Mexican coffee crisis that began with the liberalization of the
   international coffee market in 1989 led to the reorganization of the
   coffee sector under the control of transnational companies after state
   regulation has been replaced by policies aimed at allowing the survival
   of the small producers but not reactivating the sector. The resistance
   of the powerful roaster industry, dominated by the giant Nestle, has
   made it impossible to improve the quality of the coffee sold on the
   domestic market, and its importation of cheap robusta coffee for use in
   instant preparations has further reduced prices. The survival of the
   producer cooperatives depends on their capacity to enter the market
   through niches such as the organic and Fair Trade, where they receive a
   better price for their products. For the others, the only solution is to
   migrate to the North.},

Abstract = {This research attempts to explore the process of change and to examine
   in more depth the nature of the changes in management control which
   accompany the adoption of the new information technologies within small
   and medium enterprises. In particular, recognizing that management
   control change is a continuous organizational process (rather than an
   outcome), the trajectory of which is shaped by an incessant inter-play
   of several influences, this research intends to explore the way in which
   the implementation of a new integrated information system contributes to
   this process. To address this issue, the current research combines
   theoretical and empirical insights. After having reviewed the literature
   on the main topics and produced a theoretical understanding to
   illuminate the nature of the aforementioned changes, the research relies
   upon an illustrative case study concerning a medium-size cooperative
   society based in Italy. Recognising the complexity of organizational
   life, the field study does not aspire to isolate and define how and by
   how much ICT has been a driver of the management control change, but
   rather to explore the whole process of change in order to appreciate the
   diversity of interrelated influences which have shaped its trajectory
   and how these influences interacted with each-other. Among this
   inter-play of influences, the study aims then to investigate the
   particular role played by the two-way relationship between ICT and
   management control. The implementation of the new integrated information
   system has opened up several opportunities for the business management
   and in particular for the management control. However, so far, only part
   of these opportunities have been exploited. Furthermore, while it could
   be acknowledged that the new system facilitated the changes in
   management control both in its material and immaterial dimensions, it
   could not be concluded that they were the result of the implementation
   of the new system. Many other factors have interacted within the process
   of management control change. For example, of paramount importance has
   been the controller's determination to enact the change. The case study
   analyzes these factors and the way in which they have jointly
   facilitated and/or hindered the management control change.},

   about 700 farmers. Producer groups are given hygiene, drying and

Abstract = {Most work on profit sharing has been empirical, and in a rare consensus,
   almost all studies have found a positive relationship between profit
   sharing and productivity. Theoretical foundations have been neglected in
   this work, and no attempt has been made to relate these empirical
   findings to extensive evidence for rent-sharing, or wage differentials
   related to profits that are hard to explain on the basis of unobserved
   individual characteristics. Here we argue that explicit and implicit
   forms of profit sharing should be viewed as two sides of the same coin,
   and can both be given convincing theoretical foundations. Relevant
   models include the importance of fairness and equitable pay and repeated
   games with mutual monitoring by profit or rent-sharing workers. Most
   empirical work has neglected the selection problem, or the existence of
   favourable but unobserved preconditions for profit sharing, and so
   probably exaggerates productivity gains from profit sharing in isolation
   and benefits from tax incentives. Cross-sectional regressions have also
   failed to uncover specific channels of influence of profit sharing.},

Title = {Impact of regulatory reforms on compliance with mandatory disclosures by
   savings and credit co-operatives in Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {246-270},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to utilize institutional theory to examine the
   impact of the 2008-2010 regulatory reforms on compliance with mandatory
   disclosures by savings and credit co-operatives (SACCOs) in Kenya.
   Design/methodology/approach Two-stage least squares panel regression
   approach is utilized to analyse data covering 1,272 firm-year
   observations for 212 SACCOs over a six-year period, 2008-2013. An
   analysis of the pre- and post-regulation impacts on compliance with
   mandatory disclosure requirements is also performed.
   Findings The results, which are in support of the institutional theory,
   reveal that licensed SACCOs engage in higher compliance with mandatory
   disclosures, and this improves from the pre- to the post-regulation
   period. The results show that SACCOs under inquiry engage in lower
   compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements, especially in the
   post-regulation period. The findings also reveal a significant and
   positive association between SACCO size, co-operative governance and
   compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements.
   Research limitations/implications The study focuses on transition-level
   SACCOs in a single country. An extension into other jurisdictions with
   nascent, transitional and mature SACCOs would provide greater insights
   into the impact of disclosure regulation. Further, the study uses a
   self-constructed disclosure checklist which is subject to coding errors
   and biases.
   Practical implications The findings highlight the need for SACCO
   regulators and accounting professional body to devise incentives to
   improve the level of compliance with required disclosures.
   Originality/value The study contributes to the dearth of evidence on the
   efficacy of the introduction of mandatory disclosure requirements in a
   developing country where compliance is problematic because of
   difficulties with enforcement.},

   intellectual faculties, and competition of city commercial banks is no
   exception. However, they retain the stereotype of the past credit

   their work status in city commercial banks, and problems occurred in

Abstract = {The government in British-ruled India established cooperative banks to
   compete with private moneylenders in the rural credit market. State
   officials expected greater competition to increase the supply of
   low-cost credit, thereby expanding investment potential for the rural
   poor. Cooperatives did increase credit supply but captured a small share
   of the credit market and reported net losses throughout the late
   colonial and early postcolonial period. The article asks why this
   experiment did not succeed and offers two explanations. First, low
   savings restricted the role of social capital and mutual supervision as
   methods of financial regulation in the cooperative sector. Second, a
   political-economic ideology that privileged equity over efficiency made
   for weak administrative regulation.},

Abstract = {This study demonstrates the emergence, subsequent diffusion, and early
   demise of Ottoman agricultural credit cooperatives, called Memleket
   Sandiks (OMSs), as they represent unique hybrid forms that blend state,
   community, and market logics in a single organizational configuration.
   The study narrates how changes in the Ottoman Empire's institutional
   order during the Tanzimat era enabled conditions that led to the
   emergence of OMSs. Subsequently, the practices of the form transformed,
   especially after the Russian-Ottoman War, concomitant with further
   changes in Ottoman society's institutional order. Although OMSs
   initially enjoyed legitimacy granted by the Ottoman State, the shift
   towards dominating state logic in the Hamidian era led to the erosion of
   practices animated by market and community logics. The form was
   discontinued as the increasingly autocratic state levied taxes and
   preyed upon the accumulated surplus, which disabled agglomerative
   capacity of sandiks and diminished the solidarity among cooperative
   members.},

Abstract = {In this study we explain the concepts, determinants and imperatives of
   boundary in smallholder producers' cooperatives both conceptually and
   empirically. The conceptual framework indicates the importance of the
   type of goods (being a club good or not) and range of activities that a
   cooperative provides to its members in defining a competitive boundary.
   Using unique organisational and market level data from Ethiopia, we then
   test empirically whether the observed (weak) performance of producers'
   cooperatives in Africa is explained by their organisational boundary -
   the type and range of goods or services they provide to members. The
   empirical results confirm that the competitiveness of producers'
   cooperatives is significantly correlated with the type and number of
   services - i.e. cooperatives that provide club goods and a limited range
   of services are found to be more competitive. The results also suggest
   that a considerable number of cooperatives in Ethiopia engage in markets
   where they do not have competitive advantage. Overall, we demonstrate
   the importance of properly defining a viable boundary - proper selection
   of services (or markets) and limiting the range of services - for
   improving the competitiveness of membership-based producer cooperatives
   in Africa.},

Title = {Financial repression in China's agricultural economy},
Journal = {CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {260-274},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether or not
   financial repression exists in the saving and investment activities of
   farm households in rural areas of China.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically investigates
   repression in rural China using the McKinnon-Shaw model and
   microeconomic data combined with lending and savings rates and ceilings
   by rural credit cooperatives.
   Findings - The paper finds only limited evidence of a repression
   dominated by savings, while investment response appears to be, at least
   on average, normal or unrepressed. More specifically, the paper finds
   that the relationship between growth and investment is consistent with
   an unrepressed economy but savings do show evidence of repression.
   Originality/value - The political focus of economic reformation in China
   has been one of rapid economic growth in urban areas and a neglect of
   the agriculture sector. This focus on urban growth has led some Chinese
   scholars to speculate that the residual impact is a repressed
   agricultural and rural economy, at least in the context of McKinnon and

Abstract = {This article shows that in the years between 1937 and 1962 Aldous Huxley
   adopted a species of anarchism. It demonstrates, first, how in espousing
   gradualism and pacifism, in stressing the significance of education and
   meditation as agents of social change, in seeking to construct
   intentional communities in the here and now, as well as build on
   pre-existing examples of `anarchy in action' such as consumer and
   producer cooperatives, in taking a measured view of the state, not
   rejecting the institution on principle, but only its coercive form, and
   in making sex central to his vision of utopia as an essential ingredient
   of a happy and sustainable life, Huxley anticipated the `new' anarchism
   of the postwar era. Second, it argues that, in rejecting notions of
   `normal' subjectivity, in seeing the human subject as fundamentally
   irrational, in viewing power as coextensive with society itself, as a
   relationship that can only be managed as opposed to abolished, in
   repudiating grand theory or metanarratives in favour of
   `micro-politics', and in viewing science as both epistemologically
   flawed and potentially oppressive, Huxley anticipated postanarchism.
   Despite his reluctance to adopt a label, it is the contention of this
   article that Huxley ought to be considered a social anarchist.},

Abstract = {Social economy nowadays embraces a great plurality of actors, i.e.
   cooperatives, social enterprises, credit cooperatives, mutual insurance
   companies, insurance cooperatives, various NGOs, addressed to solving
   developmental, social, cultural, educational, environmental and other
   challenges the contemporary society is faced with. The paper reflects on
   the role of cooperatives in addressing those challenges. Cooperatives,
   as people-centred enterprises owned, controlled and managed by and for
   their members, have significant impacts on redirecting economic
   processes, solving social challenges, improving the quality of life in
   the local community and environmental protection in many countries all
   over the world. The purpose of the paper is to analyse the state, trends
   and challenges regarding development of cooperatives, in the context of
   social economy, in Croatia. The research was realised in two phases
   during 2018, using on-line questionnaires as main research instruments.
   The first phase was related to specific characteristics of cooperatives
   operating in Croatia and challenges they are faced with while the second
   part was related to students' perceptions and attitudes regarding
   cooperatives as business models. This paper presents the result of the
   first research phase. The research has revealed various internal and
   external barriers which hinder further development of cooperatives in
   Croatia. The research results contribute to deeper understating of
   challenges and barriers cooperative are face with in Croatia.},

Abstract = {Sustainable forest management is the key to biodiversity conservation,
   flow of resources and climate change mitigation. We assessed the impact
   of various forest management regimes (FMRs): legal felling series
   {[}(reserve forest (RF), demarcated protected forest (DPF),
   un-demarcated protected forest (UPF), co-operative society forest (CSF)
   and un-classed forest (UF)] on biodiversity conservations and carbon
   storage in Acacia catechu Willd. Dominated northern tropical dry
   deciduous forest ecosystems in Nurpur Forest Division of north-western
   Himalaya, India. The study revealed significant variations in floristic
   composition, biodiversity indices, population structure and C storage
   potential among different forest management regimes. The RF and DPF were
   found to be rich in species diversity and richness whereas the Simpson
   dominance index for trees and shrubs was maximum in UF and UPF,
   respectively. The diversity of understory herbs were higher in CSF and
   UF. The maximum density of seedlings, saplings and poles were recorded
   in RF followed by DPF and UPF, whereas the minimum density was found in
   CSF. The tree C density (69.15 Mg C ha(-1)) was maximum in UF closely
   followed by RF; whereas the minimum was recorded in CSF (33.27 Mg C
   ha(-1)). The soil C density was maximum in RF (115.49 Mg C ha(-1)) and
   minimum in CSF (90.28 Mg C ha(-1)). Similarly, the maximum total
   ecosystem C density was recorded in RF (183.52 Mg C ha(-1)) followed by
   DPF (166.61 Mg C ha(-1)) and minimum in CSF (126.05 Mg C ha(-1)).
   Overall, UF management regimes were shown to have a greater capacity for
   C storage in vegetation, whereas strict FMRs, such as RF and DPF, were
   found to be more diverse and have a higher soil and ecosystem carbon
   density. The study established that in the midst of climate and
   biodiversity emergencies, it is urgent to maintain, protect and
   strengthen the network of RF and DPF FMRs for biodiversity conservation,
   climate change adaptation and mitigation.},

Abstract = {The starting point for this paper is the finding that references to a
   system of self-managed firms as the future social order are quite
   exceptional in the published literature on Marxist thought. Despite ever
   more marked deviations of leftist political platforms from the
   centralised model of the URSS, it is clear that self-management has not
   taken the place of central planning in Marxist plans for the future. In
   contrast, the author will come up with evidence that an analysis of the
   self-managed firm system may offer clues for a critical discussion of
   major points of Marxian theory, including the labour theory of value,
   alienation, dialectics or the subjectobject inversion in capitalism.
   Accordingly, in the individual sections of this paper each of these
   central aspects of Marxian theory will be separately addressed in the
   light of insights flowing from the economic theory of producer
   cooperatives.},

Abstract = {The implementation of corporate social responsibility policies in firm
   management processes is becoming increasingly relevant. In the
   particular case of the financial sector, the incorporation of these
   policies often has huge repercussions as their role as intermediaries
   means that firms depend on them for investment which, in turn, affects
   the way firms perform. Within the financial sector, those organizations
   form part of the social economy-credit cooperatives and savings
   banks-are a very particular case as one of the principles on which they
   are based is their social nature. In this study, we examine the social
   responsibility situation in these financial organizations, focusing on
   the case of savings banks. We provide information that will help us
   better understand the real state of Spanish savings banks with respect
   to these two areas of social responsibility: The ``Obra Social{''} (or
   charitable activities) and the incorporation of social and environmental
   criteria in their business policies.},

Abstract = {The Mondragon producers cooperatives in Basque Spain represent the
   classic case of alternative industrial organisation. While the
   cooperatives received a great deal of scholarly attention during the
   1970s and 1980s, relative little has been published on recent
   developments at Mondragon. It is time to update the Mondragon story. In
   1991, 100 cooperatives joined to become the Mondragon Cooperative
   Corporation. This super-structure has permitted an important degree of
   centralised control over member cooperatives. Yet it has also been the
   source of substantial challenges, both structural and ideological, to
   this alternative form of industrial organisation. We appear to be
   witnessing the cooperatives' decline, the end of a great experiment in
   favour of just another capitalist enterprise. This story is important
   both for cooperativism in Mondragon itself and for scholars and
   practitioners worldwide who find in Mondragon proof than an alternative,
   less exploitative approach to industrial organisation is possible.},

Abstract = {Institutions that rely on joint liability to facilitate lending to the
   poor have a long history and are now a common feature of many developing
   countries. Economists have proposed several theories of joint-liability
   lending that stress various aspects of its informational and enforcement
   advantages over other forms of lending. This paper analyzes how
   joint-liability lending promotes screening, monitoring, state
   verification and enforcement of repayment. An empirical section draws on
   case studies to highlight how joint liability works in practice. (C)

Abstract = {This paper outlines the institutional prerequisites needed to achieve a
   commercially sustainable rural financial services industry in China. It
   presents a vision for a future rural financial services industry built
   around a core of commercially-oriented financial institutions operated
   with sound corporate governance structures and the autonomy to develop
   and price products appropriate to target clientele. Complementary
   services such as credit information registries, credit guarantee
   schemes, and collateral registries, when suitably arranged according to
   best practice principles, would reduce transaction costs and information
   asymmetries in the market. Improved prudential regulations and
   supervision capacity would promote overall banking sector soundness. The
   paper evaluates the actions needed to achieve such a vision,
   highlighting issues facing rural credit co-operatives (RCCs),
   state-owned commercial banks, and the potential role of development
   banks as well as current initiatives in creating complementary service
   providers. It outlines the capacity building efforts financial
   institutions will need to undertake and the reorientation of bank
   supervision functions that will need to occur. Finally, the paper
   advocates for the comprehensive implementation of a pilot project in
   commercially sustainable rural finance of sufficient scale to provide
   broadly applicable lessons, and provides details of the proposed pilot.},

Abstract = {The improvement of supply chain services' operations in the agrifood
   sector is critical, signifying many reasons for further investigation in
   both vertical and horizontal level, including producers, cooperative
   unions, cooperatives, street markets, retail markets, wholesalers, super
   markets and end consumers. Retail consolidation, technological change in
   production and marketing, and growing consumer demand for produce, have
   altered the traditional market relationships between producers,
   wholesalers, and retailers. Against these changing supply and demand
   relations, fresh produce suppliers are being asked to provide additional
   services and incentives in exchange for volume purchases and other
   commitments by buyers. The demand for such fees and services coincides
   with new modes of retailer operation. Necessary processes such as
   washing, sorting, packing and distributing products, provided either by
   third party logistics provider or by producers owning relevant
   facilities at their premises. Product quality followed by food safety
   and traceability consist drivers for competition that, could secure
   repeat purchasing. Moreover, the usage of packaging materials along with
   their reverse disposal plays an important role saving both environmental
   and economic resources, as waste reduction has become a prime concern in
   industrialized countries. In view of depleted landfill and incineration
   capacities, efforts are made to re-integrate used products into
   industrial production processes for further use.},

Abstract = {This paper views Islamist radicals as self-interested political
   revolutionaries and builds on a general model of political extremism
   developed in a previous paper (Ferrero, 2002). Extremism is modelled as
   a production factor whose effect on expected revenue is initially
   positive and then turns negative, and whose level is optimally chosen by
   a revolutionary organization. The organization is bound by a free-access
   constraint and hence uses the degree of extremism as a means of
   indirectly controlling its level of membership with the aim of
   maximizing expected per capita income of its members, like a producer
   co-operative. The gist of the argument is that radicalization may be an
   optimal reaction to perceived failure (a widespread perception in the
   Muslim world) when political activists are, at the margin, relatively
   strongly averse to effort but not so averse to extremism. This
   configuration is at odds with secular, Western-style revolutionary
   politics but seems to capture well the essence of Islamic revolutionary
   politics, embedded as it is in a doctrinal framework.},

Abstract = {This research aims to analyze the perception of employees of public and
   private financial institutions on strategic remuneration. The
   methodology used in the study is classified, as far as the objectives,
   descriptive, regarding the procedures, survey or survey and as to the
   approach of the problem, quantitative. The data were collected through
   the application of a questionnaire in the period from May to July 2017
   with employees of bank branches and credit cooperatives in the city of
   Cascavel, totaling 154 respondents. Data analysis was performed through
   multivariate analysis such as Factorial Analysis and Cronbach's Alpha.
   The results showed that the perception of employees of public
   institutions is explained in 69.08\%, and the component that most
   explains this perception consists of Status. Regarding the employees'
   perception of private institutions, it was explained in 62.63\%, and the
   main component refers to the Psychological and Social Incentives. It is
   concluded that direct remuneration, despite being a component that
   explains the remuneration of employees of both institutions, was not
   listed as the most explanatory.},

Title = {The mitigating role of regulation on the concentric patterns of
   broadband diffusion. The case of Finland},
Journal = {TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the role of Finnish regulation in achieving the
   broadband penetration goals defined by the National Regulatory
   Authority. It is well known that in the absence of regulatory mitigation
   the population density has a positive effect on broadband diffusion.
   Hence, we measure the effect of the population density on the
   determinants of broadband diffusion throughout the postal codes of
   Finland via Geographically Weighted Regression. We suggest that the main
   determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density follow a
   spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong
   strength or non-concentric convex/concave. Based on 10 patterns, we
   argue that the Finnish spectrum policy encouraged Mobile Network
   Operators to satisfy ambitious Universal Service Obligations without the
   need for a Universal Service Fund. Spectrum auctions facilitated
   infrastructure-based competition via equitable spectrum allocation and
   coverage obligation delivery via low-fee licenses. However, state
   subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract investment from
   nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies
   encouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber
   consumer cooperatives. To explain this emergence, we show that when
   population density decreases, the level of mobile service quality
   decreases and community commitment increases. Hence, we recommend
   regulators implementing market-driven strategies for 5G to stimulate
   local investment. For example, by allocating the 3.5 GHz and higher
   bands partly through local light licensing.},

Abstract = {The existing status of SBS-Agro is complex because it is faced with the
   problem of low farm profitability and indebtedness. Agroprombank, which
   was privatised in 1996, inherited many of the old problems of the Soviet
   system of credit allocation and repayment. The State has tried several
   approaches to provide credit to the agricultural sector since the
   beginning of the reforms. These include centralised subsidised credits,
   commodity credits and credits from the Special Fund of Subsidised
   Credit. However, all have more or less failed; the rate of repayment was
   very poor and most of the budgeted resources were dissipated by
   ineffective borrowers. Local administrations contributed to the low
   financial discipline. An agricultural finance and credit infrastructure
   could be created by the mutual efforts of the State and private capital.
   Credit co-operatives could be the effective tool.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {269-303},

Abstract = {Co-operatives, NGOs and community groups are being increasingly used as
   development agencies by policy-makers, because they are thought to
   provide more accountable, effective and equitable services in many areas
   than public or private agencies. This article attempts to consider some
   of the theoretical and practical implications of this growing role by
   treating them as `value-driven' organizations, and asking how this
   differentiates them, in terms of efficiency and accountability, from
   public or private agencies. It notes the lack of developed theoretical
   models capable of dealing with this question, and examines the relevance
   of existing theories (neo-classical economics, public administration and
   especially varieties of organization theory including the New
   Institutional Economics) in dealing with agencies which claim to be
   dominated by motivations based on democracy and altruism rather than
   self-interest. The author looks at problems associated with the
   measurement of efficiency and enforcement of accountability in
   organizational life and at the need for effective incentives and
   sanctions which provide a stable basis for maintaining commitment. He
   then considers the issues involved in the enforcement of accountability
   to ensure the efficient use of resources in producer co-operatives on
   the one hand and service delivery NGOs on the other. In the former, the
   focus is on the strengths and weaknesses of market competition and the
   costs of collective management; in the latter on the varied
   relationships between `principals and agents' involved in the production
   and management of services.},

   important products of rural financial system reform. Since the
   establishment of system reform, significant achievements have been made.
   Great contributions have been made to rural economic development in
   China. Nowadays, original strategy of rural commercial banks cannot
   adapt fierce competitions of banking development. So, strategy
   transformation and upgrade have become great realistic problems faced by
   rural commercial banks. How to adjust and upgrade management strategy
   has become a focus. This paper proceeds from the reality, discusses
   strategy transformation path of rural commercial banks and related
   problems on the basis of relevant literatures and puts forward

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the size of the borrower group in group lending.
   We show that, when social ties in a community enhance borrowers'
   incentives to exert effort, a profit-maximizing financier chooses a
   group of limited size. Borrowers that would be fundable under moral
   hazard but have insufficient social ties do not receive funding. The
   result arises because there is a trade-off between raising profits
   through increased group size and providing incentives for borrowers with
   less social ties. The result may explain why many micro-lending
   institutions and rural credit cooperatives lend to groups of small size.

   behavior. We show how this contractual structure reduces the incidence
   of equilibrium credit rationing, even assuming a cost disadvantage
   relative to a firm where these roles are specialized. Our model provides
   an explanation for producer and worker buyouts in the face of exit by
   investor owners, and, more generally, for cooperative entry in
   low-return economic environments not serviced by investor-financed
   firms. Further, our model predicts that a cooperative firm is less prone
   to monitor-manager collusion, and that it monitors excessively in
   high-return environments.},

Abstract = {Poor water quality is one of the key environmental problems associated
   with shrimp and pangasius aquaculture in Vietnam. Several studies exist
   on the causes and effects of poor water quality, and on possible
   solutions for effluent control in these two economically important
   production systems. However, only a small number of Vietnamese farms
   apply these reduction options, raising questions over the state-enforced
   compliance with legislated water-quality measures. Voluntary standards
   and certification networks have recently emerged as alternative forms of
   water-quality governance in Vietnamese aquaculture. This paper examines
   a number of ongoing and interlinked international, national and
   community level initiatives on (voluntary) standards and certification
   that aim to promote sustainable shrimp and pangasius aquaculture in
   Vietnam. The results indicate the potential, but also challenges, in the
   development and implementation of national and international standards
   and demonstrate the need for more attention to the role of local
   institutions like producer co-operatives in multi-level governance
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {Non-profit organizations (NPOs), such as financial cooperatives, have a
   longstanding tradition in advanced market economies. We develop a model
   of `mixed credit markets' where pure for-profit institutions (e.g.
   commercial banks) can coexist with financial NPOs which feature a
   concern for inter-member surplus redistribution (e.g. credit
   cooperatives) and enjoy privileged borrower-specific information
   vis-a-vis their for-profit peers, while facing higher funding costs. We
   formally investigate market competition between the two alternative
   financial organizations both offering contracts whose terms entail cross
   subsidization. We argue that heterogeneity in organizational models can
   explain stable coexistence under competitive conditions, and also help
   us interpret the variety of market outcomes - in terms of e.g. overall
   coverage and market shares - as documented in modern financial systems.
   Importantly, the viability of redistribution-oriented NPOs is shown not
   to rest on under-investment issues or concerns about market power, for
   they can successfully operate in markets where credit rationing never
   arises.},

Abstract = {New agricultural practices, including integrated crop-livestock and/or
   forestry systems (IS) can reduce greenhouse emissions without
   compromising food production. Yet adoption rates in many places are low.
   We investigated the factors affecting the probability of Brazilian
   farmers adopting an IS. Using data from 3150 farmers across all 26
   Brazilian states, we tested the importance of four groups of variables
   in affecting adoption: farmer characteristics (age and education); farm
   characteristics (size and feedlot infrastructure); information networks
   (social networks and extension); and market incentives (export share and
   environmental risk). A logistic regression model found all eight
   variables to be statistically significant predictors of IS adoption. The
   two information network variables had the greatest impacts on IS
   adoption. This result demonstrates a central role for public agencies
   like EMBRAPA in developing and communicating new agricultural practices,
   as well as the role of producer cooperatives and associations in making
   information about IS technologies available to farmers.},

Abstract = {The study rationale is in the fact that the digitalization of the
   economy requires new approaches to organizing information services for
   the most vulnerable collective users in the field of agricultural
   production. The purpose of the study is to consider the process of
   selecting an information resource to meet the information needs of
   representatives of small agribusiness. The leading methods of the study
   are an abstract-logical method, the ``5W + 1H{''} formula set, as well
   as information theories, probabilities, and statistical methods. The
   paper proposes a multi-criteria model for selecting an information
   resource to meet the information needs of the representatives of small
   agribusiness within the framework of a specific request, depending on
   the characteristics of the formula ``5W + 1H.{''} The processes of
   assessing particular criterial functions and compiling the objective
   function of the model are also considered. The use of a multicriterial
   selection model is demonstrated on the example of the informational need
   of an agricultural agrotechnical consumer cooperative for updating the
   material and technical resources. The significance of the research topic
   is determined by the fact that in most cases for small agribusiness,
   information is the only resource (capital) at the initial stage of
   operation. More than that, the search process is hampered by the lack of
   the necessary level of qualification and information culture. The
   multi-criteria model of selecting an information resource can find its
   application both in scientific research of information needs and in
   modeling and development of information technologies for agribusiness.},

Abstract = {Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote
   cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and
   collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce
   individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision.
   Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed
   with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline
   defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However,
   extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in
   complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for
   instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the
   police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and
   legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the
   public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single
   monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the
   monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we
   conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers
   from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the
   effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal
   effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to
   the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our
   essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by
   introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies,
   cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection
   and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain
   actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Under favorable conditions, credit can improve the quality of life by
   financing essential assets and services, such as housing and education,
   also by fostering entrepreneurship. Although finance inclusion can widen
   social and economic opportunities, the successful usage of microcredit
   depends on the costs (rates of interests) and on the methodology applied
   to grant credit. Hence, through a bibliographic review, the paper
   presents a comparative analysis of three remarkable experiences on
   microfinance. Firstly, the Brazilian Community Development Banks (CDB),
   inspired by the Grameen Bank and devoted to reaching the poor of the
   poor. Secondly, the programs applied by some Public Development Banks
   (PDB) in Brazil to foster entrepreneurship through microcredit. Third,
   the Italian Credit Cooperatives (BCC - Banche di Credito Cooperativo),
   essential in the provision of credit for small enterprises and
   households. Despite their peculiarities, there are some similarities in
   their governance and methodologies applied to grant credit. The local
   dimension, the relationship lending to capture soft information for risk
   analysis, and the purpose of serving the community providing financial
   services instead of generating and distributing profits are standard
   features. These experiences could inspire a proposal for microfinance
   expansion, based on the ground principles of mutuality, solidarity,
   cooperation, and localism.},

Abstract = {Even though the conventional capitalist corporation is the globally
   dominant form of business organization, it may not be the most
   environmentally friendly. Given the need for a sustainable steady-state
   economic system, some other form of business organization will likely be
   required that uses natural resource inputs more efficiently and is less
   growth oriented than the typical corporation. An attractive alternative
   is the producer cooperative, where employment is accompanied by a right
   to democratic participation in organizational governance and a share of
   surplus earnings. A comparative theoretical analysis of cooperative and
   profit-maximizing corporate behavior suggests that cooperatives will
   tend to use natural resource inputs more efficiently and will be less
   growth oriented than corporations. The limited comparative empirical
   research that is available supports the greater input efficiency of
   cooperatives relative to corporations. This same research suggests that
   in fully employed economies, cooperatives will be less growth oriented
   than corporations, although where unemployment is substantial the
   reverse is likely. Environmentally sustainable full employment is
   theoretically achievable through workweek reductions.},

Title = {Influence of Cocoa Hybrids on Volatile Compounds of Fermented Beans,
   Microbial Diversity during Fermentation and Sensory Characteristics and
   Acceptance of Chocolates},

Abstract = {Microbial diversity, final concentration of volatiles compounds during
   fermentation and the characterization and acceptability of chocolates of
   three cocoa hybrids (PH 9, PH 15 and PH 16) were evaluated.
   Hanseniaspora uvarum, Pichia kluyveri, Pichia caribbica and
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the predominant yeasts in the three
   fermentations. Lactobacillus plantarum, Acetobacter pasteurianus,
   Bacillus cereus and Lysinibacillus fusiformis were the common bacterial
   species isolated from the fermentations. The PH 9 hybrid showed highest
   diversity of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria. Twenty-seven
   volatile compounds were identified during the cocoa fermentation of all
   hybrids. Chocolate from PH 9 hybrid had most desirable flavors and
   obtained the most ideal score in acceptance test. Chocolate from PH 15
   hybrid was considered the most bitter, acidic and astringent. Chocolates
   produced by different cocoa hybrids showed differences in sensory
   attributes and acceptance. Therefore, special management is required for
   the different hybrid fermentations to obtain high-quality chocolate.
   Practical ApplicationsAs a solution to the recovery of the cocoa crop in
   Brazil, many hybrids resistant to the disease called witches' broom were
   developed, but the impact of these crosses on cocoa quality,
   consequently in chocolate is not known. The producers' cooperatives and
   farmers of cocoa have no technical or scientific information about the
   behavior of cocoa hybrids during spontaneous fermentation process,
   which, oftentimes give rise to an uncontrolled fermentation of cocoa
   hybrids mixture. The results of this paper could be used among the
   producers' cooperatives and cocoa farmers for guidance about the
   influence of genetic improvement on the quality of cocoa fermented beans
   and chocolates, particularly among the three hybrids evaluated in this
   study.},

Abstract = {Which is the fundamental contradiction of capitalism: the capital-labor
   polarity or the contrast between socialized production and private
   appropriation? Those looking on the capital-labor polarity as the main
   contradiction will argue that socialism arises when the passage from a
   system controlled by capital owners to a system of worker-run firms
   sparks off the reversal of the usual capital-labor relation. Conversely,
   those who think that the key contradiction of capitalism is the contrast
   between socialized production and private appropriation will contend
   that the social order to rise from the ashes of capitalism is a
   centrally planned system. This paper reports arguments in support of the
   former option.},

Abstract = {This article begins by evoking Ruth First's influence on South Africa,
   and later in Mozambique, in compelling personal terms. Ruth First was an
   important commentator on the Alexandra Bus Boycott of 1957, in which the
   author participated. Some 20 years later, the author was recruited by
   First to the CEA, where he worked with Ruth First and others on labour
   migration, forced labour and on the newly established communal villages
   and agricultural producer cooperatives. First, although heavily involved
   in administration, nevertheless managed to find time for fieldwork of
   this kind. The author contributed to ongoing fieldwork at the CEA, and
   his results were fed into the teaching through his contribution of
   interviews, work songs and other material for the Mozambican Miner,
   later published as Black Gold. Examples are given of the directness of
   Ruth's criticisms, and of her sympathy for ordinary Mozambicans. The
   article concludes with recollections of responses made to the author on
   Ruth's death.},

Abstract = {The emerging field of common good socio-economics is promising not only
   for the preservation of common natural resources but also for common
   goods created by people through collective action, the importance of
   which has been emphasized by the recent financial and economic crisis.
   Based on the case of cooperative finance, this paper's outcomes are
   twofold. First, it shows that while the boundaries between the nature
   and property regime of goods may be relatively clear for natural common
   goods, they appear much more interlinked for human-made goods, where
   commons are embedded in intergenerational reciprocity. Second, it
   demonstrates that financial cooperatives can be understood as human-made
   commons and proposes a new way of thinking about public policies to
   design adequate legislation to protect these commons from isomorphism,
   privatization and destruction.},

Abstract = {According to total factor productivity trends in Chinese agriculture,
   China achieved productivity gains both when collectivising (1954-58) and
   when decollectivising (1979-84) its agriculture. If the productivity
   gains from decollectivisation were due mainly to eliminating the
   incentive problems of collective farms, how the initial collectivisation
   could also have been associated with gains in productivity presents a
   major historical puzzle, We suggest as an answer the possibility that
   agricultural production in China was widely organised on a household
   basis until 1958, despite the collectivisation of property rights, and
   that the formation of the agricultural producers' co-operatives reduced
   the inefficiencies in factor allocation that existed following China's
   land reform.},

Abstract = {This article provides a scenario-based analysis of how the European
   Union proposal for a new funding model for deposit insurance systems
   (DISs) would affect the Spanish banking sector. We examine the risk
   profiles of commercial banks, savings banks and credit cooperatives over
   the period 2007 to 2011 and compare the contributions to the deposit
   insurance fund (DIF) under the current flat-rate regime with those that
   would have occurred under the new risk-sensitive system. We find that a
   risk-based scheme could provide an incentive for sound management by
   reducing the premiums for credit institutions with better risk profiles.
   We also conclude that the proposed reform may help to mitigate the moral
   hazard associated with larger credit institutions.},

Abstract = {Consumers' concerns for the environment have led to the creation of
   niche markets, quality certifications and labelling systems. Built by
   activists and NGOs, these systems were adopted by agribusiness. Such
   firms try to capture consumers and react to opinion campaigns, whilst
   appropriating the conservation (or `fair') discourse. This leads to the
   rise of new forms of third-party certifications of food production based
   on private standards and, hence, to new forms of contract relations
   between producers and buyers. The nature of these relationships is not
   always evident in these new labels or in the discourse built to justify
   them. This is particularly so in the case of goods produced in the South
   to be traded and sold in the North, as the case of Starbucks
   illustrates. By the end of the 1990s, Starbucks, operating through an
   NGO called Conservation International (CI), arrived at the region of El
   Triunfo, in Chiapas, and contacted the producers' cooperatives that were
   trying to find a market for their product. Cl promoted Starbucks
   standards to raise the coffee quality and won the control over the
   production system. Meanwhile, the producers forced to sell their coffee
   through the largest trade company (AMSA) against whom the cooperatives
   were created, lost the control over their own organization. When some
   cooperatives refused the deal, they suffered divisions but could survive
   thanks the Fair Trade (FT) network in Chiapas.},

   rising left. But new evidence shows that PR strengthens the left and
   redistribution, and we argue the standard view is wrong historically,
   analytically, and empirically. We offer a radically different
   explanation. Integrating two opposed interpretations of PR-minimum
   winning coalitions versus consensus-we propose that the right adopted PR
   when their support for consensual regulatory frameworks, especially
   those of labor markets and skill formation where co-specific investments
   were important, outweighed their opposition to the redistributive
   consequences; this occurred in countries with previously densely
   organized local economies. In countries with adversarial industrial
   relations, and weak coordination of business and unions, keeping
   majoritarian institutions helped contain the left. This explains the
   close association between current varieties of capitalism and electoral
   institutions, and why they persist over time.},

Abstract = {As a supplement to the financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises,
   bank microfinance companies are nonbank financial institutions, and it
   has played an active role in maintaining the stability of financial
   markets. However, in the course of the operation of microfinance
   companies, due to the lack of careful management and risk control, the
   problem of risk management has become increasingly prominent. The
   purpose of this paper is to study the microfinance risk based on
   polygenic artificial neural network, and it provides theory and practice
   application for risk management of microcredit enterprises. Taking the
   risk management of China's microfinance companies as the research
   object, on the basis of previous studies, this paper analyzes the risks
   of bank microfinance companies. Secondly, the basic theory of neural
   network model and its transformation function are introduced, and the
   learning method of neural network. At the same time, the learning
   algorithm of neural network and its improved algorithm are mainly
   introduced. It lays a theoretical foundation for the follow-up empirical
   research. Then, through the empirical study of data-based risk
   assessment of microcredit of farmers, the sample data are divided into
   training samples and test samples for comparison. Then, we use MATLAB
   software to establish a neural network model for farmers' microcredit
   risk assessment. Finally, in order to make the neural network model of
   farmers' credit risk assessment better popularize and apply, and
   effectively reduce the credit risk of farmers' microcredit. The
   corresponding policy suggestions are put forward, which proves the
   validity and applicability of the neural network in the field of
   farmers' microcredit risk assessment. It provides a good basis for rural
   credit cooperatives to identify the credit risk of farmers.},

Title = {A comparative analysis of banking institutions: examining quiet life},
Journal = {MANAGERIAL FINANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},
Number = {6},
Pages = {726-743},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance of
   banking institutions in Costa Rica over the period 2004-2014.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper employs system GMM, dynamic panel
   data and traditional financial hypothesis framework to analyze bank
   performance and assess marketplace sustainability for a sample of
   commercial and cooperative banks from Costa Rica. In the assessment, the
   authors visit the relative market power, structure conduct performance
   (SCP) and efficient structure literature.
   Findings Market share (MS) is positively related to performance whereas
   the authors find a negative effect of market concentration
   (Herfindahl-Hirschman index) on bank profits, thereby refuting the SCP
   hypothesis. The authors accept the quiet life hypothesis within Costa
   Rican banks since a moderate level of profit persistence is detected.
   Commercial banks are less profitable. Yet when crisis is introduced to
   the models, it has a significant and negative impact on overall bank
   performance.
   Research limitations/implications The authors selected years and banks
   based on available data plus default information in the relevant
   database. More insights can be gained from post-2014 developments.
   Practical implications The current results and conclusions have
   implications for developing economies (and economic development, in
   general) by showing that the traditional understanding of cooperative
   bank model as better for the public good may not be necessarily true.
   They offer insight into the understanding of how different bank-type
   institutions affect the public good. Furthermore, expanding the research
   to Latin America in order to directly compare commercial and cooperative
   enterprises via a meta-frontier technique would help buttress this
   evidence.
   Originality/value This is the most recent study to provide such an
   investigation for a Latin American country with a sizable MS for
   cooperative and public sector banks. The paper offers analysis that has
   been limited in Latin American banking markets thus far.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to identify the challenges of crop production
   and marketing in southwest Ethiopia. Primary and secondary sources of
   data were used. Qualitative and Quantitative data types were collected
   from 385 respondents through interviews, focus group discussion, key
   informant interviews, and observations. The collected data were analyzed
   by using descriptive statistics and econometric models. Crop
   productivity was analyzed by the Cobb Douglas model and its efficiency
   and determinants were identified by the stochastic frontier model. The
   major bottlenecks of crop production were the low attitude of farmers
   towards improved technology, low supply and usage of improved seed
   varieties (94.5\%), low supply and use of fertilizers (95\%), knowledge
   and skill gap of farmers (80.1\%), poor extension service (57.3\%), soil
   acidity (94.8\%), diseases and insect pest (77.8\%), conflict (84.9\%)
   and the outbreak of human diseases (60\%). Marketing challenges were
   poor infrastructure (87.3\%), lack of market linkage (62.5\%), and lack
   of credit services (70.6\%). The Cobb Douglas model result revealed that
   land size, local seed, improved seed, repetition of weeding, and labor
   force influenced crop productivity. The mean level of crop technical
   efficiency was 51.3\%. Education level, extension service, access to
   credit, cooperative membership, number of livestock owned, and soil
   fertility were influenced crop inefficiency negatively and distance to
   the farm was positively related to technical inefficiency. Improving
   extension services and skill of farmers through practical based training
   and building capacity of extension workers and systems to enhance the
   attitude of farmers towards technology usage and proper management
   practices, timely provision of farm inputs, improving road and market
   access, and provision of credit services to producers were some of the
   recommendations forwarded to alleviate crop production and marketing
   challenges in the study areas.},

Abstract = {This article shows how paramilitaries and allied companies put
   grassroots development discourses of political participation and
   subsidiarity, environmental conservation, and ethnic empowerment to work
   in executing and ratifying their massive land grab in northwest
   Colombia. More than a case of trying to ``whitewash{''} their
   malfeasance with fashionable and politically correct development-speak,
   I argue that the grassroots development apparatus its discourses,
   institutional forms, and practices became utterly instrumental to the
   illegal land seizures. Moreover, when operating alongside practices of
   land parcelization, iterative transactions, producers' cooperatives, and
   third-party intermediaries, grassroots development facilitated what
   could be called ``land laundering.{''} In the process, grassroots
   development became a conduit for paramilitary-backed state formation in
   which projects of liberal governance commonly associated with the
   imperatives of institution building, good governance, and the rule of
   law became perversely compatible with the region's economies of
   violence. With the World Bank increasingly concerned over the conflation
   of fragile states, violent conflict, and alarming land grabs, this
   article raises questions about how the grassroots solutions currently
   being endorsed by the Bank can in some cases actually facilitate
   dispossession, illicit economies, and violent political projects. The
   way paramilitaries harnessed grassroots development also has critical
   implications for debates about post-development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This article examines the institutional linkages between three women
   workers' co-operatives, the first women's credit co-operative in China,
   and the co-operative support organization, the International Committee
   for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Go-operatives (ICCIC). The study
   shows that Chinese women in rural areas have increasingly adopted
   co-operatives as a form of organization in their efforts to address the
   problem of their lack of access to resources, including land, credit,
   jobs, training and information, and to participate in the mainstream
   economy as an organized forcer This article demonstrates that stronger
   institutional linkages between local offices of the All-China Women's
   Federation and the ICCIC encourage the growth of women's co-operative
   activities. It raises two sets of policy issues that are central to the
   development of co-operatives and women's banking: the continued growth
   of these activities will depend upon the government adopting legislation
   to define the legal framework governing co-operative relations and
   management systems, and establishing gender-inclusive policies to
   increase credit to women's income-generating activities.},

Title = {DIAGNOSTICS BY FINANCIAL REGULATORS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
   PREPAREDNESS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY MANAGEMENT},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {106-115},
Abstract = {In the conditions of the financial system destabilization in Ukraine,
   caused by such negative phenomena as military actions in the East, the
   economic downturn, political and financial crises, population
   disappointment in the institution of power and loss of the people's
   confidence in power structures and so on, market mechanisms are not able
   to ensure the restoration of the national financial market and to
   encourage its professional participants to use mechanisms of protection
   their own assets and the assets of their clients from external and
   internal threats actively. State interference in the functioning of
   financial institutions is necessary, especially for those of their
   types, whose bankruptcy may have fatal consequences for the welfare of
   the population and cause the liquidation of economic entities of the
   domestic economy. Among them are: banks, insurance companies, credit
   unions, and other institutions of credit co-operation, investment
   companies, in particular, joint investment institutions (unit and
   corporate investment funds), non-state pension funds, leasing,
   factoring, and other financial companies, pawns, etc. Therefore, it is
   expedient to consider the possibility of the influence of state
   regulators in financial services markets on the state of their
   participants' economic security. However, the study of the realities of
   the financial market of Ukraine development has made it possible to
   assert that for a number of financial institutions, the concept of
   economic security is something abstract, and the understanding by their
   top management the importance of economic security management, taking
   into account the negative market trends, is completely absent. So, the
   purpose of this study is to diagnose the level of financial institutions
   preparedness for the implementation of economic security management into
   their common system of management. The high level of financial market
   participants' readiness for safe-oriented management will allow
   regulators to rapidly implement in their practice a list of
   recommendations that will minimize the threat of bankruptcy and
   liquidation of domestic financial institutions. Methodology. In the
   process of preparing a scientific article, a great number of literary
   sources was considered. Some of them were developed using the method of
   theoretical generalization and the monographic method. The theoretical
   results presented in the research materials were obtained on the basis
   of the study of works of such scientists as Amadae S. M., Baily M. N.,
   Elliott D. J., Ismail Z., Johnson K. N., Mirtchev A., Nelson J. A.,
   Raczkowski K., Schneider F., Sidek Z. M., Ula M., Whalen C. J.,
   Wierzbicka E., Yong J. To confirm the reliability of the scientific
   results presented in the article, the authors used the Delphi method and
   expert evaluation. The list of indicators for assessing the level of
   financial institutions readiness for the implementation of a mechanism
   for managing economic security in the following five areas is formed.
   These areas are: the availability and condition of the economic security
   system, the state of information and analytical support for the adoption
   of management decisions in the field of economic security, the state of
   intellectual and personnel management provision of economic security,
   reserves of financial support of economic security, the level of
   external influence on the state of economic security (state regulation
   and supervision).
   In May 2018, representatives of the top management of various types of
   financial institutions, scientists, researchers, and analysts who were
   interested in the issues of economic security management of the
   financial sector were interviewed. Their answers were analysed and the
   level of readiness for managing the economic security of the most common
   types of financial institutions in the financial market of Ukraine was
   determined. Using the graphical method, the obtained scientific results
   are presented in a convenient and understandable form for the perception
   of all interested persons. Results of the survey. The necessity of
   carrying out diagnostics of the readiness to manage economic security at
   the level of state regulatory bodies and at the level of top management
   of financial institutions in the near future is substantiated. A
   large-scale analytical work was carried out on determining the
   parameters of financial institutions readiness for the continuous and
   professional economic security management, which should be carried out
   with the use of a systematic approach. Based on expert opinions, a
   preliminary assessment of the various types of financial intermediaries'
   readiness to integrate security-oriented management into the financial
   institutions' common management system was made. Practical implications.
   The proposed methodological approach for assessing the level of
   financial institutions readiness to manage their own economic security
   should be used by the state regulators of the financial market, in
   particular, by the National Bank of Ukraine and the National Commission,
   which performs state regulation in the field of financial services
   markets, to monitor the activities of professional financial market
   participants in order to conduct advisory and consultative work with
   their owners and managers, as well as for the development of strategic
   guidelines for the provision of the state financial security. It is
   desirable to implement into the practical activities of financial
   intermediaries our proposals for increasing the readiness for
   implementation of the economic security management mechanism in the
   existing systems of management. Value/originality. For the first time, a
   scoring methodology was prepared for assessing the level of financial
   institutions readiness for the implementation of economic security
   management as an independent direction of management, and not as one of
   the tasks of other types of their management activity. At the
   theoretical level, the substantive interpretation of the notion of the
   readiness of financial institutions to manage their own economic
   security is proposed. The reasons for the impossibility of the modern
   financial institutions to manage their own economic security effectively
   are identified, and a few suggestions to minimize their number in the
   near future were made.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {1021-1034},
Abstract = {After World War II, Japan's policy makers believed that common forests
   were underutilized because of their legal status and organization method
   under customary iriai-type ownership and that modern ownership in the
   form of group ownership, such as forest producers' cooperatives, or as
   individual, separate ownership, would improve the situation. Thus, the
   Common Forests Modernization Act of 1966 was enacted, following
   successive modernization policies since the Meiji Restoration in 1868.
   We evaluated the impacts of the past modernization policies on the
   management of common forests by statistically comparing the performance
   of modernized and non-modernized 19,690 common forests based on the
   World Census of Agriculture and Forestry 2000. The performance measures
   for comparison included planting, weeding, thinning, and harvesting
   activities. We found less modernized, customary holdings are more active
   in tending activities such as weeding and thinning, while modernized
   holdings may have an advantage in harvesting and timber sales.},

Title = {Credible risk: private credit bureaus and the work of loan officers in
   West Africa},
Journal = {AFRICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Pages = {625-643},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In 2015, the Central Bank of West African States selected a private
   credit bureau to build a digital platform to collect and analyse
   financial data across the eight-country West African Economic and
   Monetary Union, including the activities of credit cooperatives and
   microfinance agencies that serve many West African borrowers. The
   credit-reporting platform promises to produce new and valuable knowledge
   about borrowers' creditworthiness and risk. But valuable in what ways
   and for whom? Private credit bureaus rely on vast arrays of personal and
   financial data in order to produce credit reports and consumer credit
   scores that claim to represent the creditworthiness of individual
   borrowers. Cooperative loan officers, instead, understand
   creditworthiness to be highly variable and rely on relational metrics in
   order to determine risk as well as carefully overseeing existing loans
   to ensure their timely repayment. Based on ethnographic fieldwork with
   loan officers at a small-scale credit cooperative in Lome, Togo, this
   article examines how the impending arrival of a private credit bureau
   and new credit-reporting technologies highlights the distinction between
   the ways in which credit bureaus and loan officers understand the nature
   of financial risk, as well as the centrality of loan officers and their
   management of borrower debt in sustaining the field of small-scale
   lending in Togo.
   Resume En 2015, la Banque centrale des etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest a
   choisi un etablissement prive de credit pour developper une plateforme
   numerique destinee a collecter et a analyser des donnees financieres
   dans les huit pays de l'Union economique et monetaire ouest-africaine, y
   compris pour les activites des cooperatives de credit et des
   institutions de microcredit auxquelles ont recours de nombreux
   emprunteurs ouest-africains. Cette plateforme de reporting du credit
   promet d'apporter des informations nouvelles et precieuses sur la
   solvabilite et le risque des emprunteurs. Mais precieuses en quelle
   maniere et pour qui ? Les etablissements prives de credit s'appuient sur
   un vaste eventail de donnees personnelles et financieres pour produire
   des rapports de credit et des scores de credit a la consommation qui
   affirment representer la solvabilite des emprunteurs individuels. Les
   charges de prets cooperatifs, quant a eux, conscients de la large
   variabilite de la solvabilite, s'appuient sur des metriques
   relationnelles pour determiner le risque et surveiller attentivement les
   prets existants pour s'assurer que les echeances de remboursement sont
   respectees. Base sur des travaux ethnographiques menes sur le terrain
   aupres de charges de prets d'une cooperative de microcredit de Lome
   (Togo), cet article examine comment l'arrivee prochaine d'un
   etablissement prive de credit et de nouvelles technologies de reporting
   du credit met en evidence la distinction les manieres dont les
   etablissements de credit et les charges de prets comprennent la nature
   du risque financier, ainsi que le role central des charges de prets et
   leur gestion de la dette des emprunteurs dans le maintien du secteur du

Abstract = {There is active debate in transition economies about the extent to which
   employee and foreign ownership ought to be encouraged or discouraged in
   privatization, but empirical evidence is scarce. This paper employs a
   unique data set on Slovene firms during an early period of `'spontaneous
   privatization.'' Characteristics of the incidence of employee and
   foreign ownership and associated firm performance are examined. The
   paper controls for simultaneity between privatization and firm
   performance using a two-stage Tobit least-squares procedure. An
   elasticity of output with respect to ownership type is estimated. A
   percentage point increase in foreign ownership is associated with about
   a 3.9\% increase in value-added and for employee ownership with about a
   1.4\% increase. there is evidence of diminishing marginal productivity
   gains for both forms of ownership. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Using two new data sets from France, the authors present die first study
   of the comparative productivity of labor-managed and conventional firms
   involving large representative samples of firms in a range of industries
   including services. Their study offers new stylized facts on
   labor-managed firms, and disentangles incentive effects from those of
   differences in input demand behavior on factor elasticities. Contrary to
   received wisdom, labor-managed firms are not smaller than conventional
   firms; they grow as fast or faster in all industries. The two groups of
   firms organize production differently. Labor-managed firms are as
   productive as conventional firms, or more productive, in all industries,
   and use their inputs efficiently; but in several industries conventional
   firms would produce more with their current input levels if they
   organized production like labor-managed firms. On average overall, firms
   would produce more using the labor-managed firms' industry-specific
   technologies. Labor-managed firms do not produce at inefficiently low
   scales.},

Abstract = {We ask how the scope for non-profit objectives in a state-owned
   enterprise (SOE) in a mixed oligopoly changes because of competition
   from firms in another country. There is no change if costs and demand
   are given, unless the trade partner is a low-cost country. However, the
   scope for non-profit objectives is limited by the country's relative
   size if wages are market-clearing and if workers and firms are
   stationary, because of reduced competitiveness caused by higher real
   wage rates. The total surplus is then not affected by the actions of the
   SOE. International trade does not otherwise reduce the scope for its
   non-profit objectives if workers and firms are mobile, but productivity
   differences might require restrictions in order to avoid a complete
   relocation of the workforce in either country.},

Abstract = {Various theories suggest that worker-managed firms (WMFs) are prone to
   failure in competitive environments. Using a long panel of Uruguayan
   firms, the author presents new evidence on firm survival by comparing
   WMFs with conventional firms. After excluding microenterprises and
   controlling for differences in the effective tax burden faced by the two
   types of firms, the hazard of dissolution is 29\% lower for WMFs than
   for conventional firms. This result is robust to alternative estimation
   strategies based on semiparametric and parametric frailty duration
   models that take into account unobserved firm-level heterogeneity and
   impose a range of distributional assumptions about the shape of the
   baseline hazard. The higher survival rates of worker-managed firms seem
   to be associated with their greater employment stability. This evidence
   suggests that the marginal presence of WMFs in actual market economies
   cannot be explained by the fact that these firms are less likely to
   survive than conventional firms.},

Abstract = {In horticulture contemporary globalization is associated with (at least)
   two connected processes - the concentration, centralization and
   expanding reach of global retailers and the emergence of numerous new
   sites of export horticulture specializing in fresh fruit and vegetable
   production aimed at metropolitan markets. Whilst there have been
   numerous studies about developmental impacts, conditions of labour, and
   producers' upgrading strategies within this new context, few studies
   give much, if any, space to explaining and analyzing the processes
   through which these new regions have come into being. This article
   provides a detailed account of the emergence and global integration of
   one of these new sites - the Sao Francisco valley grape branch in North
   East Brazil, within the context of the wider regional fruiticulture
   sector. It focuses on state activities and incentives, the provenance of
   grape producers and their organizations, and grape branch composition.},

Abstract = {Five-category loan classification (FCLC) is an international financial
   regulation approach. Recently, the application and implementation of
   FCLC in the Chinese micro finance bank has mostly relied on subjective
   judgment, and it is difficult to control and lower loan risk. In view of
   this, this paper is dedicated to researching and solving this problem by
   constructing the FCLC model based on improved particle-swarm
   optimization (PSO) and the multiclass, least-square, support-vector
   machine (LS-SVM). First, LS-SVM is the extension of SVM, which is
   proposed to achieve multiclass classification. Then, improved PSO is
   employed to determine the parameters of multiclass LS-SVM for improving
   classification accuracy. Finally, some experiments are carried out based
   on rural credit cooperative data to demonstrate the performance of our
   proposed model. The results show that the proposed model makes a
   distinct improvement in the accuracy rate compared with one-vs.-one
   (1-v-1) LS-SVM, one-vs.-rest (1-v-r) LS-SVM, 1-v-1 SVM, and 1-v-r SVM.
   In addition, it is an effective tool in solving the problem of loan-risk
   rating.},

Title = {CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN THE COOPERATIVE BANKING SECTOR IN POLAND},

Abstract = {The corporate governance principles in the cooperative banking play
   crucial role in complementing institutional supervision and supporting
   internal controls. This paper discusses the selected issues of corporate
   governance in the cooperative banking sector in Poland. It outlines the
   contemporary challenges of corporate governance principles in the Polish
   cooperative banking sector related to external and internal supervision
   of banking activity. In addition, this paper aims to answer the question
   whether and to what extent the Polish cooperative banks have adopted the
   recommendation of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority with regard
   to corporate governance in the banking sector and the extent to which
   internal rules for the organization of these banks affect the efficiency
   and effectiveness of the market. As a result, the following hypothesis
   was put forward: implementation of the corporate governance principles
   in the Polish cooperative banks has not contributed significantly to the
   improvement of their efficiency and has not enhanced the institutional
   supervision and internal controls in the cooperative banks. According to
   the authors, despite the existence of corporate governance principles in
   all Polish cooperative banks, there is still problem with the
   effectiveness of these institutions. Cooperative banks in Poland have
   experienced the phase of lethargy since 2013 and reported weaker and
   weaker financial results. Having in mind the fact that in 2015, that is
   after 14 years of stability in the sector, one of the Polish largest
   cooperative banks, SK-Bank, got bankruptcy, nobody predicted this event.
   It concludes that when it comes to the corporate governance principles
   the management bodies, regulators as well as supervisors require more
   effectively cooperation. The results in this paper confirmed that the
   model of credit cooperative movement adopted in Poland requires
   implementation of a couple of basic changes that are directly related to
   the utilization of the principles of a good corporate governance. The
   current corporate governance rules in Polish cooperative banks lead to
   having standardised governance without any substantial improvements and
   promoting better governance.},

Abstract = {Coffee cooperatives from the Huatusco region in Mexico have played an
   important role in helping coffee farmers in this region maintain
   economic viability in the midst of the economic crisis in Mexico and the
   international crisis of the coffee sector over time. While this type of
   organization has played an important role, not all of those
   organizations have survived over time. Using information from interviews
   with leaders of five longeval coffee producer cooperatives in the
   Huatusco coffee region, this study aims to identify the coffee
   cooperatives characteristics that can explain the longevity and
   long-term sustainability of these organizations. Additionally, using
   information from interviews, we evaluated challenges that could put at
   risk the long-term sustainability of these associations and strategies
   to overcome these challenges from the cooperative leadership
   perspective. Findings from this study suggest that motivations behind
   the creation of these producer associations go beyond accessing
   government resources. An institutional structure where there is a
   democratic process behind the election of leaders, leadership positions
   with predefined, not long, tenure terms, and association strategies to
   increase member engagement could explain the longevity of these
   organizations. Regarding challenges the cooperatives may be facing in
   the future, the aging population of growers is perceived by cooperative
   leaders as one of the major challenges they may be facing. Increasing
   youth involvement in the cooperatives through training and educational
   activities was perceived by cooperative leaders as a strategy to
   overcome this challenge.},

Abstract = {Indonesia has long history of microfinance (MFI) services in both rural
   and urban areas. Access to financial services has allowed many
   low-income families to make significant progress in their own efforts to
   escape poverty. The government supports the growth of MFI services
   through many instruments, such as regulations, subsidy, and directed
   credit policies. Currently, there are two broad classification of
   microfince institutions in Indonesia, i.e., bank-MFIs such as BM's Unit
   Desas and rural banks (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat-BPR), and non-bank MFIs
   such as credit cooperatives (Koperasi), Islamic microfinance (such as
   Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, BMT), rotary-club saving (arisan), etc. As a
   business unit, the MFIs must follow the principle of efficiency to
   survive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of
   one type of the MFI in Indonesia, namely Syariahrural banks (BPR-S). The
   common approach to measure the level of efficiency of a business unit
   used by management is financial approach, such as ratio of operating
   expenses to operating income. However, economists normally use
   production function approach or its derivation to measure the
   efficiency. We are comparing the two approaches to evaluate the
   efficiency levels of the BPR-S. The results show that the efficiency
   levels of the BPR-S are generally operating in a good efficiency.
   Efficiently ratios of BPR-S during the sample period of time have been
   mostly above 90\%. The efficiency based on the financial ratios confirms
   the finding from the production function approach. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Title = {Farmers' perception and preference of Islamic Banking in Turkey},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},
Number = {5},
Pages = {871-889},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that
   influence farmers' preference for the use of Islamic banks in Turkey and
   to investigate their knowledge level and perception about Islamic
   finance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Survey data used in this study is obtained
   by drawing a sample of 1902 farmers who are members of the Agricultural
   Credit Cooperatives Union (ACCU) from 37 provinces of Turkey. Pearson's
   Chi-square test is used to analyze the association between the
   demographic features of farmers, conventional bank usage and Islamic
   bank usage. Binary logistic regression model is used to estimate the
   factors influencing the preference for Islamic banks. Explanatory
   variables include knowledge on Islamic banking and finance, perception
   of compliance to religion, saving ability and cost concern along with
   the control variables of Islamic bank branch number in the region and
   age of respondent. Robustness check is conducted via alternative models
   using ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression.
   Findings - Less than 10\% of the participant farmers use Islamic banks
   and 59\% declare they know nothing about Islamic banking. Age, education
   level, income level, nonagricultural income level, saving ability,
   duration of working in agriculture, land size and region are
   significantly related to farmers' preference of using Islamic banks.
   Knowledge level, perception of religious compliance, saving ability and
   cost concern are statistically significant factors that influence the
   probability of using Islamic banks.
   Research limitations/implications - This study does not include the
   analysis of the relationship between being religious and using Islamic
   banks because questions related to the assessment of religious practice
   were excluded due to the ACCU's sensitivity to investigate personal
   beliefs. Therefore, future studies can expand the scope of this research
   by investigating religiousness. The sample is chosen from the ACCU
   members who are already benefiting from a formal source of credit;
   therefore, the results should not be attributed to all farmers.
   Practical implications - Islamic banks and microfinance institutions'
   further engagement in the agricultural sector and ACCU's implementation
   of Islamic finance instruments. Social implications - Islamic banks'
   further diversification in the agricultural sector and ACCU's
   implementation of Islamic finance instruments.
   Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is
   the first to investigate the farmers' perception and preference of
   Islamic banking in Turkey. The sample size of 1902 is much larger and
   geographically diversified compared to studies in agricultural finance.
   This study will be valuable for the agricultural finance empirical
   studies in Turkey as well as an important addition to the emerging
   literature on Islamic finance.},

Abstract = {This study was embarked upon to evaluate the performance of micro
   broiler businesses in Calabar metropolis. The objectives of the study
   included; to describe the socioeconomic characteristics of broiler
   business owners, to analyse the effects of selected socio-economic
   characteristics of micro broiler business owners on the survival of
   micro broiler businesses in Calabar metropolis, and to analyze the
   marketing mix and managerial practices of business owners in Calabar
   metropolis. It made use of primary data obtained from a random sample of
   112 micro broiler operators. The data were analyzed using descriptive
   statistics, and Ordinary Least Square Multiple regression approach. The
   result of analysis revealed that micro broiler business ownership is
   almost evenly distributed among males 47.32 percent and females 52.68
   percent; and that more than half (56.25 percent) of the respondents are
   within the age brackets of 36-45 years. The study also revealed that
   respondents had one form of formal education or the other with tertiary
   education accounting for 75.89 percent. On the survival/competitive
   advantage of micro broiler firms in the study area, the result of
   Ordinary Least Square analysis showed that output of broiler, flock
   size, business experience, mortality and extension contact significantly
   contributed to a firm survival in broiler business. The study revealed
   that firms applied some management practices and marketing mix
   activities in operating their businesses. The managerial practices
   adopted and their mean weights included; planning (M = 3.80), organizing
   (M = 3.47), directing (M = 3.80), coordinating (M = 3.63) and
   controlling (M = 3.91). Also, the analysis showed that the marketing mix
   practices adopted and their mean values were; product (M = 3.23), price
   (M = 3.04), place (M = 3.77) and promotion (M = 2.26). The study shows
   that micro broiler operators showed positive attitude to all the
   management function and marketing mix practices. The study recommended
   that micro broiler operators should organize themselves into cooperative
   societies to enable them enjoy the benefits of economies of size and
   credit facilities from lending agencies. It was also recommended that
   relevant extension services should be made available to broiler
   operators to improve their skills and knowledge in broiler business
   operations. Policy action of government should be directed towards
   capacity utilization of operators. Also, subsidies should be provided
   for cost of feeds and day old chicks as well as instituting a flexible
   credit policy to reduce cost of production.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to strategic cost management in the
   value chain of milk. We searched the products pasteurized whole milk
   long life (UHT) pasteurized whole milk and Type C (in bags). The
   research is a case study, in which the average values were used, paid
   and received for the month of January 2009. The data collection
   instruments used were a literature review, desk review of company
   documents, on-site observation and interviews with company managers. The
   results show that all stages of the value chain realize profits from the
   producer to the distributor, and the smaller portion was for the
   producer and the largest in the industry. It is concluded that the
   manufacturing industry contributed the largest share of final consumer
   price. It cost elements are the most representative raw material and
   transport (production costs), as well as in the case of long life UHT
   milk, the packaging, which accounts for 19\% of the amount paid by the
   consumer. Moreover, it is suggested that the role of key players -
   producers' cooperatives, manufacturers and distributors - and the impact
   of their logistics costs in the final price targets of future studies.},

Abstract = {The literature on worker cooperatives is dominated by explanations of
   why they do not work and why, accordingly, they are so rare. This
   Article presents a case study of a large worker cooperative in South
   India that has worked well for a long time. This cooperative
   illustrates, among other things, that worker control and worker
   democracy are not necessarily inconsistent with the degree of hierarchy
   and delegation that may be essential to effective operation. The
   cooperative has been able to compete despite paying wages and benefits
   that are dramatically higher than those paid by its competitors, while
   at the same time providing far better working conditions. How it has
   been able to do this is something of a puzzle. Part of the explanation
   is good fortune at its inception in attracting effective, honest, and
   dedicated managers and, subsequently, in avoiding government involvement
   and in being able to ignore cumbersome and unsuitable legal rules.
   Perhaps more important is the workplace culture and the ability to
   harness forms of mutual monitoring not available to competitors. At the
   end of the day, it is unclear how much of the success of the cooperative
   is a function of its cooperative nature and how much is a product of its
   unique circumstances. Still, the story of this enterprise offers useful
   lessons in the organization of economic activity, particularly in the
   importance of nonlegal mechanisms for maximizing individual cooperative
   productivity.},

Abstract = {Very different commodity chains had been established over the centuries
   in France to produce and sell wines as diverse as champagne, fine old
   clarets, or ordinary table wines. The major shortages caused by the vine
   disease phylloxera after 1875 forced merchants to search for new sources
   of supply, often in foreign countries or through the production of
   artificial wines. When domestic production revived, however, the
   recovery was not accompanied by a noticeable reduction in these new
   supplies, with the result that prices, as well as growers'
   profitability, fell sharply after the turn of the twentieth century,
   strengthening the merchants' power in the various commodity chains. To
   overcome this situation, growers in three very different wine-producing
   areas, namely the Midi, Bordeaux, and Champagne, used their political
   influence to achieve government intervention in order to control fraud
   and establish regional appellations or producer cooperatives, which
   helped them win back some of their market power from merchants.},

Abstract = {This paper provides new evidence on the objectives pursued by
   worker-managed firms (WMFs). The basic neoclassical model assumes that
   WMFs maximizes net income per member instead of total profits (Ward,
   1958). Even though it has been largely criticized, the Ward model has
   dominated the self-management literature. Alternative models suggest
   that WMFs are not only concerned about income per worker but also about
   the level of employment. However, the empirical content of these
   competing theoretical models has been rarely analyzed. This paper
   contributes to fill this gap by estimating the parameters of a generic
   welfare function, following the methodology proposed by Craig and
   Pencavel (1993). These parameters determine the relative importance that
   a WMF places on income per worker vis-a-vis the level of employment.
   Estimates are based on a long micro-panel of Uruguayan firms covering
   the entire population of Uruguayan worker-managed firm and conventional
   firms in 31 3-digit sectors over the period April 1996-December 2005.
   Following a strictly neoclassical framework, but simply allowing a more
   general specification of the WMF goals, we show that the assumption of
   the basic neoclassical model of the WMF is misleading. Our results
   support the view that WMFs are concerned with both employment and income
   per worker. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cooperatives have gained prominent attention in recent years as
   strategic elements to achieve sustainable economic development and
   greater social cohesion in the context of neoliberal globalization. This
   article explores, theoretically, the current challenges and
   opportunities for cooperatives to develop successfully in the
   globalizing economy. To this end, we provide an analytical, critical
   review of the key bibliography concerning some fundamental aspects that
   shape the relationship between economic globalization and cooperatives,
   an issue that has been generally neglected by previous literature. Three
   key fields are addressed: 1) the viability of cooperatives, based on
   their strengths and possible weaknesses, under current globalization; 2)
   the role of these organizations in promoting the local development and
   stability of local communities; and 3) the tensions and potentialities
   that internationalization entails for cooperatives. Based on the
   analytical review and the organization of the literature, we propose an
   agenda for further research. This includes some hypotheses and
   strategies for testing them that would be essential to assess the role
   of cooperatives in economic globalization, and sheds light on key areas
   for future research that could provide a better understanding of the
   complexity surrounding the relationship between globalization and
   cooperatives.},

Abstract = {Food security is one of the main goals of rural poor people. To enhance
   food security in this context, participatory action research can help to
   ensure sustained success while considering entire food value chains
   (FVC). This paper assesses the feasibility and potential success of
   upgrading strategies (UPS) as well as their assessment criteria as
   developed by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists. The results
   form part of a larger participatory research project conducted in two
   climatically representative regions of Tanzania: semi-arid Dodoma and
   subhumid Morogoro. This paper presents the findings with respect to food
   processing, waste management and bioenergy, along with income generation
   and market participation. Assessments on other components of the FVC,
   including natural resource management, crop production and consumption,
   are reported by Graef et al (2015). The assessments for food processing
   revealed preferences for preservation techniques, oil extraction
   processes and food storage devices for the semi-arid region. In
   contrast, in the subhumid region, the experts favoured food storage
   devices and preservation techniques. Assessments of waste management and
   bioenergy UPS for both regions indicated the importance of animal feed
   from crop residues, crop residues as mulch and compost from food waste,
   although with somewhat different priorities. Assessments on income
   generation and markets in both regions revealed preferences for savings
   and credit cooperatives and communication techniques, but also indicated
   that warehouse receipt systems and guarantee systems had a high impact.
   Assessments differed between the two different climatic regions, and to
   some extent also between the nationality of experts and their gender.
   The authors therefore attach importance to integrating different
   South-North and female-male awareness in assessments among scientists.
   Moreover, local and/or regional stakeholders and experts should be
   involved in developing site-adapted UPS for enhancing FVCs.},

Title = {DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN ETHIOPIA SINCE THE 1975 LAND-REFORM},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS},

Abstract = {A stated objective of the Ethiopian Government since it came to power in
   1975 has been to increase the production of crops for both domestic
   consumption and export. Consequently, a number of plans and programs
   have been proposed and implemented to bring about such development in
   Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro review of
   the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land
   reform of 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the
   population growth as evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of
   population (3\%) and food production (1.8\%) over the period from 1970
   to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further deteriorated.
   Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable
   for agriculture, but only about 19\% is cultivated. This suggests an
   underutilisation of land. Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent
   subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and
   education which are essential to development have not been given due
   attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural
   technologies used by farmers have changed little in this century.
   Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most potent economic
   force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to
   expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from
   the central government. Some 85\%, 50\%, and 79\% of total agricultural
   credit, fertiliser and improved seeds respectively go directly to
   socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which,
   up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5\% of the total cultivated
   land and 4\% of the national crop production. The favouring of
   large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises with
   credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting smallholders,
   has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in
   Ethiopia. Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no
   significant development of agriculture in Ethiopia following the 1975
   land reform.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Collective action for quality differentiation of food products linked to
   a territory is a long-term process. It is often hindered by a lack of
   understanding of multilevel institutional dynamics. This article aims at
   conducting a socio-historical analysis of the institutional context
   allowing the development of a specific cheese value-chain in the
   province of Trento (Italian Alps). Using Ostrom's institutionalist
   approach, we conducted a historical analysis of the formal and informal
   multilevel institutions. Our results showed that a subsistence economy
   prevailed between 1800 and 1950, which implied little commitment from
   the producers to build up collective organisations, despite government
   and church incentives. When the ``modernisation{''} of agriculture
   started around 1950, it meant that the production could be intended for
   the market, which enabled the development of producers' cooperatives.
   The province became autonomous in 1948 and supported those local
   dynamics. Since then, we have observed an increasing level of trust
   among the different local actors and towards the provincial government.
   Since 2000, the valorisation of cheese specificity has become a central
   strategy to face competition at different levels. However, at the same
   time the production has undergone intensification. This leads to a loss
   of the link between product and territory. The future challenge is
   therefore to implement innovative institutional arrangements that allow
   a sustainable differentiation of cheese.},

Title = {Analysing the determinants of bank efficiency: the case of Italian banks},
Journal = {APPLIED ECONOMICS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {215-227},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {This study investigates the main determinants of Italian banks' cost
   efficiency over the period 1993 - 1996, by employing a Fourier-flexible
   stochastic cost frontier in order to measure X-efficiencies and
   economies of scale. Quality and riskiness of bank outputs are explicitly
   accounted for in the cost function and their impact on cost efficiency
   levels is evaluated. The results show that mean X-inefficiencies range
   between 13 and 15 per cent of total costs and they tend to decrease over
   time for all bank sizes. Economies of scale appear present and
   significant, being especially high for popular and credit co-operative
   banks. Moreover, the inclusion of risk and output quality variables in
   the cost function seems to reduce the significance of the scale economy
   estimates. Following Spong et al. ( 1995) a profitability test is
   undertaken that allows for the identification of banks that are both
   cost and profit efficient. The results suggest that the most efficient
   and profitable institutions are more able to control all aspects of
   costs, especially labour costs. Finally, the data are pooled to carry
   out a logistic regression model in order to examine bank- and
   market-specific factors that influence Italian banks' inefficiency.
   Confirming Mester (1993, 1996), inefficiencies appear to be inversely
   correlated with capital strength and positively related to the level of
   non-performing loans in the balance sheet. The analysis also shows that
   there is no clear relationship between asset size and bank efficiency.
   Finally, it is possible to infer that quoted banks seem to be on average
   more efficient than their non-quoted counterparts.},

Abstract = {This article examines the phenomenon of Instagram influencer
   ``engagement pods{''} as an emergent form of resistance that responds to
   the reconfigured working conditions of platformized cultural production.
   Engagement pods are grassroots communities that agree to mutually like,
   comment on, share, or otherwise engage with each other's posts, no
   matter the content, to game Instagram's algorithm into prioritizing the
   participants' content and show it to a broader audience. I argue that
   engagement pods represent a response to the material conditions of
   platformized cultural production on Instagram, where proprietary
   curation algorithms wrest knowledge and control of the labor process
   from producers. Cooperative algorithm hacking of this sort, although
   quite distinct from traditional organizing strategies, responds to the
   coercive force of the ``threat of invisibility{''} that necessitates
   constant data production. They represent a collective attempt to exert
   some control over their ``conditions of presence-to-others{''} and, in
   so doing, combat precarity and protect wages in the field. In a
   post-industrial economy where traditional models of labor organizing
   have struggled to address the conditions of platformized cultural work,
   I argue that the unusual phenomenon of Instagram engagement pods
   represents an organic form of worker resistance that responds to the
   unique conditions of these workers.},

Abstract = {Academics, managers, and workers often debate the merits of employee
   ownership and employee involvement in firm decisions. The recent
   popularity of employee stock ownership plans and the appointment of
   union and pension fund representatives to several corporate boards has
   renewed interest in understanding whether employee ownership can make
   firms more productive and profitable. Few studies, however, have
   compared the performance of management-run, or `'conventional,'' firms
   with worker cooperatives. Existing studies usually compare the
   productivities of firms and workers in different industries. By
   examining conventional and worker-controlled firms in the same industry,
   Craig and Pencavel provide a better comparison.
   The authors analyze data on the inputs and outputs of Northwestern U.S.
   plywood product mills from 1968 to 1986. Their data contain observations
   on conventional, union, and worker co-op firms. From these data, the
   authors try to determine whether cooperatives can produce more output
   than conventional firms that use the same level of inputs. To determine
   this, the authors must control for differences in the scale and products
   of plywood mills. The authors begin by discussing how worker ownership
   is likely to affect the use and productivity of inputs. They also
   discuss factors that affect the formation and failure of cooperatives.
   The authors hypothesize that the availability, cost, and control of
   capital play key roles in the formation and continuation of
   cooperatives.
   The authors next compare output produced per worker, output produced per
   unit of capital, and output produced per unit of timber input. They find
   that cooperatives have greater productivity per unit of timber input but
   lower labor productivity. The cooperatives also operate at larger scales
   than conventional firms. Craig and Pencavel isolate the effects of scale
   and differences in factor usage by estimating multifactor production
   functions. These production functions control for differences in input
   usage, scale, factor and product prices, and business-cycle effects.
   Their estimates suggest that cooperatives have slightly better
   productivities than conventional firms. Output supply function estimates
   reveal that cooperatives have lower output price elasticities. This
   latter finding suggests that cooperatives smooth production more than
   conventional firms when demand unexpectedly changes. In other words,
   cooperatives are less likely to reduce inputs and output when plywood
   prices fall or to expand inputs and output when prices rise.
   Craig and Pencavel conclude that worker ownership does not have
   `'first-order'' consequences for the factor productivity of plywood
   product firms. Although they find that plywood cooperatives respond
   differently to demand and supply shocks, these responses do not seem to
   have much of an effect on firm productivity. The authors conclude by
   listing factors that affect the formation and survival of cooperatives
   in this and other industries.},

Abstract = {Editor's note: The Mondragon cooperatives are located in one of the
   Basque provinces in the north of Spain. Their growth and economic
   success, from the founding of the first small producers' cooperative in
   1954, have been an astonishing accomplishment that has attracted the
   attention of researchers working on questions related to job creation,
   economic development, employee stock ownership, industrial democracy,
   and the cooperative movement. William Foote Whyte was one of the first
   researchers in the United States to analyze the functions and effects of
   Mondragon's governance structures, in a series of journal articles and
   books starting in 1977. The interest in Mondragon continues. A recent
   library search identified over 70 books and 60 journal articles
   published on different aspects of the cooperatives. This research note
   provides an update on trends in the cooperatives' economic conditions,
   employment levels, and governance structures since 1990.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The topic of gender diversity is assuming greater importance
   not only for regulatory reasons. In credit cooperative field, the
   presence of a gender diversity can qualify among the mutual aims and
   social sector should pursue. With reference to cooperative banks, the
   work aims to verify whether board gender diversity increases the
   creation of value for stakeholders, in terms of stakeholders global
   value added (shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, community
   and external environment).
   Design/methodology/approach - We propose an econometric approach based
   on OLS regression model; the econometric model adopted to test our
   research hypothesis take into account three dependent variables in order
   to measure the amount and the distribution of value created by each
   cooperative bank, like Global Value Added Index, HHI Index and GINI
   Index. Regarding the regressors in order to express the bank governance
   profile, the choice of variables is based on the results of the studies
   relating to bank governance-performance. Our model takes also into
   account other macro-economic control regressors. The model is tested on
   a sample of Italian cooperative banks.
   Originality/value - Previous studies on board gender diversity in
   cooperative banks are particularly limited as a result of limited
   information and opacity of this field. The existing studies are limited
   to analyses of the effects on performance of the separation between
   ownership and control or of the corporate and governance structures,
   neglecting the dynamics of gender diversity; recently, some authors have
   investigated the relationship between the composition of loan portfolios
   and the structure and membership of the boards of cooperative banks in
   Spain, without however considering the board gender diversity. Our work
   allows you to expand the knowledge on the issue of governance of
   cooperative banks. Our study proposes some indicators to assess the
   social and mutual performance of cooperative banks; it puts in evidence
   if board gender diversity may improve the amount and also the equity
   distribution of the value creation process to stakeholders' cooperative
   banks.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the paper may indicate possible
   best practices with respect to bank governance in bad economic times. So

Title = {Agency and institutional-related factors and the heterogeneity of
   sustainability and integrated report information disclosures in Kenya},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the factors influencing the level of
   disclosures of sustainability (SR) and integrated report (IR)
   information in a developing country context, with particular reference
   to Kenya. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a panel data set of
   419 firm-year observations of listed companies in Kenya covering the
   period 2010 through 2018. Data are collected from the annual reports and
   analysed using a generalized estimations equation model. Findings The
   results reveal that there is momentum towards newer reporting frameworks
   in Kenya with substantial IR and SR disclosures in their annual reports.
   The results also show that level of SR and IR disclosures is influenced
   by both agency-related factors (board gender diversity, audit committee
   independence, block ownership and the presence of foreign ownership).
   Additionally, institutional-related factors (regulatory pressure and
   promotional efforts of regulatory and professional bodies {[}reporting
   excellence awards]) influence the disclosures. Practical implications
   The results highlight that initiatives such as those led by the
   regulatory and professional bodies in Kenya are effective in motivating
   companies to enhance disclosures. Thus, regulators and professional
   bodies might need to continue and even intensify their efforts. These
   results have implications for further research as they show that SR and
   IR disclosures are influenced by similar factors. Social implications
   The study has the potential to contribute to the ongoing initiatives and
   discussions on the adoption of IR by firms in Africa as spearheaded by
   the African Integrated Reporting Council. Originality/value To the best
   of the knowledge, the study is, perhaps, the first to examine both SR
   and IR disclosures at the same study allowing comparison of the extent
   and drivers of the two disclosures. Moreover, examining the
   institutional-related factors in a single country has not been done in
   prior literature, and so this is an innovation.},

Abstract = {Approximately 7 per cent of the African population is affiliated to the
   cooperative movement, and in Kenya alone, cooperatives provide some two
   million employment opportunities. In Africa, as elsewhere, inequalities
   persist between women and men in terms of access to and control over
   resources and opportunities. ILO provided insight into the inequality in
   unemployment based on gender. ``In employment, women are found more
   often than men in informal and precarious work, with particularly
   pronounced imbalances in some sectors{''} (ILO, Geneva 2002). The
   critical importance of closing gender gaps - which are not only contrary
   to the realization of women's rights, but also an obstacle to poverty
   reduction - is widely recognized. The report on the State of Food and
   Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
   Nations (FAO) shows, for instance, ``that if women had the same access
   to productive resources as men, they could increase farm yields by 20-30
   per cent, raising total agricultural output in developing countries by
   2.5-4 per cent, which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people
   in the world by 12-17 per cent{''} (FAO, Rome 2011). For women, who due
   to gender-based norms often have lower access to and control over
   economic and social resources and opportunities, cooperatives present
   distinct advantages. According to Argawal, women participation in
   cooperatives has its own advantages. ``Apart from being able to access
   economies of scale as providers of services, producers or as consumers,
   participating in a cooperative as a member, elected leader or manager
   also brings with it enhanced status and voice in the community and
   society in general{''} (Argawal 2001). Given that there is insufficient
   research data on gender issues in Cooperatives, and in particular the
   participation of women in Leadership roles, KUSCCO in collaboration with
   the Cooperative University of Kenya conducted an qualitative empirical
   research that focused on co-operatives under the umbrella of the Kenya
   Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives (KUSCCO) and explored
   initiatives that KUSCCO has put in place in promoting gender integration
   in them and recommended strategies for enhancing gender balance.},
