	abstract = {How might the structure of banking affect economic resilience? We address this question by analyzing how the organizational structures of banks and banking markets were associated with unemployment trajectories in local economies during the Great Recession. Two county-level analyses yield convergent results. Increasing branch densities of giant derivative holding banks within local economies were associated with greater surges in unemployment, weaker employment recoveries and stronger recession effects on unemployment from 2007 through 2016. Increasing branch densities of community banks and credit unions and localism in banking were associated with lower unemployment spikes, stronger recoveries and dampened crisis effects. These findings advance sociological studies of finance by providing new quantitative evidence for links between the social structures of banking and economic performance. They also confound arguments that decentralized systems of small, locally based financial institutions are inherently fragile by design, suggesting instead that alternatives to 'too-big-to-fail' banking can enhance local economies' capacities to adapt proactively, withstand crisis and sustain employment during recessions.  © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Low maize yield and productivity are major contributors to Ethiopia's severe food insecurity and poverty. Generous efforts have been made by various stakeholders such as producers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations, to increase the country's maize yield and productivity. However, the outcome is not as expected to achieve food security and poverty reduction. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing the speed of adoption of the improved maize (BH-540) variety in the Central Gondar zone. A three-stage sampling method was used to select a total of 385 smallholder farmers. Moreover, a negative binomial regression was used to determine factors influencing the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. The negative binomial regression model revealed that the age of the household head, farm size, and membership of the cooperative were statistically significant and positively affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety, whereas distance to the nearest market and access to credit were statistically significant and inversely affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. Therefore, this study suggests that the native administration ought to organize skill division and provide short-range keeping fit packages to input suppliers, producers, traders, and development agents in each district. Moreover, supporting and strengthening the current agricultural cooperatives is advisable to strengthen farmer-to-farmer skill allotment by providing mindfulness conception, benefits, and numerous infrastructures. Furthermore, the trade and market development department should be designed to establish improved seed market institutions in each district. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite 2016 legalization of recreational cannabis cultivation and sale in California with the passage of Proposition 64, many cannabis businesses operate without licenses. Furthermore, federal regulations disincentivize financial institutions from banking and lending to licensed cannabis businesses. The authors explore the impact of legal cannabis business activity on California financial institutions, the barriers to banking faced by cannabis businesses, and the nontraditional sources of financing used by the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a mixed methods approach. The authors utilize call data for banks and credit unions headquartered in California and state cannabis licensing data to estimate the impact of the extensive and intensive margins of licensed cannabis activity on key banking indicators using difference-and-difference and fixed effects regressions. The qualitative data come from interviews with industry stakeholders in northern California's “Emerald Triangle” and add important context. Findings: The quantitative results show economically and statistically significant impacts of licensed cannabis activity on banking indicators, suggesting both direct and spillover effects from cannabis activity to the financial sector. However, cannabis businesses report substantial barriers to accessing basic financial services and credit, leading to nontraditional financing arrangements. Practical implications: The results suggest opportunities for cannabis businesses and financial institutions if regulations are eased and important avenues for further study. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the nascent literature on cannabis economics and the literature on banking regulation and nontraditional finance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The purpose of the article is to identify current problems of strengthening the social capital of rural territorial communities in the context of administrative and territorial reform with the definition of directions for their solution. Methodology / approach. The paper uses general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis to collect, process, and systematize the results of scientific research; abstract-logical and critical analysis – to identify possible risks due to the implementation of administrative-territorial reform; statistical – for data collection and systematization; method of comparisons – to identify the compliance of the dynamics of various forms of social capital to the potential of communities; graphic – to visualize the results of the assessment of the new spatial configuration of socio-territorial communities and the dynamics of accumulation of various forms of social capital; correlation and regression analysis – to determine the impact of certain indicators of social capital development on the economy of rural communities; induction and deduction – to substantiate the main directions of social capital development of rural communities in modern conditions. Results. Restrictions on the development of social capital accumulation have been identified, which include: shadowing of interaction and low trust in social institutions, individualization of behavioral strategies, growth of economically inactive and socially vulnerable groups, and formation of networks of discriminatory relationships, spreading of norms of destructive social behavior, as well as the risks that may arise in the new spatial configuration of socio-territorial communities. It is established that the administrative-territorial reform at the local level has created certain preconditions for strengthening the potential of horizontally and vertically integrating social capital. It was found that the dynamics of territorial identification of the population of Ukraine in relation to their community is negative and indicates low social capital at the local level. The dynamics of forms of horizontally integrating social capital of rural communities, which are represented by agricultural cooperatives, farms, and inter-community cooperation, are analyzed and it is found that the potential of their development in Ukraine has not been realized yet. The necessity of implementation of systemic decisions on the development of social capital of communities to achieve the main goals of decentralization of management is proved. The main directions of the development of social capital of rural communities are substantiated taking into account modern features of their development. Originality / scientific novelty. The specifics of the formation of social capital of rural communities as small local communities are analyzed, taking into account the main determinants of influence, which include increasing territorial mobility and maintaining the asymmetry of spatial development in the direction of the center-periphery, the choice of adaptive behavioral strategies due to changes in the territorial identification of the population and the assessment of opportunities to achieve a certain level of well-being in the community. The main directions of social capital development as a prerequisite for uniting and mobilizing internal resources for rural development are substantiated based on existing problems and identified potential risks due to the reform of local self-government and territorial organization of government. Scientific and methodological bases of research on social capital at the local level in the conditions of social and economic instability are improved. Practical value / implications. The results of the study will be useful for local governments of territorial communities formed as a result of local government reform and territorial organization of government, as well as district and regional state administrations, which focus on promoting inclusive community development and self-sufficiency. © 2022, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

Peni is one of the most developed countries in Latin America as far as the cooperative sector is concerned and an attractive one as those institutions are expected to repay very much above market rates. The value of this paper lies in evaluating whether high return rates are justified by a proportionally high credit risk, or otherwise. This research describes the characteristics of the Peruvian Saving and Credit Cooperative market and highlights the safeguarding tools used to protect their associates from credit risk. The paper uses official 2007-2018 data for all 143 Pemvian cooperatives supervised by the financial authority and applies several methodologies widely accepted by academics and practitioners to assess credit risk of the whole sector, namely a production of financial ratios, analysis of the financial statements. Beaver's model. Bathory model, Z-Score. Sprmgate analysis, Logit analysis and H-Factor model. It finds that risk in the industry compares favourably to returns, so highlighting the existence of a market anomaly. Indeed, Peruvian Saving and Credit Cooperatives offer up to two-digit passive interest rates to depositors while the corresponding risk has been computed in this paper as being comparably low.

	abstract = {In this study we test whether interest organizations that are confrontational towards EU institutions are less successful than their more cooperative counterparts in obtaining funding from the European Commission (EC). The transfer of public funds to interest organizations is a key dynamic in state-civil society relationships. Research shows that organizations, especially public groups, often heavily rely on public funds to the point that, without funds, many would cease to exist. 'Don't bite the hand that feeds you' is thus a popular expression among leaders of organizations who apply for funds. Scholars document a widespread perception among group leaders that a confrontational attitude towards the state can lead to curtail of public funds. This perception is based on the assumption that state institutions use public funding to discipline confrontational interest organizations. We test this assumption using quantitative and qualitative data collected from a survey of 270 interest organizations who applied for EC funding between 2015 and 2018. Our findings suggest that, while almost half of our survey respondents feel that critical attitudes towards the EU would have negative consequences for their funding applications, empirically, confrontational and cooperative organizations have the same chances of obtaining EC grants. This finding is robust across different interest organization categories, including when non-applicants and mortality anxiety are considered in the analysis. The results add a new layer to resource dependency theory pointing at the incongruence between an organization's perception of its relationship with public institutions and the observation of that relationship.  © },

	abstract = {Although embedded in a regulatory framework, studies suggest the important role of informal (relational) mechanisms in agricultural cooperatives, mostly viewed as complements to formal mechanisms. However, the interaction between these two mechanisms remains unclear. To improve our understanding of this interaction, we investigate governance mechanisms in agricultural machinery cooperatives, especially the “Coopératives d′Utilisation de Matériel Agricole” (CUMA). Machinery cooperatives allow producers to share machinery within a legally defined structure, but the traits of these cooperatives cause to rely heavily on informal mechanisms. This paper analyses how the interaction between formal and informal mechanisms minimizes coordination and motivation problems. Based on a multiple case study approach, the paper shows that the use of informal mechanisms results from the failure of formal mechanisms to minimize opportunism among members. As a result, CUMA members will primarily resort to informal mechanisms, using formal mechanisms as a complement when needed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The supervisory change has reduced the profitability of credit institutions and tighter supervision has been implemented. The transformation of the savings co-operative system was in fact an integration that led to the disappearance of savings co-operatives by 2019.

To take into account, the specifics of the activities of various types of financial institutions when assessing the risk of their lending, the author put forward a hypothesis about the advisability of clarifying the composition of indicators used to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. The analysis of the creditworthiness of financial companies and credit unions has been carried out. It was found that, during 2020–2021, no financial institution had the highest creditworthiness; at the same time, financial companies were more capable of meeting loan obligations than credit unions. A system of quantitative and qualitative indicators has been formed using correlation and factor analysis to assess the risk of lending to the activities of financial companies and credit unions. Certain indicators are suitable for integral assessment, and, therefore, create the basis for improving the methodological approach to assessing the risk of lending to financial institutions. © 2022 The American Risk and Insurance Association.},

	abstract = {Trade in processed small pelagic fish and informal cross-border trade (ICBT) are linked to livelihood activities in West Africa. Although these fish products are being traded informally in West Africa, research on this topic is limited. This study builds on a multi-partner supported ‘FishTrade’ initiative in Africa to illuminate the volume and value of informal fish trade across the Ghana–Togo–Benin (GTB) borders, and the socio-demographic determinants supporting participation and profitability in this trade. We used a structured survey and focus group interviews to obtain data from women fish traders, who handle the entire fish trade in three major Ghanaian markets where ICBT activities are concentrated. Our results showed ICBT across these borders constitutes significant economic and livelihood potential, estimated at about 6000 MT in volume and US$14 million in market value per annum. Furthermore, socio-demographic factors, such as fish traders’ years of experience and membership in an unofficial market cooperative, positively influence participation and profitability, but access to market information negatively affects participation. However, geographical distance, large household size and access to micro-finance negatively affect ICBT profitability. Our findings illuminate that consumers’ purchasing power, fish taste and preference, ICBT’s economic opportunities and a shared heritage and connection significantly influence this form of trading along the GTB borders. We conclude that ICBT in these small pelagic processed fish represents untapped potential for local livelihood and highlight the need for further research on this topic. © 2022, The Author(s).},

A multi-stage stratified sampling procedure was used to collect data through structured questionnaires (including both open-ended and closed questions). A sample of 561 rice farmers drawn from the Eastern and Western provinces of Rwanda was used. The study used an instrumental variable to estimate the causal impacts of women’s empowerment, and controlled for the potential endogeneity of the same. The findings of the study showed that women’s empowerment has a positive impact on rice yield and income. Overall, the study results call for policy interventions promoting female participation in financial inclusion mechanisms, farmers’ cooperatives, and agricultural production decisions. In addition, the results highlighted the importance of building strategies and mechanisms for increasing women’s control and decisions over assets. The study makes contributions to the empirical literature on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as achieving gender equality, women’s empowerment, and food security in developing countries. Future research should attempt to use nationally representative panel data to fully understand the effects of women’s empowerment on rice productivity and other income outcomes. © 2022 Asian Economic and Social Society.

Relying on a rich dataset of mainly farmers’ cooperatives, the study evaluates the socio-economic, ecological and governance outcomes of local cooperative production practices in two nature parks. Results indicate that local cooperatives modify traditional agricultural strategies to promote production systems that respect natural environmental processes and improve local competitive advantage. Their actions promote an inter-community network for conserving land and aquatic biodiversity, even though transitioning to organic production remains challenging for the cooperatives. The paper concludes that the adoption of organic production would distinguish nature parks from other biodiversity-rich local areas. As such, continuous and comprehensive policy actions from nature park authorities, such as dedicated training courses and financial incentives, are required to increase the adoption of organic production. © 2022, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

In addition, this study separately examines incentives for commercial banks and credit unions during the program. Design/methodology/approach: Using 2020 PPP loan data, the authors create a proxy for lender loan prioritization by comparing the skewness statistics of large and small loan distributions. A regression model is used to examine lender reporting incentives and loan prioritization. Findings: Results show that larger borrowers were prioritized in receiving PPP loans earlier. Lenders with financial reporting concerns and commercial banks favored large borrowers to a greater extent. Practical implications: This study may inform social planners and regulators about the benefits and costs of delegating emergency funding loan decisions to financial institutions. Originality/value: The authors believe this paper is the first to examine financial institution reporting incentives in relationship to PPP lending practices. It adds novelty by examining lender incentives, while prior research has focused heavily on the economic consequences of the program and how borrower–lender relationships affected loan practices during the program. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the coordination of the agricultural cooperative to supermarket or E‐ commerce supply chain, under the condition of quantity loss with a mixed decay function of exponential and logistical distribution. The nature of this process is analyzed, and the corresponding demand and supply functions with single‐ and multi‐stage discount strategies are constructed, respectively, to create a working model. The optimal discount ratios for supermarkets and agricultural cooperatives in decentralized and centralized decision‐making modes coupled with single‐ and multi‐stage discounts are calculated, respectively. Finally, a universal optimal strategy is designed, which can be applied to various quantity decay scenarios and makes the discount strategy more generalized. The results show that discounts can coordinate supply chains more effectively; not only would fresh agricultural produce be sold out before it starts to rot, but also the benefit conflicts arising from both supermarkets vs. cooperatives and traditional vs. E‐commerce channels could be equilibrated. Further, multi‐stage discounts are more difficult to coordinate than single‐stage ones, the corresponding optimal discount ratios rely on the initial quantity of fresh agricultural produce in the supply chain, its market share in the traditional distribution channel, the potential market size, retail price, the price sensitivity coefficient of the channel, the cross‐elasticity coefficient of prices between different channels, and the properties of the quantity loss. It is concluded that, re-gardless of what kind of quantity and quality loss occurs, whether decentralized or centralized decision making is selected, or whether the supermarket’s or agricultural cooperative’s discount ratio is considered, a universal price discount consisting of a fixed term and a drift term could both max-imize supply chain profit and coordinate this dual‐channel supply chain. © 2022 by the author.

	abstract = {This study investigated the effects of voluntary cooperativisationas conducted by the Community-Based Dairy Veterinary Foundation (CDVF) on the livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers. An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80%) and high gains (50.20%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers’ improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The paper used random sampling technique to select respondents and questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents. Cross-sectional data collected from 98 rice processors were analysed using descriptive statistics and multivariate probit regression model. The results indicated that majority of the rice processors perceived prolonged dry season and increased rainfall intensity as the main climate risks in the state. Livelihood diversification, storing of paddy, and reliance on climate information were the major adaptation strategies used by the rice processors to manage the climate risks. The main determinants of climate change adaptation strategies of rice processors were education, membership of cooperative societies, income, training on rice processing and climate risk management, experience of climate hazards, and ownership of assets. The processors faced various barriers to adoption which are mainly related to capital needs, competition from foreign brands, access to basic infrastructure and roads and information, high cost of labour. It is recommended that government support be given to the rice producing communities in terms of basic infrastructure and policies to protect the industry. Also, regular workshops/trainings should be held to train processors on best climate risk management practices and encourage registration of processor cooperatives/relevant associations. © 2022 Robert Ugochukwu Onyeneke et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study was to establish the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for the primary Agricultural Marketing Co-operatives Societies (AMCOS) at Rombo District in Tanzania. Specifically, the study aimed to establish factors that members perceive to be critical to their success, and to assess their contribution to the AMCOS performance. The study identified factors through intensive literature review, then refining them before testing them through survey to members and employed survey by distributing 334 questionnaires to members to the AMCOS that have the autonomy to do business directly without dependingon their umbrella institutions. Qualitative data were also used in order to validate the quantitative data. Data from survey were analysed by factor analysis in order to have factors which were mostly accepted by the AMCOS members. After categorising the factors obtained from the factor analysis, regression analysis was conducted to assess their influence on the performance. Qualitative data were analysed using content Analysis by the help of ATLAS Software. The study established Eleven (11) CSFs that were categorised into: commitment (use of personal skills, members’ control and promotion), governance (measurement system, governance structure, leadership support, and transparency), strategy (self-evaluation, objective development, strategy focused, living the vision of the institution). The study found the CSFs to have positive significant influence on the primary AMCOS performance. The study concludes that members of the primary AMCOS do have their common factors which they believe to be key for the success of their institutions, that affect positively the performance of their cooperatives. The study recommends that, the CSFs suggested by the members should be given priority in any decision that is intended to affect the cooperatives that can be easily translated according to their expectations to have strong institutions. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Human societies that were most efficient were primarily cooperative rather than competitive. The Vinča culture in Neolithic Old Europe is one more documented peaceful and egalitarian cooperative society in history. Vinča was the largest inhabited settlement in Old Europe and the entire Neolithic culture was named after it. The successful trade in Neolithic Europe was probably motivated by the spiritual components of the value of the goddess figurine products. The author argues that along with trade and agriculture, the main driver of the development of Neolithic society and Vinča culture was the authentic type of leadership. There was no privileged position or distinct status for leaders. The leadership was based on responsibilities, the leader was responsible to put the acquired knowledge in the service of the development of the whole community. Undoubtedly, the leadership expressed in the Vinča culture is one of the main reasons for its peaceful progress. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This study examines the relationships between cooperative board diversity (i.e., value and functional) and three performance variables (social performance, operational performance, and democratic performance). Additionally, we hypothesize that conflict (task or relational) mediates these relationships. We argue that decision making, policy, and performance depend on the composition of a board. The empirical analysis, using a sample of 423 female board members in 66 local consumer cooperatives in South Korea, finds that board value diversity can have a negative effect on performance, even though their functional background diversity may be positive, while conflicts over performing tasks may mediate functional background diversity and performance. More specifically, the results indicate that board value diversity is positive and significantly related to relational conflicts, while functional background diversity is negative and significantly related to task conflicts. The findings suggest that performance of cooperatives can be improved with more diverse board with functional backgrounds. We hope that this paper could offer a significant contribution to both the board and corporate governance literature and the diversity literature. © The authors, 2022.},

Therefore, monitoring and even predicting future changes in creditworthiness is of value to cooperative managers and their lenders. However, we know little about farmer cooperatives' credit profiles and behavior because their financial statements are seldom shared. Using a Moody's credit rating model and a unique data set, this article estimates Markov chains to evaluate changes in farmer cooperatives’ credit quality. The unconditional (one-size-fits-all) probability matrix, as is typically estimated, is shown to not be appropriate in describing credit rating transitions. Results also show cooperatives do not exhibit rating change momentum since a downgrade is not likely to be followed by another downgrade in the next period. Credit ratings of farmer cooperatives with less than $20 million in net sales follow a first-order Markov chain with stationary probabilities and the cooperatives with net sales of more than $250 million follow a zero-order Markov chain. This article adds to the limited research available on the credit rating behavior of farmer cooperatives. Cooperative managers, directors, and lenders can utilize these findings to make more informed decisions to impact future credit ratings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

On average, we find evidence consistent with credit unions managing earnings downward via the loan loss provision in the quarters leading up to and surrounding the congressional hearing. In addition, we find that credit unions with higher earnings before the loan loss provision engaged in more downward earnings management than credit unions with lower earnings before provision. Our findings contribute to the literature examining the use of downward earnings management to avoid political scrutiny and the banking literature.

This article reports on the recent experiences of joint cropland management (JCM) in Spain. These initiatives are based on the grouping of plots to achieve different objectives through social and organisational innovation. JCM involves three types of actor: landowners, cooperatives and the people who cultivate the land, who may or may not be landowners or members of the cooperative. Implementation of this strategy, which is being adopted by an increasing number of agri-food marketing cooperatives, requires substantial social capital. Therefore, collaboration between public and private actors is needed to generate and transfer knowledge on these initiatives. The Operational Group on Social Innovation in Land Management (GO_InnoLand) was created in 2020 to support JCM processes, which help young farmers who are setting up in the agricultural sector. JCM initiatives could be one way to prevent the abandonment of small-scale land plots and drive the demographic challenge. Public policies can support this strategy by enhancing social and organisational innovation, facilitating financial instruments, providing technical assistance, improving collaboration networks and linking landholders with new professionals. © 2022 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists.},

	abstract = {The partnerships between agricultural cooperatives and development actors play a critical role in meeting development challenges and building cooperative sustainability. The objective of this study was to analyze the key characteristics of engagements established between agricultural cooperatives and other actors and determine their success level. An analytical framework was developed to highlight nine areas, namely partnership configuration, stakeholders, objectives of the partnerships, partnership types, partnership stages, communication methods, achieved outcomes, partnership evaluation, and partnership sustainability. The targets were all agricultural cooperatives building associations with other actors between 2016 and 2020 in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the study covered 69 partnerships founded by 32 agricultural cooperatives. The results revealed that the cooperatives involved in partnerships essentially provide farming inputs and equipment for their stakeholders and capacity building and training purposes. The public sector was the leading actor that collaborated with agricultural cooperatives in inter-sector partnerships. The findings also showed that 55.1% of the partnerships were "strategic partnerships"in cases of both independent value formation and integrative partnerships. By focusing on mapping the partnerships, this study presents beneficial information for policy-makers working on how agricultural cooperatives dealt with the other actors and the lessons gathered to build future sustainability collaborations.  © 2022 Alotaibi, Kassem.

Design/methodology/approach – A survey was carried out of 100 managers of agribusiness cooperatives in the dairy sector in the southern region of Brazil. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was applied to the data collected. Findings – The results partially confirmed the propositions established in the study. Different combinations of belief systems, limits, diagnostic control, and interactive control were observed depending on whether the cooperative adopted defender or prospector strategic behaviors. Control of the cooperative’s strategy is achieved by combining the MCSs, since their strength lies in their joint use and their complementarity. Practical & social implications of research – The combined use of rigid and flexible controls allows agro-industrial cooperatives to simultaneously target operational efficiency and the pursuit of innovation. Originality/value – By demonstrating that not all MCSs are individually relevant to different strategic behaviors, with evidence of equifinality in MCS combinations, the study provides an original contribution. © FECAP.},

	abstract = {The recently emerged Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has affected all sections of human society including agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and industry. In this research, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 on Iran’s livestock and meat market by using an equilibrium displacement model. The prevalence of the Coronavirus has had the greatest economic effects on rising exchange rates and has reduced exports in Iran. The results also show that the factors of the Coronavirus (exchange rate and exports) have the highest effect on Iran’s meat market. The rising exchange rates and reduced exports lead to higher prices and lower quantities in the meat market, which increase the suppliers’ welfare at the retail and farm levels. These results show the negative effect of the outbreak of Coronavirus. Corona outbreak increases price at the farm and retail level, therefore, farm and retail quantities fall. Since the impact of an increase in the price is much greater than the effect of reducing production, producer surplus increases. A policy conclusion of this research is that the current situation in Iran is difficult for the poultry and livestock industry because of the need for foreign currency and the abuse of market power in the distribution system. Farmer cooperatives can overcome these problems because their objectives are to serve farmers and their goals align with farmers goals. © 2022, Tarbiat Modares University. All rights reserved.},

Drawing upon qualitative and statistical analysis, this study examines the establishment of credit unions across indigenous villages in Taiwan, where both of these traditional authority structures are present. The analysis shows that villages characterized by ascribed power and inherited hierarchy (chief villages) provide less structural support for the founding and operation of credit unions and are less likely to adopt credit unions than communities whose leadership is determined by individual merits and achievement (big man villages). This finding suggests that existing authority structures in these traditional societies constrain incentive schemes and trust structures critical to the founding and persistence of new economic organizations. © 2022 Editions Ophrys.

	abstract = {The development of agricultural cooperation in Ukraine is one of the main vectors for rapid recovery of agricultural production after the Russian-Ukrainian war, increasing its competitiveness, ensuring sustainable development of rural areas, increasing employment and welfare of rural population. However, agricultural service cooperatives are not developed in Ukraine. The purpose of this study was to find the main drivers of agricultural service cooperatives’ development in Ukraine, to outline on this basis promising directions for development of agricultural policy in terms of stimulating their development as a counterweight to the dominance of agricultural holdings. It is proven that the main restraining factor in the development of agricultural service cooperatives in Ukraine is institutional memory of a peasant, which was formed during collectivization in Soviet times and which in modern conditions is associated with the concept of “cooperative”. This creates opposition from agricultural producers towards the national policy on the development of agricultural cooperatives, which meet international cooperative principles, and which have proven their advantages in increasing competitiveness of farmers on the example of developed countries of the world. It is emphasized that before changing formal institutions through legislation, it is necessary to form proper informal institutions that will strengthen, and not oppose, the introduction of formal ones. This paper is of practical importance for scientists and representatives of public administration in the field of forming strategic state and regional programs for agricultural development. Compliance of national policy measures according to the identified drivers of agricultural service cooperation’ development, requires further research. Copyright © The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Sustainable forest management is the key to biodiversity conservation, flow of resources and climate change mitigation. We assessed the impact of various forest management regimes (FMRs): legal felling series [(reserve forest (RF), demarcated protected forest (DPF), un-demarcated protected forest (UPF), co-operative society forest (CSF) and un-classed forest (UF)] on biodiversity conservations and carbon storage in Acacia catechu Willd. Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in Nurpur Forest Division of north-western Himalaya, India. The study revealed significant variations in floristic composition, biodiversity indices, population structure and C storage potential among different forest management regimes. The RF and DPF were found to be rich in species diversity and richness whereas the Simpson dominance index for trees and shrubs was maximum in UF and UPF, respectively. The diversity of understory herbs were higher in CSF and UF. The maximum density of seedlings, saplings and poles were recorded in RF followed by DPF and UPF, whereas the minimum density was found in CSF. The tree C density (69.15 Mg C ha−1) was maximum in UF closely followed by RF; whereas the minimum was recorded in CSF (33.27 Mg C ha−1). The soil C density was maximum in RF (115.49 Mg C ha−1) and minimum in CSF (90.28 Mg C ha−1). Similarly, the maximum total ecosystem C density was recorded in RF (183.52 Mg C ha−1) followed by DPF (166.61 Mg C ha−1) and minimum in CSF (126.05 Mg C ha−1). Overall, UF management regimes were shown to have a greater capacity for C storage in vegetation, whereas strict FMRs, such as RF and DPF, were found to be more diverse and have a higher soil and ecosystem carbon density. The study established that in the midst of climate and biodiversity emergencies, it is urgent to maintain, protect and strengthen the network of RF and DPF FMRs for biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation and mitigation.

Using nationally representative panel data from Tanzania, I find that educational investment suffers because of income shocks. On a whole, I find that income shock is negatively correlated with educational investment measured in per school-age child educational expenditure. However, I find no strong evidence to suggest that self-help groups and SACCOs buffer against income shocks. This suggests that locally available buffering mechanisms such as self-help groups and SACCOs do not necessarily help households to cushion against income shocks partly because many of the shocks affect most people in a given locality. Therefore, relying solely on the local mitigating mechanisms may not be a good option. This calls for a need to design policies that would enable households to insure themselves beyond their local insurance mechanisms. Public insurance and social safety nets programs may help households to overcome income shocks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Institute for Social and Economic Change.},

However, studies on the efficacy of audit committees as governance tools in a niche area relating to social enterprises namely cooperative societies in Malaysia is still scarce. Hence, this study intends to investigate the association between audit committee attributes namely audit committee expertise and experience, audit committee meeting frequency and audit committee size to the timeliness reporting compliance among Malaysian cooperative societies. Using qualitative research methods, 158 usable questionnaires from 59 cooperative societies were successfully gathered and analysed using SmartPLS 3 Version 3.2.8. The results obtained provided support to the notion that there is a significant positive relationship between the frequency of meetings on the timeliness reporting compliance and a significant positive relationship between audit committee size on the timeliness reporting compliance. However, the notion expecting a significant positive relationship between the expertise of the audit committee on the timeliness reporting compliance proved to be insignificant. Conclusively, the study provides theoretical and practical support to both literature and practitioners on the importance of having optimum audit committee size and high frequency of meeting in ensuring the timeliness compliance of financial reporting of cooperative societies. © 2022, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw.

However, the cooperative movement is changing this phenomenon, and has attracted the attention of national government and international donors to support the re-establishment of new farmers’ groups. Using cross-sectional data collected from 37 cooperatives, this paper analyses the factors influencing the success of donor supported agricultural cooperatives by ordinal logistic regression model. The results indicate that new groups are rather small but homogeneous. Members agreed that more non-economic, rather than economic, benefits are currently derived from collective action. Determinants of success include the size of the cooperative, the proportion of women in the cooperative, the proportion of nuclear families, active participation in the cooperative and the type of product cultivated. However, the results are conditioned by respective value chain and influenced by the strategies of non-governmental organizations during the establishment of cooperatives. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

	abstract = {The aim of this article was to investigate the effects of informal controls on psychological empowerment and job satisfaction. Despite previous studies having analyzed the role of certain management control systems in individual results, such as psychological empowerment and job satisfaction, the evidence on informal controls within this context is inconclusive. Credit union systems play a considerable role in economic growth, regional development, and employability. We therefore explore the perception of directors and managers of business units of one of the biggest cooperative systems regarding the informal controls used. Considering that job satisfaction has a series of implications for organizations (for example in employee loyalty and job performance), it is important to understand its determinants. The literature points to the growing concern among contemporary organizations about informal controls. Various studies focus on understanding the role of these controls and their respective effects on organizational and individual behaviors. From the individual perspective, there is a need to analyze the indirect effects of management controls on individual aspects by means of psychological variables. Thus, this study provides new evidence on informal controls in organizations by exploring the intervening role of psychological empowerment and the (beneficial) effects on job satisfaction. In addition, the study provides a methodological contribution to the national research on management control by adding an analysis based on mixed methods. A survey was applied to directors and managers of business units of one of the biggest credit union systems in Brazil. The data were analyzed using a mixed methods approach: Partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Informal controls are directly and indirectly associated (via empowerment) with job satisfaction. Moreover, the findings indicate more than one solution for high job satisfaction. © 2022 Universidade de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.},

Yet, there is a lot of uncertainty whether externally supported FOs provide benefits beyond the channelling of programs. This paper uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and representative data from 4,074 Zambian households to estimate FO impacts on members, with and without controlling for a national input-subsidy program. The results show that Zambian FOs tend to attract better-educated households with larger farm sizes, but can lead to female integration when external subsidies are involved. FOs also have a significantly positive effect on members’ farm performance, irrespective of whether members receive input subsidies, while the presence of the external program leads to an unequal distribution of benefits within the FOs: positive impacts on farm performance are, on average 13–44% lower amongst members who do not benefit from the Zambian government program. Overall, these findings imply that Zambian FOs seem to provide benefits that go beyond the intention of the subsidy-program, which can be used to promote women empowerment and smallholder farm performance. The findings also demonstrate, however, that governments need to carefully design their programs to not reinforce inequality amongst farmer organizations and their members. © 2021 The Authors.

The uncertainty of the subjective and imprecise assessments derived from estimated data that represent the analyzed criteria characterizes the decision-making process. To reduce the uncertainties related to IT project priority setting, we proposed a model based on a hybrid multicriteria method composed by the best–worst method to establish the weights of the criteria and fuzzy-TOPSIS to define the project ranking. The model allows us (1) to define strategic subcriteria, (2) adjust the weights according to the company's reality, (3) to deal with the uncertainties of the evaluations of the decision makers, and (4) provide the project ranking that translates reality into the distribution of resources in the IT sector. Finally, we applied the model to a case study in the IT sector of a Brazilian agroindustrial cooperative. For the managers, the method provides a precise decision aiding tool. Although the model has been applied to the prioritization of IT projects in a cooperative, the same can be generalized to the IT sectors of other companies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Farmer-controlled cooperatives contribute significantly to the growth of the rice sector in the Philippines, the country’s most important agricultural sector. Despite ongoing financial support from various government agencies, many of the country’s rice cooperatives struggle to remain viable. Cooperative failure is often attributed to poor management, inadequate capital, and opportunistic side selling by members. However, a growing body of literature views these problems as symptoms of much more fundamental flaws in the institutional arrangements that characterize traditional cooperatives. Relationships between indicators of financial performance and institutional attributes observed in case studies of four Philippine rice farmer cooperatives were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of this analysis were interpreted against causal relationships predicted by the New Institutional Economics theory. Financial performance improves when cooperatives require their members to invest in proportion to their patronage, allow members to adjust their shareholding, and periodically redeem members’ shares. Other performance-enhancing institutional arrangements could be adopted if the Philippine Cooperative Code authorized directors to issue class B shares. The findings also highlight operational and governance practices that improve financial performance, which directors can and should apply. © 2022, Asian Economic and Social Society.

Such cooperatives make a trade-off between the return on investment in quality and members’ disengagement from the cooperative. Based on data from the five-year survey of small French agricultural cooperatives, we analyse the effect of incentive payments on small cooperatives’ performances. We investigate how incentive payments can reduce the problem of free riders and improve these cooperatives’ reputation. Using a quantile regression method, while controlling for the potential endogeneity of incentive payments, we show that quality-based compensation can rule out cooperative members’ defrauding options. This remuneration has a non-linear positive effect on small cooperatives’ performances. The results suggest that incentive payments improve small cooperatives’ performances. © 2021 The Agricultural Economics Society.},

The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) showed that Can Tho province was the most vulnerable to climate change, followed by Dong Thap and Tien Giang provinces. In particular, the social index sub-indicator showed high vulnerability. The beta regression analysis identified seventeen significant factors influencing the susceptibility of rice farming households in the study area, such as weather information, flood occurrence, drought occurrence, access to extension services, access to credit, and cooperative membership as well as demographic variables and livelihoods related factors. The LVI result suggests the need for the government to consider raising the priority on households in Can Tho province through adaptation support to improve the resilience and adaptive capacity, especially by enhancing the social network in this area to stimulate support from local authorities and farmer groups. The regression results imply that extension services should provide adequate and timely weather information to equip the farmers to be more prepared for climatic shocks. Moreover, credit facilities with low interest rates should be made available, especially to those who are members of agricultural cooperatives. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

	abstract = {Banana is an essential commercial fruit for smallholder farmers in East Africa including Ethiopia. It is also lifeblood of the majority of the farmers in Arba Minch district of Ethiopia. However, this sector is experiencing many constraints with limited investment on sustainable value chain management. Thus, this study aims to examine the sustainability performance assessment of the banana value chain by comparing and analyzing 25 attributes through triple bottom-line indicators. The critical aspects of the qualitative data were analyzed using Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems version 3.0 at Ethiopian context. The results show that banana product flow from the farmer and ends with the consumer through three market channels which link farmers directly with rural retailers, traveling traders, and farmer cooperatives. Largest volume of banana was sold through the traveling trader channel while the smallest volume was sold via the rural retailer channels. The banana payment flow begins from consumers and ends with input suppliers. Farmers have limited access to alternative markets for their banana products, but wholesalers have many connections and marketing options across the country. The results of the banana value chain sustainability assessment also reveal that the economic, social, and environmental indicators have moderate sustainability performance in the study area. The value of the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.7993 which shows that the five-point scale items of the experts’ judgment on the sustainability of banana value chain are consistent and reliable. The chain has several advantages in terms of profitability, emission of air pollutants, employment, and constraints in terms of coordination, profit margin, value share, market diversity, transportation, product and market information, safety and hygiene, and waste management. Thus, Government and non-governmental organizations give due attention towards the sustainable banana value chain. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Correspondingly, they are pooling products to quality-differentiated markets and offering quality-differentiated prices to farmers in multiple stages. Methodology/results: We propose a two-stage stochastic program to study the quality coordination problem in a setting where a co-op specifies a quality standard and offers a multistage payment scheme in its contract with multiple farmers who can exert quality-related effort and also show preference toward prompt payment timing. We first analyze a commonly adopted payment scheme, the pooling payment scheme, and then propose an improved payment scheme, the upfront incentive (UI) payment scheme. We find that the pooling payment scheme is able to coordinate the supply chain only when farmers’ time preference is higher than a threshold; otherwise, the scheme leads to the problem of over-motivation with respect to effort. However, the UI payment scheme can coordinate the supply chain unconditionally and is also robust to farmers heterogeneous in farm size. We further conduct two extensions, including farmers heterogeneous in farm size and dynamic market size. Managerial implications: The results provide guidance on a co-op’s contract design, including quality provision and payment mechanisms in multiple periods. © 2022 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Generally, agricultural production involves several challenges. In the drylands, it is further complicated by weather-related risks and resource degradation. In this paper, we present a case study of the mixed crop-livestock production system in Jordan. To better capture the nature of response farming in the drylands, we develop a methodology for using crop simulation models to directly generate data for optimizing production practices of an integrated crop-livestock producing household in a dynamic stochastic context. The approach optimizes producer’s adaptations to random events, such as weather, which are realized throughout the planning horizon. To ensure the sustainability of the optimized production decisions, long-term valuations of end of horizon soil attributes are included in the objective function. This approach endogenizes the tradeoff between short-and long-run productivity. Model results show that due to the limited natural resource endowments and financial liquidity constraints of the typical farm households in the study area, we find these households have limited options. To optimally respond to weather conditions during the production season, better manage risk, and achieve improvements in soil attributes, a typical household would need larger farm size, larger flock, and better financial liquidity than it currently commands. Like all such models, the farm household model used in this paper is not suitable for drawing policy implications. Therefore, targeted analysis using appropriate sectoral or economy-wide models will be needed in the future to identify and test the efficacy of different policy and institutional interventions including land consolidation, establishment of producer and marketing cooperatives, access to financial services including agricultural credit, and crop insurance in expanding the resource base of farmers—thereby positioning them for higher earnings, ensuring soil conservation, and enhancing the sustainability of the production system.

	abstract = {Farmers’ cooperatives play an important role in enabling small farmers to integrate into modern agriculture. Based on the survey data of 7200 farmers in four provinces of China, this paper uses the multi-dimensional poverty measurement method and the instrumental variable method to reveal the transmission mechanism and multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect of farmers’ cooperatives in deep poverty-stricken areas in China to realize joint agricultural empowerment through the supply chain. The results show that farmers’ cooperatives play an important role in enhancing small farmers’ financing, technology application, market sales, and rights decision-making. Every increase in the degree of interest connection between the two will help farmers reduce the multi-dimensional poverty level by 12.3%, and the mitigation effects on material poverty, ability poverty, and rights poverty are between 10% and 13%. Compared with agricultural cooperatives with weak organizational service capacity, cooperatives with high organizational service capacity have a more significant multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect on farmers, which leads to farmers obtaining financing and improving their ability and income. In addition, the difference in benefit coupling between agricultural cooperatives and farmers of different leading bodies also results in the heterogeneity of multi-dimensional poverty alleviation effects of farmers. To a certain extent, the supply chain is affected by the risk endowment of members, the supply chain’s poverty alleviation performance is affected by members’ supply chain’s poverty alleviation performance, and there is a certain risk transfer and “distribution failure”. Therefore, optimizing the benefit coupling structure and risk sharing mechanism between farmers’ cooperatives and farmers has become an important way to break the pattern of “the strong are always strong” and “distribution failure” for supply chain members and farmers. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate if access to local branch infrastructure of the farm credit system institutions (FCS), banks and credit unions (BCU), and alternative financial services (AFS) providers is related to the use of credit from non-traditional lenders (NTLs). The focus is on beginning and women operators who are typically credit constrained and thus more likely to suffer from closures of bank branches and consolidation of traditional agricultural lenders. Design/methodology/approach: Informed by Detragiache et al. (2000), the authors specify farmers’ use of loans as a function of their access to credit (measured by the branch density of each lender type) along with operator’s and operation’s controls. The measures of loans by NTLs (number, use, share and lender type) require the use of Poisson, Probit, Tobit and Multinomial Logit techniques. This study utilizes individual producer data from the 2018 Agricultural Resource Management Survey and 2018 county-level branch density data for FCS, BCU and AFS providers. Findings: Access to credit from FCS is helpful to BFRs only, while access to AFS is associated with the use of loans from NTLs by women but not by BFRs. As expected, access to BCU credit matters for the use of loans from NTLs, with a complementary effect for BFRs but a substitution effect for women’s use of such loans. Originality/value: There are no studies on local agricultural credit markets in the US that evaluate the implications from changes in access to credit on credit-constrained borrowers and their use of NTLs’ credit. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper builds an evaluation model of rural development pressure and left-behind to analyze the spatial differences and characteristics of rural development pressure and the “three-stay” problem in Jinchang City, Hexi Corridor, China, in 2019. Then, we explored the relationship between them. The conclusions are: (1) Jinchang City has the lowest pressure on infrastructure and the largest pressure on industrial development, with significant spatial differences in comprehensive pressure. (2) Jinchang City is dominated by double pressure villages (40.60%) and comprehensive pressure villages (38.35%). Single-pressure villages (19.55%) and non-pressure villages (1.50%) account for relatively small proportions. (3) The population of “three-stay” in Jinchang City is 1,642, accounting for 1.19% of the total rural population. The middle and low-level left-behind areas have the largest number, accounting for 76.69% of the total administrative villages. The types of left-behind villages are mainly dominated by left-behind children and left-behind elderly people, accounting for 71.72% of the total number of left-behind villages. (4) Homestead per household, the rate of network coverage, per capita cultivated land area, and the number of specialized farmer cooperatives owned are the main factors affecting different types of left-behind villages, and each factor has different effects on different types of left-behind villages. This paper can provide a theoretical basis for implementing the rural revitalization strategy and scientifically solving the rural “three-stay” problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Precision farming innovations are designed to improve the efficiency of agricultural activities via minimal initial input of material and human resources and avoiding harmful effects on the environment on one hand and automatizing the production on another hand, thus providing environmental, social and economic benefits. In the article, the tendencies in the adoption of precision agriculture technologies (PAT) in Ukraine were observed, with a specific focus on cooperatives as a valuable tool of social and solidarity economy helping to achieve progress in local rural development. On the example of cooperatives, applying a technology acceptance model (TAM) has identified how the adoption of new smart farming tools influence their behavior in implementing technological innovations. The results of the study will be of particular interest to representatives of other cooperatives and to agribusiness players engaged in agriculture or software development. In addition, the outputs will be useful for researchers in the field of the socio-economic development of territories and the impact of new technologies on it, as well as for local governments and higher-level government officials, which can contribute to the implementation of better rural development strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

We present research conducted through site visits, participant observation, focus groups, and surveys of communities affiliated with the Delta EATS public school garden program currently operating in three Mississippi public elementary schools. Our findings demonstrate low levels of food sovereignty but high levels of agency and ingenuity in accessing and obtaining desired foods, along with abundant interest in preserving and passing on traditional foodways. Community members express the desire to exert greater local control over food production, distribution, and consumption through community gardens, farmers markets, and cooking and food preservation classes. While food sovereignty is constrained by the current agri-food system of the Delta, programs such as Delta EATS and farmers cooperatives are enhancing local food sovereignty through farm-to-school programs that strengthen relationships between farmers and the community. © 2022 by the Authors.},

The credit-reporting platform promises to produce new and valuable knowledge about borrowers' creditworthiness and risk. But valuable in what ways and for whom? Private credit bureaus rely on vast arrays of personal and financial data in order to produce credit reports and consumer credit scores that claim to represent the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. Cooperative loan officers, instead, understand creditworthiness to be highly variable and rely on relational metrics in order to determine risk as well as carefully overseeing existing loans to ensure their timely repayment. Based on ethnographic fieldwork with loan officers at a small-scale credit cooperative in Lomé, Togo, this article examines how the impending arrival of a private credit bureau and new credit-reporting technologies highlights the distinction between the ways in which credit bureaus and loan officers understand the nature of financial risk, as well as the centrality of loan officers and their management of borrower debt in sustaining the field of small-scale lending in Togo.  © },

	abstract = {Biopesticides have been recognized as viable alternatives to chemical pesticides in controlling agricultural pests for plants and reducing harmful chemical residues. However, small and marginal farmers are facing challenges while adopting biopesticides, namely, high cost and complicated application techniques, resulting in a low level of farmer acceptance. Accordingly, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), voluntarily formed by farmers, develop mutual technical assistance among their members to solve the technical problems of biopesticide adoption. This study assumes that as a new form of farmer cooperative, FPOs have the potential to promote biopesticide adoption through the implementation of collective pesticide adoption (CPA). Along this line, this paper uses a cooperative game-based hybrid method to develop an incentive mechanism of biopesticide adoption for FPOs to implement CPAs. First, we construct a CPA decision model for mixed pesticides (i.e., biopesticides and chemical pesticides) based on multichoice goal programming (MCGP) to compromise the conflicting objectives regarding cost efficiency and chemical residue reduction, thereby obtaining the optimal total cost of pesticide adoption. Second, recognizing the optimal total adoption cost as a baseline, we devise a cooperative game-based cost allocation scheme to maintain farmers' voluntary participation in FPOs. This study demonstrates that the CPA implemented based on our proposed models can at least match if not surpass the economic and environmental performance of farmers' independent pesticide adoption (IPA). We further demonstrate that the proposed cooperative game solution is more suitable for the FPO's cost allocation issue than the eminent solutions, such as the Shapley value. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The results indicate that the overall profit of the supply chain obtained by pricing agricultural products through a decentralized decision-making model is lower than that created under centralized decision-making.

To what extent do U.S. credit unions follow cooperative principles, reflect the cooperative identity, and distinguish themselves from other financial institutions? As credit unions grow and diversify their membership, many argue that credit unions will lose their cooperative identity and become more akin to their counterparts in the for-profit banking sector. This paper presents evidence that U.S. credit unions continue to differentiate themselves from other forms of banks. In their governance structure, credit unions rely on volunteer directors and CEOs are significantly less incentivized by performance-based compensation relative to commercial bank CEOs. Moreover, 51 % of credit union CEOs are female versus only 3% of CEOs at similarly sized community banks. Credit unions also offer better interest rates, provide higher quality loans, avoid overly risky lending practices (e.g., subprime mortgages), and are more likely to open and retain branches in low-income and diverse areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wheat and rapeseed are significant crops in Czech agriculture and remote sensing has huge potential for their management, given Sentinel-1 can overcome issues of cloudiness and monitor vegetation development via radar backscatter. This study compares radar and optical data characterizing the development of wheat and rapeseed in an agricultural cooperative in the Czech Republic. Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series of the main vegetation seasons between 2015 and 2018 are processed, analysed, and compared with each other. In 2018, the comparison of data with ground measurement by camera was also used. The temporal development of RVI is affected by noise, which is caused by the composition of imagery from different Relative orbits. The separation of imagery according to the Relative orbit used seemed to provide results more comparable to the phenological curve. Simple linear regression between NDVI and RVI illustrated that considering Relative orbit can slightly increase the Coefficient of determination. By selecting a suitable Relative orbit, the coefficient of determination between NDVI and RVI increased from 0.281 to 0.387 in the case of wheat and from 0.233 to 0.316 in the case of rape monitoring. The RVI for rapeseed and the height of canopy correlation was 0.392. The results for RVI presented in this article demonstrated that monitoring wheat and rapeseed development by Sentinel-1 has potential, however more research needs to be conducted in the areas of spatial and temporal noise removal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Energy use rates are continuously growing with an increasing population. Rising energy needs then accelerate the depletion of fossil fuels. To ensure a sustainable future, renewable energy sources should be used worldwide. With the initiation of the industrial revolution, humankind started to use the world's energy resources without thinking about nature and future generations. Excessive consumption of available resources polluted the environment and altered climate patterns. Depleting fossil fuels in the near future and climate change will force world countries to tend to renewable energy sources. The present research was conducted to investigate the renewable energy awareness and adaptation of managers of agricultural development cooperatives composed of farmers, the most vulnerable segment of society to climate change. With the questionnaires, data were gathered about the general status of agricultural cooperatives, the socio-economic status of cooperative managers, managers' level of knowledge, and awareness of renewable energy resources. Survey data were subjected to fuzzy pairwise comparison and chi-square tests. Present findings revealed that cooperative managers had a medium level of knowledge on renewable energy. In addition, the cooperatives were willing to use and invest in renewable energy. This finding may guide policymakers in renewable energy investment decision-making. © 2022 University of Kuwait.

About 80 million rural Indian households are engaged in milk production with a very high proportion being landless, small and marginal farmers. The study aims to analyse the challenges faced by the dairy industry in generating employment and expanding their business. The paper has taken data from annual survey of industries over 20 years and a case study with a detailed interview of a cooperative society working in the dairy sector. The analysis is based on autoregressive distributed lag model. With the help of analysis, the study found that the dairy industry has the potential to generate employment. During the interaction for the case study, it was observed that firms in the dairy industry undertake the production of value-added products to yield profits which is limited due to low investments. However, the lack of advertisements of these products results in restrained sales and limits income of the farmers. Therefore, the study suggests that the private sector should be encouraged through product link incentive scheme and the government should intervene as a facilitator for their growth and expansion on international levels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Society of Labour Economics.},

	abstract = {The use of EU-approved pesticides is low in Ondo State, especially among smallholder cocoa farmers. Perhaps, trade credit, being one of the most important sources of credit, would increase the use of EU-approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers. Therefore, this study investigated access to trade credit and its impact on the use of EU-approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers in Ondo State. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 240 smallholder cocoa farmers for the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a double hurdle regression model, and an endogenous switching probit regression model. The descriptive results showed that on average, respondents were 44 years of age, 16 years of farming experience, 7 people for household size, and 2.70 hectares for farm size. Most of the respondents obtain trade credit from their respective farmers' cooperatives (82%), while others obtain trade credit from input suppliers (73%) and cocoa exporters (66%). It was also noted that only 35% (84/240) of the smallholder cocoa farmers use EU-approved pesticides on their cocoa farms. A majority (73.4%) of the respondents used the Ridomin 66WP gold (Cuprous Oxide + metalaxyl-M). Others use Esiom 150SL (Acetamiprid) (37.5%), Funguran-OH (Copper hydroxide) (49.1%), touch down fort (Glyphosate) (47.5%), and Actara 25WG (Thiamethoxan) (25%). The result further showed that age, gender, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and assets significantly influenced the probability of a farmer receiving trade credit. However, gender, household size, year of farming experience, cooperative membership, and assets are statistically significant in determining the amount of trade credit obtained by the farmers. The first stage of the ESPM revealed that gender, age, household size, farm size, and cooperative membership significantly influence the smallholder cocoa farmers' access to trade credit. While the second stage of the ESPM revealed that significant use of EU-approved pesticides among users of trade credit is affected by age, household size, education, access to extension services, and cooperative membership. Meanwhile, among non-users of trade credit, variables such as age, farming experience, farm size, land ownership, and cooperative membership significantly affect the use of EU-approved pesticides. After controlling for observed and unobserved covariates, the study concluded that access to trade credit positively impacts the use of EU- approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers. It was concluded that policy strategies aimed at increasing the use of EU-approved pesticides among small cocoa farmers should take into account trade credit. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Complementarily, it analyzes the interaction of organizational risk management in the relationship between cooperative behavior and knowledge sharing. Theoretical framework – The research is based on the literature on cooperative behavior, organizational risk management, and knowledge sharing with variables derived from previous literature. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted with strategic level managers in Brazilian agricultural cooperatives, with the sample being composed of 104 valid responses. To test the hypotheses, the structural equation modeling technique was applied. Findings – The results show that cooperative behavior positively and significantly influences risk management and knowledge sharing; however, no statistical significance was found in the relationship between risk management and knowledge sharing. This indicates that higher levels of cooperative behavior are reflected in greater risk management, which helps to mitigate risks, and in greater knowledge sharing in the cooperatives studied. Practical & social implications of research – It presents new information relating to cooperative behavior and risk management in knowledge sharing in cooperatives that integrate strategic alliances. As practical implications, it is highlighted that knowledge sharing should not be perceived as an immediate risk, but as being inherent to cooperation and collaboration between parties. Originality/value – It contributes to the literature by presenting new implications of cooperative behavior and risk management, perceived as enablers of knowledge sharing. © FECAP.},

Despite the appearance of altruism, the move marked the emergence of the U.S. anticolonial empire, a form that advocated racial and ethnic self-determination even as it expanded the U.S. military presence. This article shows how U.S. policymakers in Okinawa borrowed from modernization theory to implement models to foster ethnic identification through economic development. Their plans sought to render the United States an ally to Okinawa freedom despite the devastating effects militarism had on the local landscape. Specifically, military plans posited frameworks like the Okinawan economy, which strategically turned the military into a partner without whom Okinawa could not modernize. The article further focuses on agriculture, an arena where the contradictions of the U.S. Occupation was most acute. It argues that rehabilitating the local cooperative network drew Okinawans into the military project, not only to paper over the U.S. colonial presence, but also to further the reach of military discipline. © 2022 by the Pacific Coast Branch, American Historical Association.

	abstract = {Organising smallholder farmers into groups or co-operatives is widely promoted as a strategy to connect farmers to markets and turn them into price makers rather than price takers. This pathway usually combines co-operative organisational models, based on collective ownership and representation in internal governance, with measures to shorten the agri-food chain, shifting the ownership of intermediary sourcing, aggregating and trading functions to the group. The underlying assumption is that this improves smallholder farmers' terms of inclusion in markets. To scrutinise this assumption, our study compares two examples of farmer-led auctions facilitating trading in the chilli market in Java, Indonesia. The auctions' ownership, management and performance evolved differently: one was run by a group and the other by a family. The comparison brings nuance to the prevalent emphasis on co-operative ownership structures. By researching practices central to collective trading at the chilli supplier–trader interface, this study unravels four dimensions—ownership, voice, reward and risk—capturing smallholder chilli farmers' terms of inclusion in both the auctions and the market. Our comparative analysis suggests that shared ownership and control of the trading function, a central feature of co-operative models, does not necessarily ensure favourable terms of inclusion for smallholder farmers with little capacity to take risks. The capacity to reconfigure the terms of market inclusion for vulnerable smallholder farmers involves direct payment modalities and risk taking. A collectively owned trading organisation does not necessarily imply an inclusive business concept when the organisation cannot acquire sufficient working capital to pay its suppliers. © 2022, The Author(s).},

It happens because the more the organisation acquires and disseminates stakeholder intelligence, the more it will be aware of the needs of different stakeholder groups, bending the decision making towards less powerful stakeholders and creating social performance. At the same time, more stakeholder intelligence is a strategic resource to be exploited favouring the economic performance. Moreover, it is proposed this effect is mediated by social motivations. Design/methodology/approach: In all, 251 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives were sampled and a survey primary data collection method was applied. To test our hypothesis, the partial least squares structural equation modelling method is used. Findings: It is found that SO positively influences social and economic performances. Social motivation mediates the relationship between SO and social performance. Originality/value: Social performance has gained importance because strategies harmful to society are not acceptable anymore and because of the link with economic performance.

The critical factor deciding whether migrant farmers commit such acts is the degree of their spontaneous solidarity.

Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the impact of farmland rights and land transfer on access, demand, and amount of agricultural loan under the socialist system of China. For this purpose, data from China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) were used to empirically analyze the objectives of the study using various econometric approaches particularly, the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method and Benchmark regression. Results depicted that farmland rights and land transfer-in positively and significantly impacted access, demand, and amount of loan. However, the land transfer-out reduced the demand for agricultural loan. Moreover, the land transfer-in found a positive mediating impact on access, demand, and amount of agricultural loan. While the negative mediating effect of the land transfer-out was only reflected in the access and demand for agricultural loan. The farm output of the previous year significantly and positively impacted availing the agricultural loan. While the age of farmers significantly and negatively impacted on availing the agricultural loan. The results also confirmed the regional differences regarding the impact of farmland rights and land transfer-out on availing the agricultural loan. Findings of the study suggest public authorities to increase capital input through state-owned farm assets to reduce the funding gaps and promote agro-environmental sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

One primary governance issue relates to the legal form used to perform microfinance activities. The sector deploys various forms including Banks, Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Cooperatives and NGOs, but each of them has unique features that lead to different orders of priorities and to distinct structures and mechanisms to pursue such a dual objective. This study compares the board governance model and the performance of cooperative organizations (COOPs) with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in microfinance. Using data on 352 rated microfinance institutions, the test results show that, compared to NGOs, COOPs have larger boards and a higher number of board meetings. However, NGOs have a greater percentage of international board members. The test on performance reveals that, whereas COOPs are more cost-efficient and charge lower interest rates, NGOs generally perform better in terms of social performance. However, the two organizational types do not perform differently in terms of profitability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

While these cooperatives have been widely successful in boosting agricultural commercialization among rural smallholders in China, their potential has not yet been recognized in the African context. To fill this gap, we present and discuss a theoretical framework based on recent literature, an in-depth case study from Uganda and quantitative analyses of data on horticultural cooperatives from Senegal and agricultural and livestock cooperatives from Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Rwanda and Kenya. We uncover the existence of cooperatives built on land sharing schemes in different parts of Africa and especially in Rwanda. We find that these LSCs are more likely to mobilize collective marketing and have a higher business-membership ratio than traditional cooperatives, and we derive a few implications for policymaking. © 2021 Edgard Milhaud Foundation},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper was to identify the determinants of patronage of agricultural insurance in Delta north agricultural zone, Delta State Nigeria. Material and Methods: A multistage sampling technique was used to select 120 respondents. Data were obtained through questionnaire administration. Descriptive statistics, logit model, and t-test were employed in the study. Results: The findings showed that the mean age was 48 years with 59.2% of female farmers. About 60% of them had secondary education with a mean farm size of 2.10 ha. The mean farming experience was 11 years with 75% of the farmers not belonging to a cooperative society with a mean income of N80, 278.33. The major risks were pests, high temperature, variation in yield, flood and the least were a fire outbreak. Only 39.2% of the farmers are aware of agricultural insurance. The logit model showed that the age of farmers, educational level, premium rate, farm size, accessibility to credit, gender, awareness, and land tenure influenced farmers' decision to patronize agricultural insurance. Conclusion: This study examines insurance patronage by highlighting the interaction between the socioeconomic factors of farmers and the decision to patronize insurance. As far as this study is concerned, the identified factors will significantly improve patronage and increase productivity. © 2022 Agriculture Faculty of Ege University},

Theoretical framework: The study absorbed previous studies and expert opinions to determine the member' satisfaction coming to high-tech agricultural cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data was collected through a direct survey of 395 members participating in high-tech agricultural cooperatives. Then, the study uses the method of partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis and assess the satisfaction level of the members. Finding: The research results show that the factors affecting the satisfaction of cooperative members include 7 factors: working environment, trust, managers, level of participation, perceived benefits, support policies, and service capacity. Research, Practical & Social Implication: Based on the results of this study, several solutions to improve the current association activities with the role of the cooperative model as the core are proposed. People are encouraged to participate more in the association by improving the management skills of cooperatives, strengthening support activities, creating jobs, and raising incomes for people. Originality/value: Members' satisfaction will promote the activities of linking production and consumption with the main role of the cooperative, not just stopping at the immediate propaganda activities. Since then, these activities also improve people's confidence when participating in the association. Specifically, collective economic development must come from the needs of the people and participating organizations. Copyright © 2022 by Animal Bioscience.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the financial condition and ability of farmer cooperatives to withstand significant increases in bad debt expense. Design/methodology/approach: A unique data set of farmer cooperative financial statements that spans from 1996 to 2019 is used to examine the changes in profitability, solvency, liquidity and accounts receivable risk. Also, a deterministic stress test model is designed to shock bad debt expense and the resulting write-off of accounts receivable for farmer cooperatives. The stress test provides insights to the resiliency of farmer cooperatives. Findings: Results find that farmer cooperatives are in a strong financial position, which has improved over time. The majority of farmer cooperatives are able to absorb a substantial increase in bad debt expense because of their sizable, retained earnings position. However, cooperatives that have significant profitability challenges do experience much larger losses, especially mixed farmer cooperatives (roughly equally amounts of grain and farm supply sales) and large cooperatives with more than $500 million in sales. Practical implications: The stress test results suggest farmer cooperative managers and boards of directors could re-examine their credit policies and consider extending additional credit. Also, cooperatives should consider monitoring and identifying an optimal accounts receivable to retained earnings ratio, which is similar to how banks examine their tier 1 capital ratios. Originality/value: The value of this study is having data that allows for the examination of the financial condition of farmer cooperatives over time. Also, having current data means the accounts receivable stress test results are more relevant and timelier. This is important because these accounts receivable are primarily tied to crop input supplies, and farmer cooperatives are a significant market participant in the crop input supply market. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We first provide descriptive evidence of depositor discipline in credit unions: shares and deposits as well as savings interest rates react to variables that reflect the financial health of the credit union and its asset risk. We show that this discipline is long-lasting and that it is mediated by the existence of a deposit guarantee scheme and by the strength of the relationship of members with the credit union. We then use proxies of the capability of members to process financial information to show that discipline is heavily influenced by member financial sophistication. Our results suggest that a type of market-based discipline acts as a complement for regulation in controlling credit union risk taking, thus contributing to overall financial stability. © 2021 The Authors.

Thematic analysis was used to extract significant patterns from the interview transcripts. The findings indicated the themes of catalyst factors, namely, members’ support, internal commitment and cooperation, obeying rules and maintaining good reputation with the responsible authority, the management team's integrity and the management's determination to achieve the desired objective(s). Meanwhile, the constraint factors for cooperative performance include high-risk avoidance amongst cooperative board members, disagreement amongst board members, market competition and uncertainty of the fresh fruit bunch produce.

In this paper we explored the literature to develop a conceptual framework to determine how primary industry co-operatives (such as in agriculture and aquaculture) can play a role in managing natural capital. The conceptual framework developed shows that members of co-operatives have roles to act within their organisation that utilise natural capital. Acting out these roles may see the co-operative become pro-active in governing its natural capital based on economic and social goals which are guided by the co-operative principles and values. Working with the financial services sector, co-operatives would be able to engage with their members to educate and share knowledge on strategies to manage and/or mitigate the risk of natural capital depletion. This can be managed through farm management techniques and financial instruments such as credit and insurance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

However, they are not used in a standardized way by all managers, that is, they are used in some sectors and not in others.

	abstract = {Drawing on a historical study of the Walloon dairy cooperatives, this paper analyses how complex cooperative dynamics define lock-ins in their trajectories. We consider cooperatives as firms active on markets and as structures of collective action gathering farmers-members around common strategic goals. Williamson's framework from New Institutional Economics accounts for the embeddedness of firms' strategies and governance in their wider context of development. Under the influence of this context of development, Ostrom's IAD (Institutional Analysis and Development) and SES (Social-Ecological Systems) frameworks, merged in a so-called CIS framework, capture the dynamic interplay between the components of cooperatives. Resorting to a combination between these frameworks, this paper discusses how the interplay between the components of the cooperatives' social-ecological system unfolded in the trajectories of the Walloon dairy cooperatives over the last sixty years. We uncover a double social dilemma at play. On the part of the farmers, the social dilemma anchors itself in the tension between their short-term interests as milk supplier over those of principal investor. On the part of the cooperatives' directors, the social dilemma anchors itself in the features of linking and bridging social capital in the region, unfavourable to inter-cooperative dialogue. In the Walloon Region, these social dilemma constituted a structural driver of the competition between dairy cooperatives and the subsequent inability to cooperate and invest towards successful long-term diversification pathways. We discuss how contextual factors, in particular market features, regulatory frameworks, socio-political features, and institutional support to dialogue, may aggravate, or conversely mitigate the effect of these social dilemma on cooperatives' trajectories. We call for more historically-informed studies on the impact of context on cooperative dynamics and stress the relevance of contextualized approaches to unlock prospective dynamics of collective agency in transition pathways. © 2022 The Authors},

The barriers in the adoption and implementation of circular economy principles are examined within a framework. Design/methodology/approach: Fuzzy best-worst method is used to calculate the weights of barriers and identify the prioritization of barriers to circularity within cooperative supply chain. Findings: “Insufficient implementation of circular economy laws” was found as the most important barrier, followed by “Lack of information”, “Ineffective recycling policies”, “Lack of awareness for circular economy”, “Remanufacturing is a labor-intensive procedure”, “Inconsistent price policies in sources and products”, “Lack of environmental management system”, “Cost of implementation for green activities” and “Lack of R&D capability” barriers, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The number of participant professionals limits the conclusions of the study and reaching more general conclusions. A comprehensive research can be conducted by the participation of a greater number of professionals. Originality/value: Several studies analyzed the barriers to circularity; however, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has been taken an approach for barriers to circularity for cooperatives or cooperative supply chains. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The research design was survey method and a network consisting of agricultural cooperatives has been defined as the core of the network. The statistical population of the study included managers of cooperatives which were administrated by the “Ministry of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare” and the “Rural Cooperative Organization” of the Alborz Province (N = 540). From this target population, 176 managers of cooperatives were selected by multi-stage cluster sampling. A questionnaire was developed to determine the technical, economical, educational, legal, social, and policy making mechanisms that presented the collaborative networking model. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by experts in the field of Agricultural cooperative. To calculate the reliability coefficient of the questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which is used for multi-scale questions, was used. The mean of Cronbach's alpha coefficients in this study was 0.803. The results showed that policy making with a coefficient of 0.539, economic with a coefficient of 0.499, legal with a coefficient of 0.208, and educational mechanisms with a coefficient of 0.130 had the most impact, while technical and social mechanisms had no role in developing the collaborative networking. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Five years after the implementation of the tourism precision poverty alleviation strategy, how effective it has been in alleviating poverty remains to be tested. This study, through a study of 241 farm households in 10 national tourism poverty alleviation key villages in the Qinba Mountain region of Hanzhong, southern Shaanxi, finds that rural tourism has contributed to a general increase in farm household income, but the effect of income increase varies significantly between households that have escaped poverty and non-poor households, and there is no significant difference in income between those who participate in tourism and those who do not. The study concludes that the poverty-reducing effects of tourism are conditional, with the poor quality of human capital being the main obstacle to farm households’ income growth, the institutional mechanism for tourism participation is inadequate, effective farm household tourism participation is significantly low, and non-farm work constitutes a substitute for farm households’ tourism livelihood options. The primary stage tourism scenic spots have a limited role in driving the income of farming households, and the geographical location limits the effective participation of farming households. Accordingly, the following countermeasures are proposed: (1) in terms of strategic decision-making options, establish a screening mechanism for tourism participation in poverty alleviation and implement diversified poverty governance; (2) in terms of tourism development strategies, encourage the integration of multiple industries and synergistic development, realize the two-way interaction of “+ tourism” and “tourism +”; (3) in terms of development methods, adhere to the participatory development path, improve the institutional mechanism for tourism participation, stimulate the endogenous motivation of farmers, and explore the dynamic participation path of “bottom-up”. (4) In the development of endogenous power, strengthen skills training, improve the comprehensive quality of farmers and their participation level and ability; (5) In the coordination and protection, play the coordinating and leading role of grass-roots party building, and continuously cultivate and strengthen tourism cooperative organizations. © 2022 by the authors.

The cases are selected from the United Kingdom and China, representing different cultural and legislation contexts, to explore the role of culture and legislation in formulating the governance of farmer cooperatives. The results demonstrate that: (1) the formation of member groups due to considerable member heterogeneity may lead to the skewed allocation of control rights and income rights; (2) legislation play an important role in formulating the governance of cooperatives; and (3) national culture potentially has influence on cooperative governance, but direct evidence is in insufficient. © 2022 Liang et al.},

The results show that the economic crisis of the 1980s forced a change in the economic model and cooperatives were relegated from public policies. The relationship with the State fractured again in 2013 when cooperative companies were accused of fraudulent operations to avoid paying federal taxes, as a consequence, special taxation regimes were eliminated and public financing was reduced. However, the information published by the country’s administrative authorities does not provide evidence to ensure that in the last 11 years the cooperative organizations have constituted a risk factor for federal public finances and the labor stability of workers. This research applies a mixed method, which means the combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods and techniques. In the first case, the hypothetical-deductive method is used, and in the second, grounded theory and hermeneutic triangulation.

Therefore, the level of risk of participation of bank and non-bank financial intermediaries in such schemes is assessed as high. The lack of a practical methodology for assessing the development trajectory of financial intermediaries raises the question of the need for preventive control and quality modeling of their growth dynamics. The study aims to identify and formalize the patterns of development paths of banking and non-banking financial intermediaries based on the Harrington desirability function, which will be used to identify risk patterns as indicative patterns of financial intermediaries' participation in shadow schemes. The sample includes 13 banking institutions, 3 credit unions, 3 pawnshops, 3 insurance companies, and 3 financial companies. The obtained results showed the relationship between the financial intermediary risk level in terms of its participation in shadow schemes and the phases of the economic cycle as a catalyst for the economic dynamics of the formal and informal economy. Thus, in 2012-2015, most financial intermediaries were in the zone of most significant risk, especially banks, characterized by economic, social, and political instability. Today, banks are in the group with a controlled level of risk of participation in scheme operations. Over the years analyzed, a stable neutral level of risk of participation in shadow schemes was inherent in most non-bank financial institutions. They were less sensitive than banks to the phases of the economic cycle. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives. All rights reserved.},

Following the logic that they are motivated by the expectations of members and directors, this study associates these transformations with the banking services rates offered by credit unions. We employ ordered and multinomial logit models to investigate whether abnormal positive bank spreads—reflecting rates that could offer few advantages to members and large private benefits to directors—increase the probability of transformation. Our results indicate that the expectations of members and directors explain credit unions’ transformation, as seen in size and performance. The evidence reinforces that, under expectations of gains, members and directors play an active role in the decision to transform the ownership structure of credit unions, suggesting improvements in the corporate governance and incentives for mergers so that credit unions can grow to benefit members. © 2022 FUCAPE Business School.

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the decision-making factors that influence the generational succession of young members or children of members of agricultural cooperatives in the grain, meat, and dairy segments in the southern region of Brazil. First, 25 factors that influence the process of generational succession, called decision-making factors, were identified through a literature review and dialogue with the cooperatives. Then, using the methodology adapted from Slack, Chambers and Johnston (2007), a sample of 308 young people between 18 and 30 years old evaluated the level of importance and performance of the decision-making factors indicated. In the respondents’ opinion, none of the 25 factors performed better than their importance, as all factors present the possibility of improvement. However, according to the evaluation methodology used in this paper, 20 factors (property size; access to technologies; access to media and information; labor availability; diversification of agricultural activities; income provided by agricultural activities; access to education; social interaction and number of people in the community; professional expectations; remuneration received by the youth; education; type of work performed; marriage; autonomy; family dialogue; encouragement and recognition; technical assistance; presence of the cooperative, union, and associations; and access to marketing) performed adequately and did not require improvements in any of the three cooperatives. On the other hand, five factors need improvement: leisure infrastructure; road infrastructure; social valorization; rural credit and public policies; and price, according to the grain cooperative; leisure infrastructure, road infrastructure, social valorization; and price, according to the dairy cooperative; and social valorization and price, according to meat cooperative. We concluded that a significant part of the factors (80 %) performed in an adequate way directly or indirectly in the three cooperatives. The youth of the three cooperatives indicated social valorization and price among the factors that need improvement. Thus, we highlight that agricultural cooperatives should seek to understand their role in the face of decision-making factors that need improvement and seek to improve them. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In particular, this paper examines the case of a little-known deposit insurance scheme run by credit unions in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that has operated without once incurring a deficit for 70 years despite offering the kind of unlimited deposit insurance frowned upon by policymakers. We find that the provincial government played an important role in constituting the scheme and helping it operate, effectively, as a polycentric commons that until recently, satisfied all the design principles that tend to characterize successful collective management. The resulting argument is simple: it would be difficult to understand the stability of Saskatchewan’s credit union deposit insurance scheme without also understanding how government supported its operation as a commons. © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Reduction of post-harvest loses of crops are crucial tasks in ensuring food and nutrition security. However, a lack of knowledge on the extent of post-harvest losses and its associated impeding factors are posing major challenges to effectiveness of grain post-harvest loss management strategy and to scale up for all other crop types in Ethiopia. The study estimates the magnitude of post-harvest losses of all crops and identifies its determinants. Methodology: A national-level agriculture survey data were obtained from the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Tobit model analysis techniques. Results: The analysis shows 25.81% perceived annual average post-harvest losses of crops were obtained with considerable variation across the crop types. The main factors impeding post-harvest losses of crops were households with larger adult family size, higher levels of education attendance, and wealth status, large landholding size and damage of stored crops by insect pests infestation and/or rodent feeding due to utilization of traditional storage equipments, access to extension support services, cooperative marketing membership, and being far away from both all weathered roads and near local market centers due to a higher transaction costs associated with a lack of market information, contamination, and mechanical injuries. Conclusion: Minimization of post-harvest losses of crops could be achieved through a holistic approach by providing short and long-term training on post-harvest management practices, promoting the use of post-harvest technologies, paying special attention to the institutional support systems (agriculture extension and rural credit services), strengthening the support for post-harvest handling technologies, reinforcing the existing farmer cooperative marketing, and improvements of the local market and road networking infrastructures of rural areas should be undertaken by the government in collaboration with non-government organizations. © 2022, The Author(s).},

The success of Thailand CUCs is significantly associated with their good governance practices. This study provides an overview of Thailand CUCs’ governance practices and examines the impact of governance on the performance of Thailand CUCs. The study finds Thailand CUCs’ success varies in terms of financial and social performance. The results suggest that Thailand CUCs’ performance is affected by members’ participation, the board of directors, the management team, as well as the organisations’ age and size.

At the same time, organisational and institutional dairy innovations (OIDI), including group milk sales, feed and credit access, could boost dairy supply chain efficiency. This study examined the TDI adoption determinants and the OIDI adoption intensity. Data were collected from 1146 farmers (410, 382 and 354 in the milksheds of Mukurweini Wakulima Dairy Limited [MWDL], Happy Cow Limited [HCL] and New Kenya Co-operative Creameries [NKCC], respectively) and analysed using a double hurdle model. Access to credit positively influenced the TDI adoption in the three milksheds. Adoption of TDI was influenced by hired employees, dairy records, total dairy cows and household head education. The empirical evidence from the study supports the observation that OIDI adoption intensity is influenced by income, farm size, dairy records, and dairy information access. To boost TDI adoption, the dairy development partners should link cooperative society members with agricultural credit lenders. Additionally, the dissemination of dairy information to farmers by the dairy stakeholders could spur TDI adoption, while providing dairy information and training farmers on dairy record keeping should be promoted to boost TDI and OIDI adoption. © 2022 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

However, Greek agricultural cooperatives are usually small and characterised by low levels of processing facilities, technical skills and marketing expertise. One of the most emblematic products that these coops produce is olive oil, a product of widely recognised nutritional value, unique health benefits and increasing global demand. Approximately one-quarter of the country's 300 thousand tone production comes from the island of Crete. The goal of this study was to map the olive-oil producing cooperatives of Crete and examine the extent of their inter-cooperation and the barriers they encounter. In addition to being a key cooperative principle, cooperation among cooperatives can create new sales channels, lead to significant cost reductions, better profit margins, increased bargaining power and knowledge exchange.

	abstract = {Coffee cooperatives from the Huatusco region in Mexico have played an important role in helping coffee farmers in this region maintain economic viability in the midst of the economic crisis in Mexico and the international crisis of the coffee sector over time. While this type of organization has played an important role, not all of those organizations have survived over time. Using information from interviews with leaders of five longeval coffee producer cooperatives in the Huatusco coffee region, this study aims to identify the coffee cooperatives characteristics that can explain the longevity and long-term sustainability of these organizations. Additionally, using information from interviews, we evaluated challenges that could put at risk the long-term sustainability of these associations and strategies to overcome these challenges from the cooperative leadership perspective. Findings from this study suggest that motivations behind the creation of these producer associations go beyond accessing government resources. An institutional structure where there is a democratic process behind the election of leaders, leadership positions with predefined, not long, tenure terms, and association strategies to increase member engagement could explain the longevity of these organizations. Regarding challenges the cooperatives may be facing in the future, the aging population of growers is perceived by cooperative leaders as one of the major challenges they may be facing. Increasing youth involvement in the cooperatives through training and educational activities was perceived by cooperative leaders as a strategy to overcome this challenge © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 International license},

	abstract = {Cooperatives are entities with regulatory and operational singularities that make them different from other commercial companies in the business landscape. The relations with the workers, the remuneration of the partner’s contribution and the way in which the results are distributed configure them as companies of a deep social nature, even though they also have a commercial nature. After reviewing the contents of the studies aimed at the identification of business failure prediction models, we have observed that there are still very few which address cooperative societies, despite the importance of this kind of organization in our business landscape. In addition, most of the papers follow traditional statistical methodologies. In fact, the different methodologies used in this field of research have evolved over time; and one of the newest and most innovative is Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which to the best of our knowledge has not been applied in this research area. The objective of this study is to show the usefulness of Extreme Gradient Boosting methodology, which is based on machine learning techniques, in the prediction of business failure, particularly in the field of cooperative companies. We will determine whether the algorithm is suitable for the identification of the most relevant variables that indicate situations of financial distress. Therefore, it will allow to classify a company as failed or not failed. We will also analyze whether this technique is appropriate to explain the reasons leading to this classification. We also intend to contribute to overcoming the general absence in the literature of this type of studies in this business environment and to incorporate modern techniques based on artificial intelligence. To achieve the aims of the study, a model has been estimated from a sample of non-financial cooperatives that failed in 2015, belonging to various productive sectors. To consider a company as failed, a broad definition of failure has been chosen, because it allows us to clearly distinguish between failed and non-failed companies. Thus, the failure has been identified to the legal definition of insolvency, as contemplated by the present Spanish insolvency regulation. The selection made, taking into account this condition, consisted in 56 companies that had filed insolvency proceedings in the year considered. Thereafter, they have been paired with as many non-failed ones with similar characteristics, so that the final sample has consisted of 112 companies. Since our main goal is to formulate business failure prediction models, we have focused on those variables or financial ratios that provide information on aspects of the firm’s solvency and profitability, but without forgetting the influence of the company’s debts. To these main cate gories, we have added rotation, activity and asset structure. Given the uniqueness of this kind of companies we are considering, some clarifications have been made for some of the selected financial ratios, specifically for the debt and profitability ratios. Results from the statistical study show the importance of the variables related to solvency, liquidity, debt and profitability. These variables exhibited the most contribution to detecting a situation of business failure. The model combines in an effective way the variables of long-term solvency, liquidity, activity, and debt, and achieves a 100% accuracy rate in the training sample and 86% in an independent testing sample. The results have confirmed the higher the solvency and immediate liquidity of a cooperative company the lower the probability of failure. Additionally, the higher the variable that measures the ratio value added to sales the higher the probability of failure, as financial and personnel expenses are involved in this relationship. Finally, we have observed that profitability increases when cash flow grows in proportion to the company’s assets, therefore being consistent in the sense that as a company performs better the propensity for failure is reduced by being more profitable. These results are consistent with the empirical evidence: the higher the solvency and profitability rates the lower the failure probability, and the lower the debts the lower the exposure to failure. Consequently, we understand that the applied technique is quite effective for the objectives pursued, that is, the early detection of business failure for cooperative companies. Probably the variable less easy to compare is profitability since in a cooperative the book result is not comparable with the rest of commercial companies because it does not take into account the potential benefits of their partners through prices of cooperative products and services. The resulting model, in addition to classifying cooperative as failed and non-failed, has shown its potential to identify the underlying reasons for this classification. That is, the XGBoost model algorithm provides explanations about the variable’s weights in terms of failure probability for each observation of the test sample, splitting the individual weight and the influence sign of each of the predictors. Therefore, the final model is not only about high accuracy predictions, but also leads to results that are fully interpretable—it is possible to determine the sign and the effect of each variable or financial ratio on the final prediction for each and every one of the observations. The study is intended to be of a continuity nature because we consider it would be very interesting to carry out this type of analysis again but extending it to a series of several years in order to propose a model capable of detecting failure with a few years in advance. In short, we have demonstrated that this study contributes to the literature on business failure in the cooperative sector by means of showing the utility of a new methodology (XGBoost) capable of identifying cooperatives with a high probability of failure. The results are very accurate, and their interpretation is very easy. © 2021 CIRIEC-España},

	abstract = {Scientific literature has reported that participation in agricultural cooperatives has positive effects on small farmers' preference for organic fertilisers over chemical fertilisers. However, there is limited focus on enhancing the voluntary use of organic fertilisers by small farmers who have joined an agricultural cooperative. This paper describes an agent-based model for simulating small farmers' decision-making with regard to fertiliser selection. Ninety six farmers (members) of one of the largest strawberry production cooperatives in China were assessed to understand their willingness to use different fertilisers and their socioeconomic characteristics. Simulation results showed that for farmers belonging to the agricultural cooperative who earn higher marginal profits, variations in the prices of the agricultural produce had no significant effect on their behaviour in terms of the use of organic fertilisers. The number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year has a positive relationship with the increase in the rate at which farmers use organic fertilisers. However, the count does not alter the final number of farmers who use organic fertilisers after several years. Moreover, farmers' willingness to use organic fertilisers enhances the increasing speed and final number of farmers using organic fertilisers simultaneously. The design of strategies (increasing the number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year and enhancing farmers’ willingness to use organic fertilisers) has a significant effect on the promotion of organic fertiliser application by agricultural cooperatives in China. © 2021},

	abstract = {Tobacco has been grown in Tanzania since the 1950s and remains a designated strategic export crop cultivated under contract farming arrangements. This article examines the role of primary co-operative societies (PCSs) in co-ordinating the tobacco contract farming system. The article traces the transition from public marketing boards to private sector predominance and contributes to an understanding of the dynamics of contractual arrangements between private capital and smallholder tobacco farmers. It draws primarily on data collected through in-depth interviews with tobacco-processing companies and the leaders of PCSs in Urambo district, Tanzania. The analysis shows that the PCSs that are central to this sector need to ensure that their members farm in accordance with good agricultural practices and comply with reforestation and labour practice requirements as part of the industry’s focus on corporate social responsibility programmes and the promulgation of strategies addressing social and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the PCSs have become the gatekeepers for local development projects co-funded by the Tanzanian tobacco processing companies and global cigarette brand owners. The article argues that the PCSs’ ability to capture economic benefits for local development by tapping into the tobacco value chain depends not only on PCS leadership qualifications, capabilities and their capacity to ‘align’ farmers with the required cultivation practices, but also on the bargaining capacity of the PCSs in relation to the tobacco processing companies, which is influenced by whether the supply base is reliable in both quantity and quality. Recent developments in the contract farming arrangements provide new constellations of economic dynamics and opportunities for social and economic development activities at the PCS and village levels. The article ends with a discussion of rural development outcomes based on tobacco revenues, showing how contract farming integrates local communities into the dynamics of the global tobacco value chain while simultaneously reproducing local socio-economic differentiation. © 2022 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.},

	abstract = {Policymakers in Southern Africa have long viewed agricultural cooperatives as a way to reach rural households more easily, but because not all rural households can afford to join cooperatives, this raises questions about membership inclusivity and whether cooperatives advantage some smallholders over others. Agricultural cooperatives can serve as an institutional vehicle for policymakers to deliver direct benefits to smallholder farmers in the form of subsidized agricultural inputs, usually improved seed varieties and fertilizers. They can also serve as platforms for collective action through which smallholders can reduce transportation and transaction costs or disperse the costs of marketing. In Zambia farmers are required to join a cooperative to qualify for seed and fertilizer support through the national Farmer Input Support Program (FISP), which is a structural incentive for cooperative membership and makes it complicated to determine if cooperative membership increases use of inputs and yields on its own. Using the Inverse Probability Weight Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) technique, we find Zambian smallholders participating in cooperatives achieve significantly higher maize yields and use significantly more hybrid-maize seed and fertilizers, even when controlling for FISP eligibility. Furthermore, across all selected productivity and input variables we find greater average treatment effects from cooperative membership than FISP participation. Cooperative membership is also associated with more assets, more land, and higher maize yields, which suggests that the poorest rural households are often not cooperative members. Cooperatives can be a powerful poverty policy tool to deliver direct benefits to small farmers, but not including the poorest households likely widens the rural poverty gap, both in terms of limited direct benefits of input support programs and in terms of farmers missing out on cooperative-specific benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {US credit unions have been subject to a strict regulation of their commercial lending which included both requirements for enhanced organizational practices and a cap on the proportion of business loans relative to assets (imposed in 1998 by US Congress). Since 2003, however, these limitations have been steadily relaxed, a process which has resulted in an increase in credit union business lending activity. Using data from the universe of US credit unions we provide comprehensive evidence that expansion of the business loan portfolio increases the risk of the asset side of the credit union. This is the case even for credit unions which benefit from partnership with the SBA, for which we observe an initial increase in the risk of non-SBA backed loans (an overconfidence effect) which reverses over time (a learning effect). Our results suggest, furthermore, that the risk of business loans is exacerbated for credit unions which initiate their business loan activity and which do so rapidly. In the second part of our analysis we provide descriptive and quasi-experimental evidence that expansions of credit union activity into business loans are associated with lower subsequent growth rates of deposits. This result is similar to the reaction to risk indicators found in the banking literature and might give an ex-ante incentive for the CU that could work as a market-based stabilization mechanism complementary to that of explicit regulation. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The current agricultural system in China highly depends on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Consequently, agricultural production activities cause various environmental issues. Carrying out safe production provides vital support for sustainable development of agriculture, which may improve this situation. The past decades have witnessed the fast development of rural cooperatives organization in China. Given the fact that rural cooperative organization plays a crucial role in agricultural production, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative membership and safe production of smallholders in China. This study aims to investigate whether the participation in farmer cooperatives contributes to safe production in agriculture in China. Using survey data covering 623 rice-producing farm households in Sichuan province in China, this study employs the endogenous switching regression model to examine the effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. The results show that cooperative membership has significantly positive effects on safe production in rice agriculture. In particular, the average treatment effects demonstrate that without the participation in cooperatives, the members’ adoption of the green control techniques would reduce by 74.491%, the application of artificial weeding would reduce by 38.768%, and organic fertilizer input would reduce by 23.448%. Furthermore, the marginal treatment effect is employed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. Heterogeneous effect analyses suggest that farmers who are more likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt green control technology, while farmers who are less likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt artificial weeding and increase organic fertilizer input. To improve safe production in rice agriculture, the Chinese government is expected to encourage rice farmers to participate in rural cooperative organizations, and to stimulate rice farmers to take collective action to address environment issues arising from agricultural production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

In the case of agri-food cooperatives in the olive oil producing areas of Spain, a substantial share of the business is based around the social economy, with CIRIEC reporting a cooperativization rate of 70%. As such, there are increasing opportunities for these cooperatives to adopt tools that enable the potential development of social innovation actions. In the present article, we conduct a literature review to explore the definitions of social innovation provided in the last decade. We then analyse the results relating to a proposed model of social innovation applied to the olive oil industry, involving the participation of an expert panel composed of people with a position on the board of directors or managers of olive oil cooperatives and companies in the olive oil industry. From the analysis of the data collected, we identify four dimensions of Social Innovation that are particularly relevant to the olive oil industry: the Economic Dimension, the Cultural Dimension, the Environmental Dimension, and the Technological Dimension. These dimensions give rise to a methodological model for the implementation of Social Innovation actions in the olive oil industry. © CIHEAM – Istituto Agronomico Mediterraneo di Bari.},

	abstract = {Sunflower production is an excellent choice for both local and national agribusiness with significant potential in smallholder farming systems due to low input costs, consistent yields, and a short planting window. However, farmers are faced with interrelated constraints in their sunflower production. This study was undertaken to examines the perceptions of the constraints to sunflower production as perceived by smallholder farmers in North West Province, South Africa. The research identifies some factors related to sunflower production constraints. Then, a stratified random sampling technique was used to select 172 sunflower farmers and they were asked to rate their response on these attributes on a 5-points Likert scale. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we agglomerated and condense information from the original datasets of the constraint attributes into three main components (innovation, farm finance, and crop management practice). Because of the hierarchical structure of the dataset with farmers nested within their local municipalities, we use Hierarchical Logistic Modeling techniques to identify the factors that determine farmer’s perceived interest in innovation, farm finance, and crop management practices. Innovation and farm finance emerge to be critical elements for sustainable sunflower production. The findings indicate that age, education, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and gender are strongly correlated with farmers’ perceived interest in innovation and farm finance characteristics. This study recommends that to promote these elements among smallholder farmers, it is necessary for governments at the local and national level to invest in extension service and education, cooperative organizations, research, and development in disentangling the age, gender, and farm size inequalities existing in the district sunflower production. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Recognition of co-operatives as a legitimate business model and form of economic participation was significantly challenged by the rise of neo-liberalism in the 1980s with its emphasis on individuals and markets. This fueled an externally and internally driven push to demutualize co-operatives and convert them into Investor Owned Businesses (IOB). While the international trend to demutualize emerged from the end of the Second World War, evidence indicates it accelerated from the late 1980s until the onset of the Global Financial Crisis. Drawing on an ongoing project of historical data collection and visual analysis of Australian co-operatives, this paper explores the Australian experience with demutualization, particularly with regard to agriculture. In line with the international experience, there has been a surge in Australian demutualization since the 1980s. However, while demutualization continues to be a feature of the Australian landscape post-GFC as co-operatives tackle with the changed political and economic environment, the paper also challenges the view that demutualization is inevitable for agricultural co-operatives. Co-operative managers can make strategic choices to avoid demutualization and retain member control. Further, co-operative culture and the persistence of co-operative clusters in particular regions can blunt the push to demutualize.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

In Nigeria, housing finance is through the formal and informal institutions; and personal residences accounted between 75 and 90 per cent of household wealth, that represents between 3 and 6 times their annual income. Finance is an important determinant of success and failure of housing ownership. It, therefore, becomes very necessary to identify viable sources of funding that can promote house-ownership. This paper examined the activities of Cooperative Societies in the provision of funds for house ownership in Nigeria with a focus on Akure. In the conduct of the social survey for the study; two sets of questionnaire were used. The first set of the questionnaire focused on House-owners and 683 sampled houses-owners were administered with the questionnaire in Akure. The second set of questionnaire was administered on the government officers' in-charge of the administration of the cooperative societies in Akure. The answers to the questions in the questionnaire were adequately supplied. The data were subjected to statistical analysis. The findings revealed among others that the main sources of funding house buildings were through personal savings and Cooperative Societies among others. It recommended that prospective house-owners should be encouraged to form and patronise Cooperative Societies as a reliable source for the housing loan. © 2021 The Authors},

The current circularity of the production of silk cocoons, at the farm level, is 74.19 % for material, and 0 % for energy. A range of measures are proposed, based on (i) engaging with reverse logistics practices, (ii) establishing a local agroindustrial cooperative, and (iii) building community biodigesters, which aid a potential circularity of 85.51 % (material), and 100 % (energy) at the farm level, and 98.42 % (material) and 100 % (energy), at the cooperative level. On top of increasing circular value, the proposed measures might bring environmental benefits, such as lessening environmental impacts of logistics (by valuing local resources) and replacing non-renewable energy, and social impacts, through increased quality of life for sericulturists. Economic implications need further investigation and are suggested to be addressed in future research endeavors, along with policy implications for the development of a circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, an increased circularity can also contribute to a few of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations, such as SDGs 2, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

When a cooperative's decision makers receive exogenous signals, endogenous processes concerning organizational adaptations start. Radical changes are met with resistance, such as the conversion of a traditional cooperative into an entrepreneurial cooperative (where members have individual ownership) or a farmer-controlled business (external investors participate in ownership and governance). Cooperative memberships and leaderships may have change agents who advocate for new institutions while gatekeepers try to resist them. The development of Swedish agricultural cooperatives from 1990 until 2020 illustrates this theoretical reasoning. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {A significant problem of the current land management in Slovakia is the long-term separation of usage and property rights. More than 91% of agricultural land is leased and used by larger agricultural enterprises (9%). Current common agricultural policies of the EU have been the subject of criticism for a long time, as inappropriate settings force farmers to manage unsustainably with a negative impact on biodiversity. Substantial, reliable and beneficial mutual information sharing between those who do business on the land, who own the land and who use the surrounding landscape, either as a living space for housing or relaxation and recreation might help to mitigate some issues. In this paper, the authors present an implemented proposal for multi-layer map and analytical support for land and soil use assessment. The model area includes the land units managed by the Agricultural Cooperative of Horná Nitra. The approach includes the identification of undesirable combinations according to criteria (degree of protection, area, type of use, erosion risk, and ecological stability) on each land block. This concept enabled the visualization and quantification of risks in the area in question through an online GIS application with a web interface. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

However, according to most research/literature, agricultural cooperatives fail for many reasons, including but not limited to lack of capital, incompetent management and organizational deficiencies. This study applied a qualitative analysis to the qualitative data using a case study of Zanokhanyo Food Security Cooperative (ZFSC) in Ndabakazi, Butterworth. Interviews with the project members, ex-members, extension officers and youth were conducted through a semi-structured questionnaire administered in IsiXhosa. According to the results, lack of intensive production resulting in very low incomes is one of the reasons why projects such as ZFSC fail to attract young people and provide employment for rural people. Agricultural extension advisory services play a very limited role because of their generalist approach; they lack depth of knowledge about diverse agricultural subject areas. This study recommends that agricultural extension and the farmers’ support system be improved by employing or outsourcing specialists to cater to the needs of agricultural cooperatives in order to improve the productivity and income of agricultural cooperatives. © 2021, South African Society for Agricultural Extension (SASAE).

Against this background, the e-commerce has played an important role in solving this problem. Therefore, it has once again become the focus of attention of the Chinese government and researchers. The co-operative is an important channel for Chinese farmers to sell agricultural products, and thus, it is a vital research issue to discuss whether the application of e-commerce in the co-operative is conducive to the improvement of its profitability. This study therefore uses Logit model to analyze the factors affecting the use of e-commerce in co-operatives and PSM model to calculate the impact of e-commerce on the profit margin of co-operatives. The following conclusions can thus be drawn: (1) The gender and education level of decision-makers and the degree of processing and relevant certification of products are important influencing factors, (2) e-commerce can significantly improve the profit margin of co-operatives, and (3) e-commerce plays a more significant role in improving the profit margin of co-operatives selling primary processed products. These study conclusions are based on national-level survey, and thus, the industrial policies should be formulated according to these influencing factors to support the development of e-commerce in co-operatives, especially those selling primary processed products. © Vilnius University, 2002-2021 © Brno University of Technology, 2002-2021 © University of Latvia, 2002-2021.},

	abstract = {Third sector organizations, like the rest of the economic system, have been heavily affected by the pandemic. The aim of this work is to study resilience and adaptability to crisis in terms of economic results and innovative outcomes of the cooperative business model in the Italian third sector during the COVID pandemic. This study uses new evidence from a recent survey on this sector and con-sists of two main parts. In the first, the institutionalist literature on contractual failures is assumed as an interpretative key in the comparison between the business models, gov-ernance, and routines in social cooperatives versus other non-profit organizations (NPOs) interpreted as third sector entities. In the second, we use the new data from a third sector survey in the Marche region, collected in the late spring of 2021 toward the end of lockdown measures. Empirical assumptions concern organizational resilience and adapta-tion to unexpected negative shocks in cooperatives and other NPOs. The results show that, in the management of the crisis, cooperatives are better able to preserve their human capital and resort to layoffs less often than other NPOs. Shared deci-sion-making, employee involvement, and the adaptability of the work process emerge as dominant organizational characteristics that support resilience and service innovation in cooperatives. The main policy implication concerns the ability of cooperatives to play a stabilizing and a-cyclical role during a crisis and to fill the supply gaps left open by other organizational forms (private, non-profit and the public sec-tor). The originality of this paper lies in the new approach to cooperative organizations and in the analysis of the reaction of cooperatives during the pandemic crisis. © 2021 by the authors.},

Cooperatives are a particularly viable organizational structure for these projects since Indigenous foodsystems historically depended on community cooperation and collective use of land and other resources. This paper is interested in the ways Native foodway initiatives are building producer cooperatives in the US as a method towards food sovereignty. To do so, authors conducted interviews, attended food sovereignty gatherings, and reviewed relevant literature to offer historical context, a theoretical framework for Indigenous food sovereignty producer cooperatives, and four Native-led food producer cooperative case studies that are working to increase access to fresh, local foods produced in accordance with the beliefs, behaviors, processes, and worldviews of their particular communities. The organizational structure and purpose of the four cooperatives differs, but they are united in a common commitment to stewarding the interspecies relationships foundational to Indigenous foodways. In doing so, these cooperatives are also expanding who, or what, counts as a “member.” We argue this offers a compelling model for ecologically and culturally integrated cooperative development in individual communities and a platform for (re)establishing foodways and trade relationships between Native Nations. © 2021},

	abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of this study was a theoretical and methodological generalization of the agroholdings’ social initiatives within their charitable activities with the interaction of cooperatives based on the institutional model. Methodology / approach. This study was based on applying the general economic and special methods. The abstract-logical method was used for scientific discussion and scientific views about the role of agroholdings and their impact on the rural population. The method of critical analysis was applied to outline the social aspects of agroholdings’ activities. The system approach allowed contouring the main problems that arise in the process of agroholding growing. The study of the state of agricultural cooperatives’ financing by agroholdings was also conducted. On the basis of the monographic method the motives and directions of the management of separate agroholdings within their social responsibility limits were defined. With the generalization method, the basic forms and resources of agroholdings’ social responsibility were determined. Thanks to the correlation-regression analysis, it was established the relationship between the social responsibility indicator of agroholdings and their efficiency by EBITDA, as well as their social responsibility and market capitalization degree. Results. The study examined the main scientific approaches to the role of agroholdings, which allowed outlining their ambiguity and contradictions. The systematization of the presented materials allowed developing arguments in favor of the agroholdings’ functioning and identifying counterarguments of their activities as well as emphasizing the need of the basic methodological provisions for further harmonious development of agroholding structures and cooperatives. The results of the presented empirical analysis showed a low level of agroholdings’ social responsibility, which affects the development of the rural areas and significantly increases social tensions. On the basis of the conducted research and data processing the mechanism of agroholdings’ and cooperatives’ interaction on the basis of social responsibility is offered. It was proved that the basis of the presented interaction must be financial and economic, social, marketing and environmental motives. Originality / scientific novelty. It was improved the theoretical and methodological approach to the formation of institutional model of the agroholdings’ and cooperatives’ interaction on the principles of social responsibility, which provides financial and economic, social, marketing, environmental problems solutions by agroholdings and promotes the rural community’s development in the near future. Practical value / implications. The results of the study are of great practical importance and can be useful for various ownership forms of agricultural producers as well as for agricultural holding organizations which are interested in harmonizing the rural economy development. © 2021, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

	abstract = {The collection and recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic modules is emerging as a challenge due to the dramatic growing installment of distributed PV systems worldwide. This paper studies the locational strategy for recycling facilities of end-of-life PV modules from the perspective of various stakeholders with a case in Zhejiang province, one of the leading regions in promoting distributed photovoltaic applications in China. The generation of end-of-life modules in the “Million Household Rooftop PV Project” in Zhejiang Province is estimated from 2041 to 2045. The regional reverse logistics network for collection of the retired PV modules is optimized using the Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) model. The article draws on the PV recycling scheme of PV CYCLE in Europe, and proposes the following two scenarios for comparison: (1) Scenario A: Municipal recycling, in which the local government takes the responsibility to establish the collection and recycling infrastructures; and (2) Scenario B: Producer cooperative recycling under Extended Producer Responsibility scheme, in which the PV producers use their sales and customer services network to help collecting the end-of-life PV modules. The different roles of the stakeholders affect the overall locational strategy for recycling. The result shows that: (1) Both scenarios result in similar path of the utility of recycling facilities: when only one recycling facility is needed in 2041, the recycling plant in Hangzhou will be used to minimize the overall transportation cost for the whole province; while more facilities are needed due to increasing generation of end-of-life modules in the next 4 years, regional collection centers will be assigned to the nearest recycling facility, dividing the province into three regional recycling group: “North Group (including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou)”, “South Group (including Jinhua, Lishui, and Quzhou)”, and the “Coastal Group (including Wenzhou and Taizhou)”. (2) Although the overall cost of reverse logistic in scenario B is slightly higher than scenario A at the beginning in 2041, integrating the producer's sales and service network into the collection network can significantly lower the overall reverse logistics cost up to 9.7 percent at the end of the 2043 when the waste PV generation achieves 72 thousand ton/year. The conclusion suggests the necessity to introduce the Extended Producer Responsibility principle in Chinese PV market to encourage the industry to participate in the construction of an efficient recycling system for the coming wave of end-of-life PV modules. © 2021},

Community-based livestock breeding programs (CBBPs) have emerged as a potential approach to implement breeding programs in smallholder farms. This study assesses the viability of CBBPs as a potential approach for conservation and improvement of indigenous small ruminants, using case studies of goat CBBPs in Malawi and Uganda. Data were collected using focus group discussions, personal interviews, and direct observations. The program promotes and empowers smallholders to have access to small ruminant feed resources through the protection of existing communal pasturelands, capacity building in pasture production, and conservation of crop residues and crop by-products. Implementation of the CBBP enhances the contributions through improved animal growth performance, kids’ survival, and twinning rates leading to increased offtake rates and better prices. The existence of permanently established supporting organizations and other stakeholders provides sustainable institutional support instrumental for the establishment and growth of CBBPs. However, the establishment of functional community-based institutions (producer cooperatives) and investments in institutional/policy reforms to safeguard fair trading, access to common resources by small ruminant keepers, and adoption of the CBBP model into national livestock development programs are some of the key milestones that can guarantee sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Co-operatives in Thailand have played an important role in promoting self-reliance and financial advantages for their members. However, these co-operatives have also encountered their own technical and financial performance issues. This study asks whether a co-operative’s board capital (i.e., human capital and social capital) can positively influence that co-operative’s organizational performance via the mediating role of organizational capital (i.e., structural capital and financial capital). Data were collected from 133 co-operatives in several regions in Thailand, with the population sample comprising 133 managers and 529 employees of Thai co-operative businesses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of aggregated employee data (n = 529 [board capital]) and organizational-level data (n = 133 [organizational capital and organizational performance]) provided full support for the proposed hypotheses (X2/df = 1.827, RMSEA =.079, CFI = 0.911, TLI = 0.901, SRMR = 0.053). In particular, the board capital of the co-operatives was found to positively influence organizational performance via the mediating role of organizational capital. Furthermore, the results showed that agricultural co-operatives were rated significantly lower in terms of their board capital and organizational performance in comparison to non-agricultural co-operatives. These findings highlight the importance of different types of capital and the discrepancies that exist between agricultural and non-agricultural co-operatives, which deserves further attention from researchers © 2022.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to illustrate and understand how consumers of cooperative food products could be segmented in the region of Western Greece. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was undertaken involving almost 500 consumers in the selected region. Consumers were segmented on the basis of their consumption of cooperative products and in association with their attributes and beliefs regarding cooperatives’ products. The performed cluster analysis grouped participants into four distinct groups with different characteristics and perceptions regarding cooperatives’ products. The consumer groups were called “skeptics”, “cooperative”, “passively sensitive”, and “indifferent”. According to the results, in general, participants considered cooperative food products as a safe choice with excellent value for money and contributing to the local society, economy, and sustainability. Segmentation could allow agricultural cooperatives to focus only on those segments of consumers that are willing to pay for cooperative products by allocating all available resources in serving them. The results of this research, even with its limitations, can help directors and marketing executives of agricultural cooperatives to better understand that operating in a specific market could be more effective when targeted at specific segments to help not only the viability of agricultural cooperatives but also their economic development and growth. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Global inland aquaculture continues to grow rapidly at an annual rate of 5.8%, increasing competition for other land use thereby generating sustainability concerns. Nigeria is the largest producer of African catfish, yet species-level information is completely scanty in relation to encompassing nature of environmental, social and economic values. In this study, a field survey exercise of the operations, systems and yield of Eriwe fish farm village was conducted with 74 fish farm cooperatives. The present study sought to establish the sustainability status of catfish farming in the region using proposed indicators in the existing literature. Findings revealed catfish farming in the village is economically sustainable with an annual gross margin of $44,539 and $25,868, coupled with a net income of $44,386 and $25,728 for intensive and semi-intensive systems respectively. This was further established with net present value (NPV) of $10,279 and $8323 and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 2.16 and 2.35 for both systems respectively. Both systems were found to have low labour remuneration < 0.50, which are below the recommended standard of 1. Environmental sustainability indicators revealed 100% of farmers discharged untreated wastewater directly into the river. All catfish farmers in the village contributed to the annual upgrade of road networks and security assurance. Through this study, it was revealed catfish farming is economically sustainable in the region. However, the influence of catfish farming practices on the social factors and ecological values have been given little or no attention. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.},

For this, exploratory and descriptive research was conducted, with a qualitative and quantitative approach. Quantitative data on renewable energy production, economic, and market were used for each territory. Data collection techniques were bibliographic, documentary, and field research, through interviews with the managers of family farmers’ cooperatives, containing at least one representative from each evaluated territory. As a result, it was found that the contributions of renewable energy from wind sources installed in these regions are still incipient from the perspective of cooperative managers, although they believe that the appropriation of this technology by family farming could contribute significantly to the expansion of food production and market building. © Este é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a licença Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado..

However, due largely to data limitations, we know very little about the monetary value of ownership held by members and how value changes across members of differing characteristics. Through a discrete choice experiment with more than 200 dairy farmers in the United States, we examine these issues explicitly for dairy marketing cooperatives that purchase their members’ milk and process it into finished dairy products. Results suggest that dairy farmers, on aggregate, are willing to accept lower per hundredweight compensation, 2.3% of the average milk price, to be cooperative members relative to selling to independent handlers. Results also suggest dairy farmers actively consider the industry wide impacts within pricing offers on preferences for other milk pricing attributes. The inclusion of demographic covariates highlights preferences important to understanding heterogeneous member interests and, thus, informing improved cooperative governance strategies and board decision making to address them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In addition to the production of analytical categories able to deal with the particularities of this elite, we used Brazilian legislation on cooperatives, some economic data, documents from OCEPAR and other cooperative entities, and interviews. We found that the institutional aspects of business cooperativism and the social characteristics of this entity's leaders help to explain why presidents of the largest agro-industrial cooperatives occupy the majority of the OCEPAR board constituting a channel of political power between such cooperatives and the entity and the latter with the political institutions and authorities. Therefore, we verify that some institutional and social aspects strongly impact the recruitment of this cooperative elite and the constitution of the agro-industrial cooperativism as a political actor, a dimension of great relevance for addressing its economic importance. © 2022.

Research on short life cycle products with revenuesharing contracts assume stable prices or investigate the effects of revenue-sharing contracts on supply chain coordination. This study introduced a revenue-sharing contract model into a ‘farmer-supermarket directpurchase’ supply chain, considering price fluctuation and retail promotional efforts, stochastic market demand, among other factors. Revenue-sharing contracts achieved long-term stability in supply chain coordination, all participants obtained more profits, and the size of revenue-sharing parameter depends on the position and bargaining power of all participants.

	abstract = {This study was conducted to identify the challenges of crop production and marketing in southwest Ethiopia. Primary and secondary sources of data were used. Qualitative and Quantitative data types were collected from 385 respondents through interviews, focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and observations. The collected data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and econometric models. Crop productivity was analyzed by the Cobb Douglas model and its efficiency and determinants were identified by the stochastic frontier model. The major bottlenecks of crop production were the low attitude of farmers towards improved technology, low supply and usage of improved seed varieties (94.5%), low supply and use of fertilizers (95%), knowledge and skill gap of farmers (80.1%), poor extension service (57.3%), soil acidity (94.8%), diseases and insect pest (77.8%), conflict (84.9%) and the outbreak of human diseases (60%). Marketing challenges were poor infrastructure (87.3%), lack of market linkage (62.5%), and lack of credit services (70.6%). The Cobb Douglas model result revealed that land size, local seed, improved seed, repetition of weeding, and labor force influenced crop productivity. The mean level of crop technical efficiency was 51.3%. Education level, extension service, access to credit, cooperative membership, number of livestock owned, and soil fertility were influenced crop inefficiency negatively and distance to the farm was positively related to technical inefficiency. Improving extension services and skill of farmers through practical based training and building capacity of extension workers and systems to enhance the attitude of farmers towards technology usage and proper management practices, timely provision of farm inputs, improving road and market access, and provision of credit services to producers were some of the recommendations forwarded to alleviate crop production and marketing challenges in the study areas. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Communities prosper when they are able to appropriate the wealth they produce and their institutions make peoples’ lives meaningful. They wither when the institutions that permit this weaken or vanish. Sacrifice zones — abandoned, economically shattered places, with growing social and health problems — are spreading in historically white rural areas and small towns across the United States. Rural decline, rooted in economic restructuring and financialization, causes severe stress, exacerbates racial resentment, and creates a breeding ground for regressive authoritarian politics. A multidimensional approach must analytically connect long-term and recent trends affecting economy and livelihoods, institutions, health, and community life. The “racial resentment” and “economic distress” explanations for authoritarian populism are inextricably connected. Since the 1980s, and in intensified form after the 2008 financial crisis, capital has systematically undermined the institutions — mutually-owned banks, credit unions, mom-and-pop businesses, family farms — that fostered reinvestment of locally-produced wealth, especially but not only in rural areas. While many Trump voters were affluent suburbanites, another important sector of supporters consists of downwardly mobile inhabitants of zones where financialization and austerity destroyed the institutions that earlier allowed people to appropriate the wealth that they produced and where the social safety net, always fragile, is increasingly in tatters. The United States now has a poor and near-poor majority. Scholars and the media have underestimated the human toll of this crisis and the interconnectedness of the multiple processes of social decomposition affecting rural zones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This study contributes to maintaining the business linkage model among farmers - cooperatives - enterprises in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic and quickly recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used for data analysis following an iterative process based on theoretical and empirical analyses to obtain a structural model fit and test the research hypothesis. The findings indicate that the VCI positively influenced the VCP of Chu-mango business linkages at the 1% significance level through coordination (Beta = 0.345; construct reliability (CR) = 3.272), collaboration (Beta = 0.289; CR = 3.128), and joint decision-making (Beta = 0.324; CR = 3.245). This study provides empirical data on the relationship between VCI and VCP through the Chu-mango value chain in Dong Thap Province during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness from stakeholders and encourage value chain thinking to improve performance. This result may pave the way for relevant policymakers to look for policies and strategies for better inclusiveness of stakeholders to show the importance of the VCI in improving the performance. Moreover, the study is an empirical case contributing to the agribusiness value chain in a developing country; it applies the agribusiness value chain of the tropical fruit domain and can be used for other agricultural products in other cases of unexpected risks. © 2021.

	abstract = {Major changes are taking place in the Chinese countryside. Long a smallholder dominant economy with small and fragmented farms, a suite of policies, regulations, and financial instruments are being mobilised to drive larger-scale, more commercialised, and more industrialised farming in China. Larger operators such as “dragon-head” agribusinesses are transforming production and supply chains, while the operational rights and titles over farmland are being formalised so that smallholders can more easily transfer their land to large-scale producers. This article aims to deepen our understanding of the extent and nature of land transfer in China by exploring its dynamics in inland provinces. It draws on a 2019 survey of more than 900 cash-cropping farms in four provinces (Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei and Yunnan), semi-structured interviews, and secondary data. Our mixed methods approach supports in-depth analysis of the extent and dynamics of land transfer in apple, tea, orange and coffee-growing areas. We find that in contrast to national statistics, land transfer from smallholders to other operators is generally quite limited, a finding which highlights the ongoing viability of specialised smallholder farming and other site-specific barriers to scaling up. In the site where land transfer is most extensive, it is being driven by a state-agribusiness-cooperative alliance rather than through a newly emerged rural land market. We also find that the nature of leasing out farmland is markedly different to leasing in farmland. Where it occurs, the leasing out of land tends to be organised and formalised, and is tied to state developmentalist goals, particularly poverty alleviation. The leasing in of land is more widespread and occurs on an informal basis. Our analysis highlights key conditions that determine uneven land transfer and confirms that local political-economic dynamics complicate the realisation of central government directives on the ground. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

There is evidence in the literature that inadequate communication between management and cooperative members can be one of the reasons for organizational failure. Inconsistent and ineffective communication can create a disconnect between members and organizations. In addition, communication is an important mechanism capable of improving the commitment of members to the cooperative. Despite this, agricultural cooperatives are slow to incorporate more diverse and effective means of communication to reach their varied audiences. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

Our study fills this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of property rights reform on banks’ capital adequacy in China and heterogeneity across restructured forms of ownership, reform pathways, and time. Using data from rural credit cooperatives in China for 2008–2014, we find that rural cooperative banks have better capital adequacy than banks under two other forms of ownership. We further find that among four possible reform pathways, only restructuring from a rural cooperative bank to a rural commercial bank enhances capital adequacy significantly and that improvements in capital adequacy generally weaken over time. Further analyses indicate that this improvement is primarily attributable to capital injections and removal of non-performing assets by the government. These findings contribute to an understanding of how best to reform rural finance, particularly in developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive dataset comprised of 410 paired vegetable producers in China is applied. Propensity score matching (PSM) estimation method is used to control for the selection bias problem. Findings: The empirical results indicate that contracting farming does not have significant effect on yield or profit of vegetable production, but promote producers to obtain quality certification. In comparison, cooperative membership has positive effects on the yield, profit and quality certification of producers. Additionally, cooperatives generate positive spillover effects on members' farm and non-farm income, though the results are sensitive to unobserved factors. The inclusion of spillover effects helps to find out the potential unobserved effects which are neglected by most studies and design better policies to promote the development of agricultural companies and farmer cooperatives. Originality/value: First, empirical evidence is provided for theories regarding the roles of different supply chain coordination modes on producers. Second, the analysis on evaluating the effects of supply chain coordination also considers the spillover effect on the farming of other products and even non-farm work of involved producers. Third, a unique dataset comprised of 420 paired vegetable producers, based on an extensive survey is built. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Domestic, labor‐intensive and traditional food value chains and the smallholders they serve appear to be particularly affected. During a systemic shock where idiosyncratic risk coping strategies fail, collective or organizational resilience becomes of the essence to protect the livelihoods of smallholders. In this study, we have used pre‐ and during‐shock data on agricultural cooperatives from Southeast Africa to understand how resilient these smallholder‐owned organizations are. We find that many organizations could not countervail market‐disruptions and fell into a state of dormancy during the pandemic. One reason for this is that collective decision‐making was heavily affected by the banning of gatherings. Only a few organizations devised innovative solutions to maintain the market linkages of rural smallholders. The lack of resilience demonstrated by most cooperatives appears to be associated with organizational immaturity, large membership size, elite capture and limited business‐orientation, which underscore a general lack of managerial capital. © 2021 by the authors.

However, many of the merger processes undertaken fail: some are aborted at the negotiation stage, and others are not approved by members. These failures entail financial and social costs due to frustrated expectations and the time invested in the negotiation process. The objective of this paper is to establish the economic, socio-cultural, organisational and process management factors that underlie this outcome. A survey was conducted among the directors and administrators of a sample of Spanish agri-food cooperatives that had participated in merger processes which were aborted at the negotiation stage or were not approved by their members. Factor and discriminant analyses established the aspects which had the greatest impact on the failure of the merger processes. Far from being economic factors, these analyses reveal that defensive localisms, a lack of commitment to the merger on the part of members and directors, and communication failures were more significant. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Similar to the number of agricultural cooperatives in the European Union, the number of German wine cooperatives is decreasing. The main purpose of the wine cooperatives is to support the member businesses with the highest possible payouts for their grapes. Wine cooperatives can fulfil this purpose by implementing a differentiation strategy. On the one hand, brands can be used for differentiation. On the other hand, cooperatives can use particular values in the communication with customers that correspond to the target group’s values. Based on the definition of the International Co-operative Alliance, cooperatives are a sustainable form of enterprise. Therefore, the question arises whether it is possible to use sustainability as a value that corresponds to cooperatives as a form of enterprise as well as to a strong societal value that gains importance. Which role does social capital play in the context of social sustainability? The aim of this paper is to shed light on the understanding of brands, to show which cooperative-specific characteristics might pose a challenge to cooperatives in terms of brand management and to examine the understanding of the sustainability construct as well as sustainable management practices applied by wine cooperatives to date.

	abstract = {The study assessed the perception of contract farm households about sugarcane outgrowers’ scheme around the Wonji/Shoa sugar factory. The study utilized primary data collected from randomly selected samples of 200 members of sugarcane-producing farmers’ cooperatives through a structured survey questionnaire. Purposively selected ten KIIs and six FGDs were also conducted with contract farmers and stakeholders. The five-point Likert scale measurement was created and applied to measure the perception of respondents about the scheme on considered 26 attributes and analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results revealed that the overall perception of the respondent contract farm households about the scheme was unfavorable with a weighted mean/index score of ‘2.32ʹ with a mixed perception index score on considered 26 attributes. The study discussed the policy implications of the findings. The main areas of concern are the payment system, the relationship of contract farmers with representatives (from the union, factory, and cooperatives), the income of contract farm households, the provision of services package (like free training, extension services, technical advice), the transparent and comprehensive contract terms and conditions, the provision of basic inputs and production services as per agreement (like adequate land preparation, infield irrigation), the effective and efficient legal framework system, additional support by third parties (on pre and post-harvest, production input provision, basic skill training, and etc.), and both parties should develop trust by having confidence on each other and not by acting opportunistically. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Structured abstract: Rendering digital services have taken centerstage in the current ICT for development discourse. E-Government services are mostly under this discourse with the aim to provide citizen centric services in the public domain. Business and development organizations alike are also investing in developing their own digital infrastructure for rendering services to its stakeholders. This case describes scenario in which a cooperative organization wishes to use digital infrastructure and provide digital services to its farmer members. The cooperative continued investing in ICT since the last couple of decades and constantly upgraded it to ease the transaction and bring efficiency and reduce information asymmetry. This had greatly benefitted the members. However, the cooperative is aware that its communication network built on the wireless medium has its own limitations in introducing new services and integrating its databases and applications. The cooperative took note of “Digital India (DI)” initiatives to provide digital services to rural areas and build an ecosystem to empower the citizens in its governance set up. This DI policy has implicit provisions of better networking protocols with improved bandwidth. The organization has a dilemma to continue with investing its own resources or explore possibility of piggybacking on the DI initiative. The cooperative wished to examine the total cost of ownership in either case and assess the feasibility of converging with the infrastructure created by the government. Case synopsis: The Government Information Technology Policies are increasingly favouring citizens and in favour of shared infrastructure and services. It is worth the examination to evaluate strategies to deploy IT infrastructure and services with optimized cost and better returns in an enterprise. This is far more important for a social enterprise like AMALSAD cooperative (user-owned firm) that has deployed its own IT infrastructure and ITeS. AMALSAD cooperative deployed its IT assets long back and in the meanwhile, the Government policy is in favour of providing services over the internet. Leaning objectives: The case serves to help students to understand the theoretical concept of Enterprise information systems infrastructure and services. It brings to the students understanding: the drivers of IT infrastructure to provide digital services; challenges that would make the social enterprise (in this case user-owned firm) to understand the opportunities and challenges of deploying the right digital infrastructure and get services on demand. The case presents the scenarios for the students to deliberate and find answers to the right approach for estimating the total cost of ownership (TCO). Social implications: The case situation presents a scenario for digital government services. Most of the customer-facing enterprises including social enterprises are also providing digital services. It is important that such services converge at an optimized TCO. Complexity academic level: Masters in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems.

	abstract = {Farmer companies (FCs) were a form of farmer-owned firms established in Sri Lanka during the mid-1990s. These have been facilitated by state institutions. Maximization of returns through commercial agriculture has been the main objective of FCs. However, no FCs were operating by the year 2010. This article explains that the institutional facilitation is a strong ingredient in the establishment of FCs in Sri Lanka. This article explainfs how the institutional and governance arrangements of FCs were influenced by the facilitating institutions during the institutional facilitation. It also suggests that institutional facilitation affected the performance of FCs. Six failed FCs were studied. Strategic facilitation was responsible for the performance and sustainability of FCs while operative facilitation provided the basis for direction and operations. Results indicate that poor performance and failure of FCs were due to institutional facilitation that has introduced weak institutional and governance arrangements. There was non-shareholder influence on the Boards of Directors; geographically restricted shareholding; democratic voting rights; and shareholder rights not linked to equity or patronage. Governance problems included voting by the raise of hand; managers not reporting to the Boards directly; shareholders did not elect all the directors. Institutional facilitation of FCs in Sri Lanka has been done by the state facilitating institutions. They have been excessively authoritative on their respective FCs. Therefore, changing the label from cooperatives to companies would not result in better performance. Some recommendations are that facilitating institutions empower FCs through capacity-building; participatory approach in facilitation; remove the geographical restriction in shareholding; install variable shareholding; build capacity of managerial staff; use secret ballots at voting, and practice proportional voting. Understanding the role of facilitating institutions and the dynamics of facilitation would be useful to promote farmer collectives in smallholder farmer dominant developing countries. © 2021 Association of Asia Scholars.},

	abstract = {The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable development Goals (SDG) are a universal commitment to mobilize resources, a challenge for each State to meet its own goals, a new strategy that must rule world development programs, an action plan in favor of people and the planet. They have become a new moral commitment and the map that sets the course of governments, cities, companies, organizations, and citizens in the next ten years. Five years after their launch, the perspectives for meeting these goals by 2030 are uneven. There are critical areas and favorable trends in the international sphere (United Nations, 2019; Sachs et al., 2020); in the Spanish landscape, data is not much different, and there is a need to accelerate their implementation (Castiñeira, 2019; Ruiz & García, 2019; Sánchez et al., 2020). In this context, it is relevant to have indicators to assess and measure the degree of progress of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is also necessary to communicate and make them visible to transform the SDG into an option that allows citizens to choose organizations that offer more sustainable products and services (Silos et al., 2018). Communication is much more than an informative process; it is a management process of the relations between people. When speaking about communication as a space for dialogue and participation, it is necessary to address elements such as identity, perception, and the very action of communication for proper analysis. This article contextualizes current commitment and identification with SDG of companies and organizations; it goes deep into the perceptions and knowledge of citizens of these goals and focuses on SDG communication for social economy organizations. This research’s main objective is to review the contributions of social economy organizations to SDG communication. It departs from a perspective of its development, sensitization, and the raising of awareness towards them. To reach this objective, we start with two hypotheses: The first one, social economy organizations’ communication of the SDG is scarce; the second one, SDG communication, responds to a declarative model versus a participative model. The methodology used was a documentary and content analysis of social economy organizations’ communication of the SDG in Spain. To accomplish this analysis, we examined different representative families and entities of this sector. We tracked web sites, social media sites, studies, and reports from various organizations. We paid particular attention to organizations with greater economic relevance and representation in Spain, according to CEPES (Confederación Empresarial Española de la Economía Social -Spanish Enterprise Confederation for Social Economy). In total, we analyzed social media publications, web sites, and news spaces of close to a hundred companies between January 2018 and mid-September 2020. Additionally, we analyzed activities and published news to examine how SDG and the 2030 agenda were communicated, according to the three proposed tiers in the communication model. The three levels of the communication model are: declarative, where organizations limits to commit in writing or participate in SDG related events without thoroughly implementing the development of these goals within the organization’s policies and defined strategies; informative, where the organization considers developing some of the SDG, inform and offer basic training to its employees and may even produce a report of the achievements in a registry format, and monitors and informs about its progress; and participative, were the members of the organization get involved in the implementation and become the leading prescribers and ambassadors of SDG, and also, the organization participates actively in the diffusion of SDG, with full integration within their communication channels. Finally, the article shows four social economy organization cases representing an excellent example of the communication model’s participation level. Regarding the results obtained, the majority of the hundred organizations analyzed have a web presence. However, their presence in the principal social media networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, is minimal and uneven. Similarly, only a few of the enterprises include SDG references or news on their web sites. The only ones that stand out with information on their websites are the cooperative organizations Cobadu, COPISO, Cajamar, Amiab Group, and Espriú Foundation. Out of 28 organizations associated with CEPES, eleven fluctuate between the communication model’s informative and participative tiers. The ten organizations are the very Spanish Enterprise Confederation for Social Economy (CEPES), CEPES Aragon, Catalunya Cooperative Confederation (Coopcat), Comunitat Valenciana Cooperative Confederation (Concoval), The Spanish Confederation of Consumer and User Cooperatives (Hispacoop), Agro-Alimentary Cooperatives of Spain, Mondragon, Coviran, Federation of Enterprise Associations of Inclusion Enterprises (FAEDEI), Espriú Foundation and Once. The article also analyzes four cases that show the ways a participative communication model may develop. The first case involves Gavina School in Picanya (Valencia), who developed a themed project on human rights and sustainable development goals with students aged 12 to 16 (1º to 4º ESO). Teachers, students, and parents were involved in the initiation and development of the educational project linked to the SDG; the second case also coincides with an academic project from the Sorolla Educational Group. It aimed at raising awareness and spreading the SDG. They produced an environmental project with the educative community’s participation (students, teachers, families, and service personnel). Various external stakeholders (companies and public offices) also participated; the third case involves an agricultural cooperative, Oleocampo, Cooperative Society of Andalucia. Oleocampo is an example of alignment with the 8th SDG creating quality job opportunities, commitment to biomass and edible oil tourism; and the fourth case, where Fruits de Ponent Cooperative includes all 17 SDG in their daily activities and produces sustainability reports. Web pages, social media, and sustainability reports are the main windows of communication of any organization with their context. The analysis’s practical conclusions do not show a decisive wager for SDG from Spanish Social Economic organizations. Very few of the organizations leading their sectors have a well-defined communication strategy for SDG. The cases that include references of the SDG have a communication model in the declarative tier, where the commitment barely extends to the organization’s members or towards society. Nevertheless, this does not mean that there is no concern or they are not working, but they are not communicating. Social Economy Organizations have in their origins SDG specific values, where people, context, and cooperation are fundamental. These values represent an opportunity we can not miss. It is necessary to continue communicating the SDG, communication must be action, and with a time frame of 10 years ahead, there is still much work citizens can do. Social economy organizations are better positioned to influence sustainability and SDG since they have good identity values to be the transmission belt of these goals. This research also shows the opportunity these organizations have to take the lead. It is a landscape of slow processes, where some goals lay far ahead. Social economy organizations have a chance to communicate their philosophy, values, and alignment with the SDG and the 2030 agenda. © 2021 CIRIEC-España},

We conducted a series of public goods experiments to study within-group cooperation in Malawian farmer groups. We combine results from these experiments with survey data and qualitative interviews. Our results shed light on the heterogeneous capacity of groups to cooperate. We find that democratically run groups, in particular those with close social ties, are more cooperative compared to groups with leader-driven decision-making. Focus groups indicate that this democracy is deliberative in nature, characterized by open discussion that aggregates preferences, increases common knowledge, and creates goodwill. A second set of experiments in which we experimentally vary the decision-making processes yields quantitatively similar results in arbitrary groupings of farmers and null results in pre-existing groups with established decision-making procedures, demonstrating the stickiness of institutional rules. Our results imply that group formation and functioning needs to be included in the design phase of agricultural projects in low income countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Agricultural land conversion (ALC) and agricultural land abandonment (ALA) have a direct relationship with different economic, social, and environmental issues. The change in land management and land use, in addition to economic and social effects, has a major impact on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil, quantity and quality of water resources, and air quality. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the drivers of abandoning agricultural lands in Sanandaj county in Iran using a structural equation modeling method. A systematic random sampling method was followed by a proportionate strategy for the selection of 351 samples from a total of 4500 farmers. Data were collected through a questionnaire developed during a comprehensive literature review. The results showed that the causes of ALA can be categorized into five drivers: economic, social, political, agro-technical, and managerial-legal ones. These drivers have a two-way relationship, both direct and indirect, with each other. According to the farmers' views, the most effective cause of ALA was managerial-legal with a factor loaded value of 0.79. The most important issues in the legal-managerial factor were lack of a strong and efficient land use management for lands around cities, inhibition of land fragmentation Act during the legacy after the culmination of Iran's revolution in 1978, purchasing agricultural lands around the city for housing construction purposes, the problem of segmented farms, and not paying enough attention to establish and enforce agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, better support of legal management issues about agricultural lands leads to better control of land use change (LUC). © 2021},

This article uses a survey of 6,000 households in Nepal, a developing economy, to enhance understanding of the factors driving solar-system uptake by households. A key contribution is the breadth of analysis. We find important influences for economic, social, and locational factors. In contrast, physical dwelling aspects, such as roof material, appear to be less important. Social influences explain extra variation in solar-panel uptake, when comparing social and economic influences, although some variables could be classified in multiple categories. For example, membership in a women’s saving and credit cooperative is a socioeconomic factor that is associated with greater solar-panel adoption. Socioeconomic factors may be the most important for future policy innovations, given that existing policy already focuses on location. For instance, this article finds that solar adoption has been much higher in the most supported regions for the Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {This article shows that in the years between 1937 and 1962 Aldous Huxley adopted a species of anarchism. It demonstrates, first, how in espousing gradualism and pacifism, in stressing the significance of education and meditation as agents of social change, in seeking to construct intentional communities in the here and now, as well as build on pre-existing examples of ‘anarchy in action’ such as consumer and producer cooperatives, in taking a measured view of the state, not rejecting the institution on principle, but only its coercive form, and in making sex central to his vision of utopia as an essential ingredient of a happy and sustainable life, Huxley anticipated the ‘new’ anarchism of the postwar era. Second, it argues that, in rejecting notions of ‘normal’ subjectivity, in seeing the human subject as fundamentally irrational, in viewing power as coextensive with society itself, as a relationship that can only be managed as opposed to abolished, in repudiating grand theory or metanarratives in favour of ‘micro-politics’, and in viewing science as both epistemologically flawed and potentially oppressive, Huxley anticipated postanarchism. Despite his reluctance to adopt a label, it is the contention of this article that Huxley ought to be considered a social anarchist. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The European small ruminants (i.e. sheep and goats) farming sector (ESRS) provides economic, social and environmental benefits to society, but is also one of the most vulnerable livestock sectors in Europe. This sector has diverse livestock species, breeds, production systems and products, which makes difficult to have a clear vision of its challenges through using conventional analyses. A multi-stakeholder and multi-step approach, including 90 surveys, was used to identify and assess the main challenges for the sustainability of the ESRS to prioritize actions. These challenges and actions were identified by ESRS experts including farmers, cooperatives, breeding associations, advisers and researchers of six EU countries and Turkey. From the 30 identified challenges, the most relevant were economy-related challenges such as ‘uncertainty of meat and milk prices’, ‘volatility of commodity prices’, ‘low farm income’, ‘high subsidy dependency’ and ‘uncertainty in future changes in subsidies’ resulting in ‘a sector not attractive to young farmers’. Most of these challenges were beyond the farmer's control and perceived as difficult to address. Challenges were prioritized using an index, calculated by multiplying the relevance and the feasibility to address measures. The identified challenges had a similar priority index across the whole sector with small differences across livestock species (sheep vs goats), type of products (meat vs dairy) and intensification levels (intensive vs semi-intensive vs extensive). The priorities were different, however, between socio-geographical regions (Southern vs Central Europe). Some of the top prioritized challenges were linked to aspects related to the production systems (‘low promotion of local breeds’ and ‘slow adaptability of high producing breeds’) and market practices (‘unfair trade/lack of traceability’). The majority of the priority challenges, however, were associated with a deficient knowledge or training at farm level (‘poor business management training’, ‘lack of professionalization’, ‘slow adoption of innovations’), academia (‘researchers do not address real problems’) and society as a whole (‘low consumer education in local products’, ‘low social knowledge about farming’, ‘poor recognition of farming public services’). Thus, improved collaboration among the different stakeholders across the food chain with special implication of farmers, associations of producers, academia and governments is needed to facilitate knowledge exchange and capacity building. These actions can contribute to make ESRS economically more sustainable and to adapt the production systems and policy to the current and future societal needs in a more region-contextualized framework. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of Peninsular Malaysia’s single mother co-operatives. This study mainly examines the number of active and inactive co-operatives and identifies the key factors influencing their success or failure. The research evaluated 23 co-operative groups of single mothers. The performance of the cooperatives was analysed through in-depth interviews with officers of the Malaysian Co-operative Societies Commission (MCSC). Despite the government’s financial and non-financial assistance, the findings indicate that co-operatives have not performed well. The preliminary results suggest that inactive single mother co-operatives are higher than those active ones. This study found that 61% of the total single mother co-operatives in Peninsular Malaysia are inactive (dormant and non-operational) compared to 39% active ones. Four influencing factors contribute to a higher percentage of inactive co-operatives: limited resources, dependence on subsidies and sponsors, managerial incompetency, and member participation. The results suggest solutions for the management of single mother co-operatives and provide additional information and contribution to the parties involved to empower the association to fulfil the economic, social, and cultural requirements. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of propensity score matching technique and sample selection stochastic frontier framework that addresses potential selection bias due to observable and unobservable attributes is used to estimate the effect of participation between cooperative members and non-members. Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated and compared. Findings: The empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates that cooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantly associated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, total farmland, distance to market and geographic location). Practical implications: The findings of this study demonstrate that cooperative organisations can be an important tool to enhance the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers. Successful cooperative models together with training programs designed to enlighten farmers on the importance and tangible benefits of collective action should be used to enlarge participation in cooperative organisations. In addition, governments and development agencies should implement targeted investment and capacity building programs related to irrigation management, gender-sensitive awareness and development of the internal institutional mechanisms in cooperatives for the transfer of knowledge and mutual learning so that all members benefit from cooperatives. Originality/value: Despite the pervasive evidence of the impact of cooperatives on productivity and technical efficiency in the Asian region, this study is probably the first attempt in the crop sector in Mongolia. It provides a rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency through a counterfactual design. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, rural poverty is an unresolved issue, despite farming having been a poverty coping strategy for many rural dwellers, especially after the end of the Balkan war. Eradicating poverty is among the priorities of the national government that aims at EU candidacy and accession. Being the most dynamic among agricultural sectors, berry farming is a key agricultural activity at the national level and had been the subject of rural development interventions, including the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. This article provides evidence from the largest agricultural cooperative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to inform decision making and policy planning. The article aims at describing and analyzing the status and dynamics of poverty at the farm household level while highlighting their contributing factors, as well as at proposing possible development strategies based on the voice of local actors. Given the complexity and multifaceted features of the investigated issues, the methodological approach of this study relies on a mixed-methods research design, where the quantitative findings from the analysis of poverty status and dynamics and their contributing factors are complemented by qualitative findings from participatory activities. The results of the study pinpoint the successful contribution of the cooperative to the improvement of farmers' working conditions and market access and suggest that supporting collective action among berry farmers can be an effective rural development intervention to alleviate rural poverty and prevent poverty fallouts. To date, structural characteristics of farm holdings and households and climate and market-related conditions have significantly contributed to the farmers' poverty as well as to farmers’ exposure to poverty. Furthermore, bridging the gender gap is still a challenge in Bosnia and Herzegovina which should be addressed urgently to mitigate the problem of social exclusion and to promote bottom-up innovation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Our first stage efficiency estimate by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Window model shows the average efficiency of RuSACCOs gradually increased over time. The second stage Tobit censored estimation and bootstrapped truncated regression results confirms our hypotheses for key and control variables effects on technical efficiency. Focusing on rapid expansion during the early life cycle affects technical efficiency. A high percentage of women membership in cooperative enterprises advances technical efficiency.

A prepared questionnaire was distributed in one of the Russian regions (the Republic of Tatarstan), and the collected data were analyzed via the cross tabulation method and logit analysis. According to the study results, the major reasons for not cooperating are as follows: respondent farmers lack the experience of cooperation, they have problems trusting each other, they are not socially active in their communities, and they rarely have a higher education. The study results recommend that the Ministry of Agriculture, willing to develop agricultural cooperation, pay special attention to educating farmers in terms of cooperation. Particular work should be done in teaching farmers to work in groups, trust each other, and organize systems of cooperative ventures in a way that would exclude cheating and free-riding behavior on the parts of both the cooperative members and the leaders. Stimulating social activities among farmers in rural areas might also increase cooperation. In addition, there is a need for agricultural consulting services offering high quality educational courses explaining the advantages of cooperatives and profits that they may provide to the members. © 2021.

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate the interdependence between gainsharing and performance evaluation (objective and subjective) in a credit union. There is a recent debate on the interdependence between management control practices, which emerges from the discussion of control packages or systems. This study delves into this discussion by investigating the complementarity between gainsharing (group incentive modality) and performance evaluation in a credit union context, given the need for qualitative empirical studies on this phenomenon. This study is considered relevant because the joint use of management control practices can allow organizations to effectively mitigate control problems such as lack of direction, motivation, and competence. This research promotes insights into management control practices’ operation – given the discussion of complementarity between gainsharing, which is not a prevalent incentive system in most organizations – and objective and subjective performance evaluation. The methodology consists of a qualitative field study in a credit union using data collection, interviews, and access to documents analyzed using an interpretive approach. This research presents evidence on the phenomenon of interdependence between management control practices, adding to the literature by addressing different forms of complementarity between a group incentive system in the form of gainsharing and performance evaluation. It became evident that gainsharing reinforces the objective performance evaluation process by mitigating motivation and direction problems, while the subjective performance evaluation compensates the objective performance evaluation by shifting the focus of the evaluation to the individual’s skills. © 2021 Universidade de Sao Paulo.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to provide an introduction to how worker co-operatives and other organisations based on principles of the participatory economy have been adopted in a range of international contexts as a vehicle for transforming places with a strong aspiration to address location-specific social challenges. Design/methodology/approach: Through a presentation of four narrative cases, the paper exemplifies international experiences of co-operative approaches to place-making. It critically reflects on the philosophical and strategic underpinnings of the projects implemented in Rochdale, Preston, Bologna, Rome and Cincinnati. Findings: The practical experiences of a number of local projects of place-making involving co-operatives are conceptualised. The research has identified the importance of institutional, organisational and legal constraints for transformative cooperative-based place-making initiatives. It shows a strong relevance of the place’s historic legacy and communal governance for the choice of place-making approaches. Research limitations/implications: Further investigation is needed to establish whether co-operatives have the same driving force potential in terms of local regeneration and community wealth building place-making in non-Western contexts and less developed locations. Practical implications: The paper highlights cases that incorporate place-making practices involving the co-operative organisation and municipal participation and considers their transferability potential. Originality/value: The paper advances an important conversation relevant to researchers, educators, co-operators, politicians and local officials on diverse contemporary approaches in towns and cities that seek to reshape and regenerate local socio-economic fabric by engaging tradition, principles and organisation models developed within the co-operative movement. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {When the British colonial government took over Tanzania, colonial officials championed and encouraged the inhabitants in Kilimanjaro to grow coffee along with settlers. The authorities gave priority to the local smallholders, relegating settlers to a minor role within colonial agriculture and the coffee economy in particular. This generated a vigorous protest among the settlers against the government policy. The tension would bring a number of remarkable developments, including the establishment of the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association (KNPA) and, later, the promulgation of legislation regulating coffee farming and marketing via cooperatives, such as the Co-operative Societies Ordinance No. 7 of 1932 and the Native Coffee Control Ordinance No 26 of 1937. This paper examines the interlocked dimensions and intricacies related to the coffee industry policies, and their impact on agricultural policies in Kilimanjaro region as well as across the country. In particular, the paper discusses how the settlers' opposition influenced the promulgation of segregative, monopolistic and protectionist legislations, and the role of control Boards in this process. To do so, this paper relies on existing literature as well as underutilized primary sources obtained from the Tanzania National Archives (TNA) in Dar es Salaam. © 2021 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System},

	abstract = {Purpose: Intellectual capital (IC) has been shown to play a crucial role in promoting competitive success among cooperatives as well as in other types of organizations. However, cooperatives are rarely included in this line of research. This paper aims to analyze how IC in agrifood cooperatives influences their prominence by fostering responsible research and innovation (RRI), reputation and performance. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was developed based on a literature review, and a quantitative study was conducted, including a representative sample of the current most prominent Spanish agrifood cooperatives. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the validity of constructs, path relationships and recent advances in the predictive model assessment. Findings: This study’s findings show the specific role of human capital (HC) for enhancing social and structural capital in cooperatives. It was concluded that there is a need to revise and reconsider the role-played by IC in the cooperative movement. Research limitations/implications: The main practical contribution is to offer a specific vision of IC for agrifood cooperatives in order to maximize their market prominence. Since the study was conducted in Spain and based on a cross-sectional research approach, even though the new methodological tool partial least squares (PLS) predict was used, the authors cannot affirm whether IC will have the long-term expected effects as assumed in this research and in all contexts of the agrifood industry. Originality/value: This is the first empirical study that has examined IC in agrifood cooperatives in Spain, with attention focused on the role of HC as a predictor of market success. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Smallholder commercialization is central to international development policy and prac-tice. As a result, several arrangements to foster market linkages are being implemented. Especially popular are farmers’ organizations, which are believed to be owned, controlled, and financed by smallholders. As such, their design is considered inclusive given every household in a community is theoretically allowed to become a member, and the governance and management structure encourage participatory decision-making. However, even in the context in which farmers’ organizations are actively promoted, a notable proportion of smallholders may not be able to engage in market-oriented production or may opt for the existing alternative marketing arrangements, as dictated by individual households’ socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on the case of smallholder farming in Olenguruone, Nakuru county, Kenya, where a donor funded dairy farmers’ cooperative marketing arrangement is promoted alongside existing marketing opportunities, the present research investigated the factors that determine smallholders’ commercial farming orientation and marketing arrangements. It employed a case study approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods for a more complete empirical inquiry. The findings demonstrate that irrespective of the external support provided through marketing opportunities such as farmer organizations, smallholders’ engagement in commercial farming and marketing is dictated by the socioeconomic attributes and market perceptions that are heterogeneous among households in a smallholder community. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet adoption rates in many places are low. We investigated the factors affecting the probability of Brazilian farmers adopting an IS. Using data from 3150 farmers across all 26 Brazilian states, we tested the importance of four groups of variables in affecting adoption: farmer characteristics (age and education); farm characteristics (size and feedlot infrastructure); information networks (social networks and extension); and market incentives (export share and environmental risk). A logistic regression model found all eight variables to be statistically significant predictors of IS adoption. The two information network variables had the greatest impacts on IS adoption. This result demonstrates a central role for public agencies like EMBRAPA in developing and communicating new agricultural practices, as well as the role of producer cooperatives and associations in making information about IS technologies available to farmers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

However, it is challenging for core firms to integrate the small-scale and scatted farmers due to complex transaction processes and volatile relationships in China. Agricultural co-operatives are organizations that unite farmers’ power and help them achieve economic benefits. Our research focuses on ASCI from the perspective of co-operatives. A comprehensive cooperative framework, including trinity co-operatives and trinity federations, is conducted to figure out the position and process of agricultural co-operatives in ASCI, while QCA provides detailed collaborative patterns for agricultural co-operatives to adopt. Results show that agricultural co-operatives can achieve high economic and social/environmental performance when participating in ASCI.

Knowledge management contributes to the development of agribusinesses. The objective of this study is to analyze knowledge management practices in the supply chain of broilers at the level of farmers and compare the differences between farmers who are members of cooperatives, and those who are suppliers of firms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a sample of broiler farmers (n = 240, where 80 respondents are associated with cooperatives) from Brazil, descriptive statistics were used to measure the four knowledge management dimensions (leadership, people, process and technology). The Mann–Whitney test was performed to verify the difference in the adoption of knowledge management practices between farmers who are members of cooperatives, and those who are suppliers of firms. Findings: The results showed significant differences between the analyzed groups of broiler farmers that are members of an agricultural cooperative and suppliers of firms. Farmers who supply firms adopt knowledge management practices with greater intensity. They are also more technified and have a larger scale of production. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in a single agribusiness chain. Future studies may look at another method of knowledge management assessment to see if the results will be similar. Practical implications: The results can contribute to the development of programs and policies, incorporating knowledge management into agribusiness as a competitive strategy. Originality/value: While knowledge management is a widely studied topic, there has been little focus on this subject with regard to agribusiness. Empirical findings of an important agribusiness supply chain are provided and show the differences in knowledge management perceptions between farmers who are members of cooperatives and those who are suppliers of firms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The study identifies the influencing factors of the performance of agricultural cooperatives (ACs) in the Mekong Delta (MD) of Vietnam. The study used a disproportionate stratified sampling method, with 308 valid samples collected from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the districts and the Management Boards of ACs in 9 provinces in MD. Performance of AC is measured against five indicators, namely return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), responsiveness to cooperative members’ needs, and generation of jobs. Multivariate regression method was used for data analysis. The estimated results identified four factors that are positively correlated with cooperatives’ performance (namely management competency; contributed capital; membership size; and members’ participation) while indicating interaction between independent variables (management competency and contributed capital; management competency and membership size) in the relationship to performance of co-operatives. The study findings showed that the degree of influence of management competency on performance of cooperatives in fruit tree farming is always higher compared with those in rice farming. In addition, a number of recommendations are proposed to help the ACs’ management boards make appropriate improvements to the support policy and performance evaluation indicators of the cooperatives. Cooperatives should also innovate in the use and optimization of resources. © Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how credit unions manage accountability to government in the lightly-regulated context of Indonesia. Adopting a qualitative methodology involving a case study approach, two credit unions are examined, through focus group discussions with credit union management and review of credit unions’ annual reports and strategic plans. Findings reveal few formal compliance-based accountability mechanisms in relation to government, and limited emphasis on these mechanisms by credit unions. However, informally, credit unions involved government in various strategic ways to demonstrate accountability and legitimacy, and seek support from them, thereby managing the regulatory space to maintain a lightly-regulated context. This paper provides insights into how credit unions adopted a predominantly co-operative approach to manage and negotiate a space of limited regulation by actively demonstrating legitimacy and accountability. Presented in the form of an engagement pyramid involving four levels (i.e. compliance, self-regulation within the sector, engaging with regulators, and selectively challenging regulation perceived as unfair or unhelpful), this approach is particularly important given the seemingly less effective regulatory frameworks in more developed countries. It provides a reference for other organisations, both within the third sector and beyond, to consider how their actions might respond to and constructively shape the regulatory space, beyond comply or evade. © 2021 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.},

It hypothesizes that MOSAL controllers are effective monitors in reducing agency costs. The study employs a multivariate regression model and calculates the t-values using Roger's robust standard errors, correcting for co-op clusters due to the potential cross-sectional correlation and autocorrelation of the error terms to test a sample of 929 observations for 59 consumer cooperative societies from 2000–2018. The empirical results support the hypothesis. Further tests show that low-performing co-ops have lower agency costs. However, the presence of the financial and administrative controllers has no effect on agency costs in high-performing co-ops. Also, the effect that MOSAL controllers have on agency costs varies among co-ops. This study complements a line of research on co-op governance and adds to the empirical evidence on the association of corporate governance and agency costs. It also helps understand how regulators influence management and board discretion to safeguard co-op shareholder rights. Further, it explores an important sector and analyzes a unique, comprehensive, and rarely tested dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We develop a model of 'mixed credit markets' where pure for-profit institutions (e.g. commercial banks) can coexist with financial NPOs which feature a concern for inter-member surplus redistribution (e.g. credit cooperatives) and enjoy privileged borrower-specific information vis-à-vis their for-profit peers, while facing higher funding costs. We formally investigate market competition between the two alternative financial organizations both offering contracts whose terms entail cross subsidization. We argue that heterogeneity in organizational models can explain stable coexistence under competitive conditions, and also help us interpret the variety of market outcomes - in terms of e.g. overall coverage and market shares - as documented in modern financial systems. Importantly, the viability of redistribution-oriented NPOs is shown not to rest on under-investment issues or concerns about market power, for they can successfully operate in markets where credit rationing never arises. © 2021 Marcello D'Amato et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2021.},

	abstract = {Malian farmers’ traditional system for managing seed of sorghum, an indigenous crop of vital importance for food security and survival, can be conceptualized as a commons. Although this system maintains a wide range of varieties and helps ensure access to seed, its ability to create and widely disseminate new varieties to meet evolving opportunities and challenges is limited. A network of farmer groups, public breeding programs, and development organizations collaborating in decentralized creation and dissemination of sorghum varieties in Mali is examined regarding (1) how the network developed and what activities it conducts; (2) the resulting varietal diversity, varietal performance and organizational models; and (3) the elements of the traditional seed system that were maintained, strengthened or transformed. A single-case study approach was used that relies on published literature, official catalogues of released varieties and a database of farmer seed-cooperative requests for foundation seed. The functioning of the network and its varietal-, seed-, and organizational- outcomes are documented and the elements of the traditional sorghum seed system that are maintained or strengthened are analyzed. The evolution of the network’s reliance on commoning as a social process and its strengthening of core Seed Commons features are discussed with a view to the network’s contributions to targeted development outcomes and potential replicability. The case demonstrates how creating a framework for collaboration, enabling actors and organizations to take on collective responsibility while maintaining distributed decision-making at local level, opens opportunities for transforming farming- and food-systems towards sustainability and resilience. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Data validity was confirmed by Bartlett test and KMO coefficient and its reliability was confirmed by Cronbach’s alpha. The statistical population of this study was the agricultural cooperatives with managed by the Rural Cooperative Organization (RCO) of Isfahan Province in Iran. The results of this research showed that from the members’ viewpoint, the highest corporate social responsibility was in the legal dimension and the lowest was in the discretionary dimension as based on the Carol model. The research results show that the organizational commitment index of managers is nearly of 50%. The results of cluster analysis in the field of members ‘perception of cooperative social responsibility showed that the four variables such as: performance satisfaction, members’ participation in cooperative meetings, age and purpose of membership, predicts the members’ behavior in separating the cooperative into two groups with strong and weak the CSR. Also, the result of cluster analysis in board of director’s organizational commitment showed that the variables such as: level of education, management experience and belief in the non-interference of other institutions in cooperative management, predicts the board of directors organizational commitment behavior in separating into two strong and weak the OC. © 2021 University of Deusto.

	abstract = {In places where state has been historically the most dominant actor of all reforms, it can be particularly challenging to develop non-state forms of organization and governance such as agricultural cooperatives known to reduce transaction costs and utilize economies of scale. This paper explores the latest state policy on the development of agricultural cooperatives in Uzbekistan through the prism of its compatibility with the existing institutional conditions. An exploratory case study approach was used to conduct interviews with representatives of key actors involved in the policy formulation at the national scale and its implementation in two pilot provinces. Applying the analytical instruments of the procedure for institutional compatibility assessment (PICA) on the one hand and based on empirical insights from in-depth interviews (n = 22) and internal policy documents on the other hand, we have identified a set of crucial institutional aspects (CIAs) and their relative importance for the establishment of the cooperatives in Uzbekistan. In addition to the incompatibility of an excessively and exclusively regulatory nature of the intervention with the desired voluntary form of cooperatives’ organization, we find that main sources of the policy (in-)compatibility lie within the degrees of information asymmetry, farmers’ trust towards the state, and the capacity of the authorities. Although the state's top-down approach was effective at quickly establishing the cooperatives formally, most farmers were informed about the policy only symbolically, who then remained largely skeptical about its value, and considered the state responsible for its implementation. The findings highlight the need for a change in broader institutional environment and allowing time for learning and internalization of self-organization principles by farmers in order to make the economic advantages of cooperatives possible. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: We surveyed the literature to identify different performance metrics of credit unions and a set of possible factors that might affect their performance. We collected data related to different dependent and independent variables from financial statements and balance sheets of 189 credit unions and from general websites like Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada. Then, we imputed the missing data and developed fixed effect and random effect panel data regression models. First, we used return on asset as the main dependent variable. Afterwards, we used six performance metrics to check the robustness of our models. Findings: From an initial list of 16 possible factors that might affect the financial performance of a credit union, we were able to narrow the factors down to the nine most significant ones. It was observed that credit unions in the prairies were more likely to perform well financially as compared to other provinces. Membership size, the size of a credit union in terms of total assets, capital adequacy ratio, market penetration, diversification of income, inflation rate and provincial GDP and interest rates were significant. The cross-sectional analysis performed confirmed the findings of the fixed effect panel data models. Research limitations/implications: This study has a limitation concerning the number of years included into the time series analysis. Only ten years worth of data were available. Practical implications: Results provide credit union management, service providers for credit unions and market analysts with a current understanding of how different internal and external factors might affect return on assets, return on equity, delinquency, cash ratio, efficiency ratio, asset growth and loan growth. Our models can be used to predict financial performance of credit unions based on the defined significant variables. Originality/value: Although there is a wide body of literature that studies performance of banks, not many studies focus on credit unions. Moreover, the existing studies are based on credit unions in United States or Europe, and literature on Canadian credit unions is scarce. The data collected covered 189 Canadian credit unions. To our knowledge this is the first study that looks at the various internal, external and regulatory factors together that affect the credit unions in various jurisdictions of Canada. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Cooperatives cover a large part of the agricultural sectors and have substantial market shares in agri-food supply chains in the EU Western countries. They account for approximately half of agricultural trade in the EU. By contrast, in the EU Western countries, where farmer cooperatives are widespread and successful, agricultural cooperation in Lithuania has developed intermittently in the last century. We still have very limited knowledge of why the country’s agricultural producers (especially smallholder farmers) are reluctant to cooperate in Lithuania. The aim of this study is to assess the level of the willingness to cooperate among smallholder farmers in Lithuania and to draw up the profiles of small-scale farms that participate in and intend to join cooperatives and, conversely, that do not participate in cooperatives and do not intend to do so. To achieve this goal, a representative survey of small-scale farms was conducted. Results of surveys carried out in 2019 in Lithuania on a group of 1002 small-scale farms showed that only 8% of the surveyed farms participate in producer groups or cooperatives, while another 8% intend to participate. Small-scale farms in Lithuania have weak market integration, with no bargaining power on input and output markets. The vast majority of small-scale farms are reluctant to participate in cooperative activities in Lithuania. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the profile of a small farm that tends to cooperate. The main social characteristics of farm managers and economic factors of farms willing to cooperate have been identified. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The study adopts a social network approach by focusing on two relational social ties: information sharing and advice-seeking. Building on a case of a 55-year-old dairy cooperative in India, the social network analysis finds information-sharing relations among members to be inclusive, with no members isolated, and information exchanged along formal and knowledge hierarchies. Likewise, information sharing is horizontal, with information smoothly exchanged even among new and already established members, as is the transfer of leadership roles from the older members of the cooperatives to the younger members. Advice-seeking networks tend to be a bit more centralized toward board members and members exerting day-to-day leadership because of their knowledge and expertise regarding the organization and its policies. Our analysis suggests inclusive information sharing among members and a well-structured and functioning advice and knowledge-sharing network that contributes to learning of the cooperative members. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Consistent with agency theory, prior studies of credit unions report an association among individual monitoring mechanisms, trade association monitoring, and female board representation, respectively, and reduced loan losses. This study provides a more nuanced understanding by investigating the moderating influence of these monitoring mechanisms on the relationship between loan losses and deprivation and by considering the effect of bundle combinations of different levels of the two monitoring mechanisms on loan losses. The results reveal that credit unions subject to trade association monitoring have the lowest loan losses. However, in the absence of trade association monitoring, female board representation has a moderating effect on loan losses as deprivation increases. Finally, trade association monitoring and female board representation have a substitutive, rather than a complementary effect on loan losses. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Information was collected through mixed method research, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected via interview from 30 knowledgeable experienced stakeholders of Thai co-operatives, with information recorded for later analysis. Quantitative data were collected via a survey involving 300 co-operative organisations from seven categories of enterprise, taking relevant samples, and was analysed together with the data from interviews with member stakeholders. Analysis also utilised descriptive statistics, namely: frequency, percentages, averages, and standard deviation. Results revealed that Thai co-operatives were in compliance with all seven principles to a reasonably high standard in the following order of statistical significance: 2nd (highest), 7th, 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th (lowest). From these findings, it is recommended that Thai co-operative leaders strive for continued improvements, developing higher standards and consistency among their members and staff to achieve greater parity with the International Principles and the worldwide co-operative business community. This can be facilitated through better education, extension of knowledge, personal development, and encouragement for staff and members. It is also suggested that the government provide additional support for co-operatives in working together to achieve a common goal. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

Primary data were obtained from 59 active and 14 inactive cooperatives in the selected districts. The study concludes that Ghanaian cooperatives in the sample bear much resemblance to the traditional form which emerged in Europe and North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Generally, such cooperatives have relatively small memberships from local communities who use a democratic governance system and do not delegate control to outsiders. While the cost of owning and transacting is limited with such characteristics, many traditional cooperatives lack the specific knowledge, economic efficiency, and resource endowment necessary to become or remain competitive. Indeed, the active cooperatives listed finance, access to inputs, tractor services and poor leadership as key challenges, while inactive cooperatives blamed poor member commitment as the primary culprit for their inactivity. Efforts aimed at promoting and supporting farmer cooperatives should focus on addressing these key challenges. Also, financial and technical support should probably be conditional on group performance and not group formation itself. © 2020 Edgard Milhaud Foundation},

	abstract = {Although economies of scale are relatively well studied in the arts, economies of scope have received less attention. Yet recent trends toward freelancing and technological connectivity make scope economies especially timely in addressing structural challenges to artist-led incubators. This paper offers a conceptual framework for cooperative strategies that employ economies of scope both in the economic sense of joint production and in the financial sense of risk pooling. This framework distinguishes franchise, federation, and resource-sharing organizational structures as developed through case studies of two US-based organizations: ArtBuilt and REC (Resources for Every Creator), placed in a larger context of cooperative organizational strategy in the USA and Europe. The proposed strategies of cooperative networks (quasi-franchises, federations, or resource-sharing networks) also draw on a literature of spatial agglomeration in creative industries. The framework leads to more speculative ideas of “balance-sheet philanthropy” through credit backstopping by foundations, and of novel investment trusts that can be piloted across a range organizations including foundations, grant-makers, artist residency programs, and even for-profit companies engaged in reinsurance. The paper contributes managerial tools and strategies for the creative engagement of capacity building in arts organizations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Inclusive business as a model at the base of the pyramid is a relatively recent unit of study in academic literature. From the institutional perspective, businesses are affected by norms, processes, rules of moral and ethical behaviour, which have not been studied for the base of the pyramid in inclusive businesses, much less in agricultural cooperatives. The objective of this research is to identify institutional factors that can affect agribusiness inclusive models. In this research, agricultural cooperatives of banana production in the province of Magdalena, Colombia, are the unit of analysis to identify institutional factors. The method of review of institutional factors is the multiple cases (six banana cooperatives) with a simple unit using inductive analysis. The results show that institutional factors—both formal (certifications, quality standards, social responsibility policies and economic incentives) and informal (cooperation, improvement of quality of life, generation of social capital)—promote the development of inclusive businesses in cooperatives of the base of the pyramid. The research is a first step to show its potential replication in other agricultural industries and even in other economic sectors. © 2021 Institute of Rural Management, Anand, Gujarat, India.},

	abstract = {The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognized the importance of forests in combating climate change and agreed upon financial support for REDD+ activities in developing countries through the Warsaw REDD+ Framework (WRF). The REDD+ activities for conserving carbon stored in forests to reduce GHG emissions and to enhance the carbon sink function of forests are expected to serve as an important means for achieving the climatic goal. In this study, a set of criteria was devised to assess the REDD+ Measuring, Reporting, and Verifying (MRV) implementation capabilities of developing countries, which was applied to analyze the REDD+ MRV levels in REDD+ countries. Based on the Forest Reference Emission Level/Forest Reference Level (FREL/FRL), National Strategy (NS), National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) and Safeguard Information Summary (SIS) the countries submitted, 36 REDD+ countries submitted only the FREL/FRL (Group I), while 5 countries fulfilled the WRF requirements and registered REDD+ reduction results (Group II), and 6 received Results-Based Payments (RBP) (Group III). From longest to shortest, the periods for which the International Fund provided support were arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, verifying the relative importance of international support. From highest to lowest, the overall MRV capability was also arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, although Group I or Group II was at a higher level than the other groups in some elements. REDD+ countries in the Readiness Phase (Group I) would aim to have the MRV capabilities of Groups II and III to receive RBP, and international support for REDD+ MRV capacity building could enable them to do. However, in addition to the receipt of RBP, REDD+ should be reflected in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as consistent reduction results at the national GHG inventory level, and the advancement of REDD+ MRV is expected to be a necessary and sufficient condition for REDD+ cooperation under the Paris Agreement cooperative approach framework. For the following groups, international cooperation is essential. Countries in the Readiness Phase need to be supported with the establishment of an MRV framework, which will enable them to achieve REDD+ to receive RBP and be reflected in NDCs. For REDD+ countries that have thus far met the WRF requirements, the REDD+ scope needs to be upscaled to national levels, and the MRV system should be further advanced to establish a cooperative approach system that can achieve more ambitious reduction targets through forests. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Short rotation plantations (SRP), also called short rotation coppice, can contribute to bioeconomy by satisfying the rising demand for wood raw material while strengthening the rural economy. However, farmers all over Europe show limited adoption of SRP. Marginal lands are considered a promising option for producing SRP biomass and avoiding conflicts with food production. This study focuses on the Malacky region in Western Slovakia because of suitable land quality and a board production site close by providing a significant local market for the produced biomass. Qualitative interviews in 2018 explored personal and situational factors that influenced local farmers’ (N = 19) willingness to adopt SRP. Slovakia’s land fragmentation in combination with the required landowner’s consent, competition with food production, and lack of identification with SRP were identified as prominent barriers. The economic benefit from using low quality lands and environmental benefits from SRP were identified incentives. Moreover, the study found agricultural cooperatives more open to SRP than agricultural business companies, as they are more interested in the economic benefits and prefer agricultural activity over fallow land. Because the study identified conflicting views about the possible impacts of SRP on the environment and the rural community, it is considered crucial to provide farmers with science-based facts on these issues. This aspect should also be acknowledged to increase acceptance of stakeholders, such as land owners, governmental actors, and the general public, which is needed to develop measures to encourage SRP. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In several Spanish regions, collective action through production and marketing cooperatives has traditionally concentrated the food supply of small and medium-sized farms. However, many cooperatives are threatened by the risk of abandonment of members' cropland, which reduces their sourcing capacity. In this context, joint cropland management initiatives have become a useful form of social and organizational innovation. This research's contribution is twofold: it examines the relevance of some drivers of this organizational innovation, and it determines the cooperative characteristics or combinations of characteristics that can sufficiently explain the adoption of a joint cropland management strategy. Some cooperatives' features have been a priori identified as related to the achievement of joint cropland initiatives: economic size, social innovation, innovative behavior, and collaborative orientation. The study is mainly based on data from a cooperatives survey, and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) methodology has been used. The analysis has been completed by surveying cooperatives' managers about their opinions on a joint cropland management strategy's main advantages and drivers. Results indicate that social and economic innovation, size, and propensity to cooperate with other cooperatives are key factors that help create a cooperative profile capable of tackling the challenge of land abandonment and the consequent loss of production. © 2021},

This model consists on a local-based strategy of common land management, led by a cooperative and supported by a set of external agents. As empirical evidences, we show the attitudes of cooperatives’ managers surveyed towards common land management and present a case study implementing this multi-actor model.

The risk sharing and benefit distribution mechanisms are important governance arrangements that affect cooperation longevity in member-heterogeneous cooperatives. However, the relationship between cooperatives’ risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangements and cooperation longevity is not well understood. To address this research gap, we provide a conceptual framework to illustrate the relationship between risk sharing, benefit distribution, contract form and cooperation longevity. By conducting 23 interviews with three dairy cooperatives in China using a multiple-case-study method, we find that cooperation longevity is influenced by the alignment of the combination of risk sharing and benefit distribution for cooperatives and their members. Following the principles of risk-benefit equivalence and strategy-risk preference matching, we discuss four scenarios of match or mismatch of combinations of risk sharing and benefit distribution. We suggest that the government needs to strengthen risk mitigation capabilities for cooperatives and members, and to help them to build an effective risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangement to achieve sustainable development. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Edge-of-fieldwater quality monitoring was conducted in cooperation with private landowners through the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watershed Initiative, a landscape conservation program first offered through the USDA-NRCS in 2010. The study objective was to quantify effectiveness of individual conservation practice or practice combinations on water quality on corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] watersheds. Water samples from northern Missouri farms were collected and analyzed by runoff event for sediment (total suspended solids [TSS]), N, and P to evaluate the effects of crop production, residue types, and conservation land treatment on runoff. The presence of living vegetation in the winter, whether established as a cover crop or cash crop, significantly reduced the sediment loads (p <.0001) and nutrient loads (p ≤.0077). Additional benefits occurred on sites that produced higher residues, like corn or corn with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Significantly low TSS losses occurred during soybean years with corn and winter wheat residues. Sites that implemented full land treatment, having conservation practices that serve to avoid, control, and trap a pollutant, were more effective than those with fewer treatments, especially with respect to P loading. The mean rank for orthophosphates was 45% lower from sites with avoid, control, and trap practices instead of control practices only. Data support the conclusion that conservation structural and management practices are effective and can mitigate some negative impacts generated by agriculture. Although an intricate endeavor, edge-of-field water quality monitoring can serve to complement other forms of environmental analysis and inform landowners about efficient farming practices. © 2021 The Authors.

Materials and methods: tools and methods of financial assistance, including grants, for peasant (farm) farms in the Sverdlovsk region are analyzed. These mechanisms are used in the implementation of state programs for the development of the agro-industrial complex at the Federal and regional levels. The identified problems of agricultural development allow us not only to formulate recommendations for improving the mechanisms for implementing measures to support farmers, but also to pay attention to aspects that are not taken into account by state programs. The authors relied on statistical, structural, analytical, system, logical, and correlation analysis. The normative legal basis of the study was chosen by the normative legal acts of Russian Federation and Sverdlovsk region, including state programs, national and priority regional projects implemented in the field of agriculture, and official materials of state statistics. Results: the effectiveness of the main instruments of state support for farmers in the region is evaluated, recommendations for improving the mechanisms of support for farmers in Sverdlovsk region are developed, and directions for the development of rural cooperation are proposed. Discussion: the article presents a socio-economic analysis of the support and development of peasant (farm) farms by the state government authorities of Sverdlovsk region. The authors pay special attention to the fact that during the implementation of state programs and projects, certain aspects are not taken into account when evaluating applications for state funding, which were identified by researchers in Estonia and Latvia. Conclusion: it is necessary to regularly assess the effectiveness and then correlate the tools used to support peasant (farm) farms. In order to increase efficiency, it is necessary to apply correlation analysis of statistical data to public authorities and conduct sociological research (in the future). © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

That is why in every cooperative the economic character of capital must be observed in order not to corrupt the cooperative business model, including the interpretation given to the 3rd Principle of Members' Economic Participation. However, when they allocate their surpluses, a large part of Brazilian credit unions opt to remunerate the member's shares in society, preferring the formation of individual savings over collaborative funds that strengthen the enterprise itself.

	abstract = {The Social and Solidarity Economy in the urban environment of Mexico City was expanded from the conditions of unemployment and labor precariousness generated by liquid modernity from its beginnings. The search for labor stability necessarily takes us back to the times of the Welfare State, which contributed to the construction of a sense of community in the urban environment. The objective of this research was to analyze proximity or distance to the characteristics of work in the liquid and solid modernity and the Social and Solidarity Economy of small family cooperatives in Mexico City. The questions to be answered in this article are: Are the working conditions that were present in the Welfare State the same as those proposed to be achieved by the Social and Solidarity Economy? And, being two different theoretical frameworks, what then are the particularities of work in the Social and Solidarity Economy? The research methodology was mixed, quantitative for the selection of cooperatives that met two requirements: appropriate cooperative management and economic viability, this was done through a discriminant analysis, a multivariate statistical technique. The database used to perform the discriminations was that of the 2015 “Economic Diagnosis on Cooperativism of the Federal District”, with 192 cooperatives representative at 90% confidence of 1,589. The methodology was developed in detail in Luvián, Rosas, and Ramírez (2019) from the crossings resulted in 22 cooperatives with the economic viability and 130 with appropriate cooperative management, from which 12 cooperatives were reached that met both criteria. However, for reasons of accessibility, only eight could be interviewed. The qualitative methodology considered the theoretical approach to determine the categories of analysis and thematic axes of the interviews: capital-labor, space-time, and community and individual. The principles for internal management were taken from cooperativism: democratic control, democratic participation, and autonomy and independence; with emphasis on democracy through the organization chart (General Assembly, Board of Directors, and Supervisory Board). The interviews were applied to the legal representatives of the cooperatives. The responses were analyzed employing the categorization method to process the text of the interviews through categories and subcategories and thus present through words or short phrases the similarities and differences of the interviewees through the themes and components of the topic. The categories were organized through networks with the Atlas ti.8 software, examining mainly aspects such as the basis and density of the networks with the co-occurrence method. The results show that cooperatives present stability conditions like those existing in solid modernity such as: maintaining the equivalent of a fixed salary, having a stable workplace, fixed working hours, and forming a social welfare fund. However, there are fundamental differences in the way these conditions of stability are achieved in the Social and Solidarity Economy, which have to do with the organization of work within cooperatives. The main difference between work in solid modernity and work in the Social and Solidarity Economy is the existence of emancipated work. Emancipated work is a work of unique characteristics, it is not exploited work, since the ownership of the means of production of the cooperative is collective, it is not subordinated either because decisions are taken horizontally and mainly by consensus; it is not sanctioned, its fulfillment is given practically by the feeling of community of the cooperative; it is a work that allows creativity and human development. The literature supports the evidence that stability generates predictability and long-term planning due to the commitment of the members; this condition is present in cooperative management thanks to the existence of emancipated labor. In the long term, the space-time relationship of half of the cooperatives that operate with generational change in a family manner stands out. Future planning has been translated into concrete strategies for market growth, improvement of infrastructure, equipment, and use of the principle of open membership, by recovering the creativity of the members in the General Assembly. The research distinguishes two types of members, the leaders who act to guarantee collective stability through their shared commitment, direction, empathy, and recognition of the work done, which legitimizes them, and the followers who support the leaders’ efforts to maintain labor stability; both under a social relationship that is not based on surplus value. It is argued that the cooperatives have the capacity to make decisions shared because the consequences derive from the work of both. In the analyzed cooperatives there are no restrictions to the deployment of leadership, the results show a better positioning of the cooperatives that have more leaders because having more members involved in management enhances democratic participation and collectively acquired knowledge. This was exemplified by the activities of the management positions of the Board of Directors and Supervisory Board, which, following the law and commitment to the organization, contribute strategically to production, commercialization, and sound accounting, activities on which the conditions of stability depend (although there are also leading members without management positions). The limitation of the research has to do with the number of cooperatives interviewed and the characteristics of qualitative research, which prevents the results from being generalized to other cooperatives in Mexico City, other states, or the country. However, the results are theoretically framed in the structural tendencies experienced by the subjects of liquid modernity in neoliberalism, so they can be a reference. The originality and implications of the work lie in recognizing the ambivalence in the rationality of the subjects, when identifying the coexisting modernities to know what makes the stability of cooperatives possible in the urban environment, even when apparently only individualism and competition could prevail. On the other hand, emancipated work is a category little explored in the Social and Solidarity Economy, it emerged from both theoretical and applied analysis and made it possible to examine particularities that are deployed from the form of organization and management presented by cooperatives that adhere to a greater extent to the principles and cooperative organization. Emancipated work requires the collective control of the means of production typical of the Social and Solidarity Economy to advance towards an alternative economy and contributes to creative and democratic work that improves the living conditions of the partners and consequently their own life, and even those of the following generations for the creation of loyalty, feelings of community, identity, and enjoyment of the fruits of work. © 2021.

While the notion of food citizenship suggests innovative ways that consumers can contribute to sustainable transitions, there is a dearth of research on what it means for a person to act as a food citizen and the kinds of governance processes that enable food citizenship. Using a case study of a consumer cooperative, Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative, in Japan, this paper examines how consumers and producers act as food citizens, and the ways that governance processes affect food citizenship. Three sets of analyses are presented. First, the aspects of Seikatsu Club's governance system that promote and facilitate food citizenship are analyzed. Second, what it means to be food citizens and the kinds of activities consumers and producers partake in as food citizens are examined. Third, the ways that food citizenship impacts consumer-producer relations and sustainability are discussed. Specifically, the analysis of Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative indicates that food citizenship can facilitate mutual understanding and partnership between consumers and producers, and a sense of ownership by them over the food system and sustainability. In concluding, the implications of the findings on Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative for governance, food citizenship, and sustainability more generally are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article analyzes agricultural reform as an element of broader shifts in the Japanese welfare regime. In postwar Japan, agricultural support and protection served as a “functional equivalent” to welfare provision in rural and semi-rural areas. However, an ongoing agricultural reform process has put pressure on aging smallholders and on JA, the powerful organization of agricultural cooperatives. This article investigates how these local actors have responded to an increasingly hostile socio-economic and political environment. To address this question, the article focuses on hamlet-based collective farming, which is a form of agricultural production that can reproduce the welfare character of the postwar support and protection regime on the local level. Based on field research in several rural and semi-rural communities, the article argues that the functions and the local proliferation of hamlet-based farming are shaped by village institutions: hamlet-level norms and rules governing land use and agricultural cooperation, as well as social ties between hamlets, local co-ops, and local governments. While the integration of village institutions into local cooperative and administrative structures can support a systematic local proliferation of collective farming, municipal and cooperative mergers have rendered such comprehensive local responses more complicated. More generally, the article proposes to investigate local acts of recombining community ties and norms with changing macro policies as a promising analytical angle to understand the ongoing renegotiation of East Asian welfare regimes. © Pacific Affairs.},

Using a nationally representative survey dataset of smallholder maize producers from rural Nigeria, this study assesses the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on technical efficiency (TE). We based our estimation approach on the combination of a newly developed sample selection stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to control for possible selectivity biases from both observables and unobservables. We estimate stochastic meta-frontiers to examine TE differences between cooperative members and non-members. Our results reveal that TE levels of members are consistently higher than that of non-members.

Research limitations/implications: This research is based on five case studies; further research is recommended to establish the current typology. Practical implications: This study shows very clearly that the cooperative business style can be offered for businesses previously operated according to socialistic principles. Originality/value: This study augments current literature by elucidating the speed with which business activity is conducted according to cooperative principles.

This was done by adapting and testing a measurement scale based on the one-dimensional model proposed by Porter. Design/methodology/approach: Field work was carried out, with a structured questionnaire being given to a significant sample of workers in Ecuadorian cooperatives (2,499 employees and heads of department). The scale was adapted through a structural equation model. Findings: The results show that the adaptation of the measuring scale for affective organizational commitment using a one-dimensional vision is consistent for the cooperative sector. In addition, the analysis of the socio-demographic variables and the work position show that some of them have a statistically significant relationship with organizational commitment. Practical implications: The proposed scale can contribute to the management of human capital in cooperatives in Ecuador. It can also be used as a tool to support the national agency in charge of the cooperative sector in this country (Superintendencia de Economía Popular y Solidaria, “Superintendency of Popular and Solidarity Economy”). By applying this tool, social economy organizations in Ecuador can measure the level of their employees' affective commitment with the institution they work in. Using the results, the people in charge and the leaders of the organization shall be able to introduce strategies to develop this organizational variable that is crucial for the proper management of human resources and, therefore, to help to obtain the institutional purposes. Originality/value: This research project presents a measuring tool that can discover the unique features of the cooperative sector in a developing country such as Ecuador as it provides a special framework for managing human resources in this sector. Additionally, in a cooperative organization many employees have different roles in the same company. This tool can be adapted for other kinds of cooperatives with different activities (financial and non-financial activities) in different sectors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The paper mobilizes both management, organization and innovation literatures, together with a case study based on data from farmers, cooperatives and distributors in the pork sector. The originality of the paper lies in its modelization of sustainable demand-supply chains.

The concept of coopetition continues to gain attention as global competition increases. However, the analysis of the influence of institutional elements on coopetition has been limited. This study bridges this gap. We use a case study to examine the coopetition framework among competing Japanese airlines formed to negotiate with major institutional elements: a monopolistic supplier and a government regulatory authority. First, this study identifies the mechanisms through which institutions promote coopetition. The findings point to coercive isomorphism and external hazard as influential institutional mechanisms; through coercive isomorphism, the shared benefits increase, and the cost of cooperation is reduced; through external hazard, organisations are encouraged to unite, and coopetition is promoted. Second, the study identifies the mechanisms through which organisations in coopetition enhance their bargaining power. Specifically, we find two sources of enhanced bargaining power: intensified pressure as a larger group and improved persuasiveness with consensus. These findings have important implications for the theory and management of co-operative organisations, such as for the interaction between co-operatives and institutions, since the coopetition framework we analysed has characteristics close to the values and principles of co-operatives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This study aimed to identify and describe the main success or failure factors affecting agricultural cooperatives. To this end, bibliographic research was used as a research method, and 108 relevant works from the national and international literature were selected for analysis. The results pointed to the existence of 10 main success factors for agro-industrial cooperatives: conciliation of the dual agenda: social and economic goals; professionalisation of management; meeting the interests of multiple stakeholders; transaction cost management; risk and volatility manage-ment; improved commercialisation; competitiveness against traditional companies; technology adoption; sustainable development; and social responsibility.

	abstract = {Karnataka is one of the states, which experienced severe drought continuously for four years since 2014. In addition, heavy rainfall for the past two years has adversely affected agriculture produce in the entire state putting farmers into debt trap as most of them are not covered by crop insurance for crop failure. Although crop insurance was available to farmers in India since 1972, the coverage across the states including Karnataka was not found to be satisfactory. The average percentage of farmers covered under crop insurance was less than 10% during 1999-2015, both for India and Karnataka. It was 11.3% under NAIS 2015 kharif, increased to 12.2% in 2016, 17.1% in 2017 going down to 15.6% in 2018 and to 14.1% in 2019 under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) kharif in Karnataka. PMFBY was one new kind of agriculture insurance company and introduced throughout the country in 2016.This paper examines the performance of this scheme with specific reference to north Karnataka based on primary data collected from farmers’ survey in four districts, secondary data collected from official documents and first-hand information gathered from regional stakeholder workshops organized in six selected districts of north Karnataka. The study tries to look into the extent of coverage and, flaws and merits of crop insurance schemes with reference to problems faced by farmers in getting insurance coverage and claims. The study covered around 1000 stakeholders including farmers, officials of banks, department of economics and statistics, agriculture department and insurance agencies, representatives of gram panchayats and cooperative societies. Three agricultural crop seasons have passed since then. Central government has brought in some changes in guidelines and is likely to make further changes in procedures in response to concerns expressed by States and farmers’ representatives. Follow up discussions with key stakeholders in Karnataka held after the initial farmers’ survey reveal that while a few of the anomalies in applying for crop insurance have been addressed by the concerned departments, major obstacles in assessment and claims continue to exasperate farmers who are miffed by these procedural lapses. This paper throws light on some of these issues and discusses measures to make crop insurance, particularly PMFBY farmers’ friendly. © 2020, Nan Yang Academy of Sciences Pte. Ltd.

	abstract = {Digital platforms have disrupted traditional news organizations, with new platform-based models gaining ground. However, the incumbents can defend their positions and reap the benefits of multi-sided market structures by establishing a platform business model themselves. We examine a case study of the Austrian News Agency (APA), which gradually formulated a strategy that resulted in a platform-based business model. Platform features were strategized and innovated over time and in phases, with the intent of creating value for customers on both sides of the platform. We found that APA’s platform transformation was enabled by a visionary value proposition backed by a trusted institution’s legitimacy and a co-operative organizational model that provided added incentives for the participating news media companies. The strategy and the business model emerged on the basis of external developments and internal realizations concerning the feasibility of the new platform strategy. Based on our results, we develop a framework for an incumbent strategy formation process towards a platform business model. This framework demonstrates the incumbent organization’s emergent, as well as deliberate, strategic ability to introduce platform features into its business model, based on unique intra-firm synergies with established parts of the business, and highlighting a potential for “incumbent advantage.”. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Among other things, fertility control in Nigeria may not be feasible without recourse to socioeconomic issues such as micro-occupation classification and dominant family cultural traditions facing women and their relationship to fertility behaviour. Rural small-scale women farmers are a relatively closed group with some uniqueness for the understanding of the value of children (VOC) in socioeconomic and cultural contexts and its relationship with fertility behaviour in developing nations. This study, guided by the VOC model, focuses on determining factors for preference for family size (0-4 children) among rural small-scale women farmers in Eha-Amufun in Enugu state. 200 married women (mean age = 33.9; mean age at marriage = 24.5) from 20 agricultural co-operative societies were selected for the study. The study adopted a survey and quantitative research design. Besides the sociodemographic information of the study participants, the study elicited from the respondents information on their choice of family size, the connection of family size with their occupation and the circumstances surrounding son preference and son adoption in the family and rural contexts. The collected data were analysed using the ordinal logistic regression model. The findings show that economic independence, son preference and male child adoption negates limiting family sizes to 0-4 (p<.05) however, age, formal education, children as source of labour and economic independence were positively correlated with the desire for a family size of 4 children and above. In view of the limitations of the study and the ability of the VOC model to unveil spurious factors for fertility behaviour among women, there is a need for comparative studies of rural closed groups in developing nations and their fertility behaviour. © 2021, Bundesinstitut fur Bevolkerungsforschung.

	abstract = {This study used the United Kingdom and feed barley as case example to highlight the potential of climate mitigation policies in the global north to create food vulnerabilities in the global south or widen the food gap between the global north and south. Future UK feed barley supply was assessed under the influence of projected climate change, climate mitigation policy scenarios, and population growth. The results showed that land-based climate mitigation policies reduced land area for barley and created large deficits in supply. Using Algeria and Tunisia as exemplar global south countries that rely on barley supply from the United Kingdom and Europe for food and feed, the article concludes that pursuit of land-based mitigation policies, in the global north, which reduce the production of globally important food security crops, can create or amplify food vulnerabilities in the global south. Tunisia's imports, for example, are about 290% of domestic production. These countries need feed barley to maintain high domestic animal production for food and religious needs, which limit meat imports. The asymmetries in technical, economic, and political power between the global north and south imply that the latter could be outcompeted. In serving the climate justice principle of "equitable sharing of burdens and benefits,"the article argues that climate mitigation policies should address (not amplify) the uneven geographical and social impacts of climate change. This principle should be integral to the appraisal of public policies and actions on land-based climate mitigation policies and prioritized in climate justice discourse in a genuine global cooperative framework. This is as urgent as the need for climate mitigation action. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of organizational structure and variations in legal systems on the MFI dual performance goals. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample that includes 1,518 MFIs from 105 different countries over a period of 20 years, this study analyzes the data by applying a model that includes six categories of organizational structures and variations of legal systems, including both civil and common law, with accounting performance measures for the dependent variables. Findings: The analyses provide robust results indicating that MFIs structured as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have better social outreach than all other types of MFIs and exhibit better financial performance than MFIs registered as commercial banks or credit unions. Legal systems also played a role in MFI effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: Given the increasing importance of MFIs on economic development globally, this study has relevance on how the impact of MFI structural characteristics and macro-level influences on their dual performance criteria can be translated into management approaches and governance policies that can increase the effectiveness of these dual (i.e. social and financial) goals. Originality/value: This study is more comprehensive than prior research in addressing the influence of organizational structures of MFIs and legal systems on MFI dual mission, namely, its financial performance and social outreach, thereby increasing our understanding of policy implications in sustaining the MFI’s developmental role. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Hom Mali rice contains various unique characteristics with one being its aroma. A reduction in the aroma or 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) of Hom Mali rice during post-harvesting activities has become a major problem for stakeholders and exporters in the rice supply chain. This paper investigated logistics and processing cost analysis of the rice mills of two agricultural cooperatives, AC1 and AC2, by using the activity-based costing (ABC) method. Moreover, the relationship between the loss of aroma and the cost processing activity has been explored using partial correlation. Findings showed that the total cost of AC1 was 4.986 baht/kg, which was separated into the logistics cost of 58.18 percent and the processing cost of 41.82 percent. The total cost of AC2 was 5.851 baht/kg, consisting of the logistics cost of 77.34 percent and the processing cost of 22.66 percent. For the processing activities, the significant relationship between the activity costs and the loss of aroma, while controlling the levels of 2AP, suggested that aroma retaining must regard decisions on the selections of processing activities including polishing, whitening, bagging, and dehulling activities. In the logistics aspect, the cooperatives should focus on raw material receiving, warehousing, packing, and transportation activities. Decisions on the improvement of logistics and processing activities involved with aroma loss of Hom Mali rice should rely on cost analysis, maintaining the quality of rice, and meeting both domestic and international demand. © 2021 Kasetsart University.},

The social capital concept is integrated with cooperative lifecycle theory to describe the change of cooperative social capital along the lifecycle. We propose that cooperatives in different stages of the lifecycle are featured with different levels of social capital. Cooperatives usually enjoy a high level of social capital in the early stages of the lifecycle. However, the level of social capital in cooperatives exhibits a declining trend along the development of the organization. The decrease of social capital will lead to an imbalance of the social and economic attributes of cooperatives. The cooperative’s governance structure must change accordingly. We argue that it is important for cooperatives to maintain and develop the social capital strategically over time. Otherwise, the comparative advantage of the cooperative business form may disappear. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

We show that relative membership heterogeneity in equity and patronage holdings and a cooperative’s dividend policy are crucial in determining the optimal level of governance centralization.

However, there is limited evidence regarding the effects of cooperative membership on women. In this paper, we evaluate impacts of membership in women-only and mixed-gender cooperatives in South India on women’s intra-household decision-making power, using data of 313 female milk producers. Propensity score matching and a two-step control function approach are employed to account for selection bias due to observed and unobserved factors. We find that membership in either women-only or mixed-gender cooperatives has a positive impact on intra-household decision-making power. In particular, members of mixed-gender cooperatives gain significantly more power over decisions regarding dairy production, compared to members of women-only cooperatives. We conclude that women-only cooperatives are not more effective for women’s empowerment than mixed-gender cooperatives. However, because women have limited access to mixed-gender cooperatives, women-only cooperatives are generally more accessible for the majority of them. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to answer the research question: How do cooperative organizations perform when created by government fiat in an emerging market? Through the use of institutional and agency theory, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the cooperative form of organization and investor-owned firms-investigating how the social–political structures in a community affect the efficiency of cooperatives vis-à-vis investor-owned firms. This paper also attempts to offer a better understanding of how government quality and organizational size influence performance outcomes between different organizational forms specifically in the Philippines. Design Methodology Approach: The empirical analysis of this study was conducted among electric distribution utilities in the Philippines. Firm-level data was generated for 133 distributors, consisting of 119 electric cooperatives and 14 investor-owned companies. Panel data regressions were ran to test all hypotheses. Findings: Cooperative organizations operate at a less efficient rate than investor-owned firms in the Philippines, even when controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, customer density and profitability. In addition, the efficiency of these cooperative organizations is more strongly influenced by the quality of the local government than investor-owned firms. Originality Value: Positive externalities generated by the propagation of cooperatives on local communities may be based primarily on our understanding of how cooperatives have functioned largely in western contexts. Within the context of Southeast Asia, where national socio-political structures may be more dysfunctional, this paper observes that there is an equivalent negative externality caused by the tendency of cooperatives to replicate the political mismanagement of the community around it. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper analyzes how excess payment for Fairtrade-labeled coffee is distributed in the Swedish market, using information on production costs and scanner data on almost all roasted and ground coffee products sold by retailers. A key finding is that roasters and retailers get 61-70%, while producer countries, in this paper comprising coffee farmers, cooperatives, middlemen, exporters, and Fairtrade International, get 24-31%; Fairtrade Sweden gets 6-8%. These values are the upper and lower bounds that reflect assumptions made about the additional costs of producing roasted and ground Fairtrade coffee, given the cost of beans and the Fairtrade license. The Fairtrade label thus seems to create a coffee product that roasters and retailers can use to exploit their market power. © 2020 by the author.},

To build customer trust and provide members incentives, the organization structures itself as a producer cooperative and sets up a parallel sector that yields cash revenues and provides short-term benefits. This parallel activity, if successful, may represent a temptation away from revolution, but it is subject to competition from other providers or from the state. The main result is that, unlike a profit-maximizing firm, the cooperative reacts to increased competition by shrinking the parallel sector and specializing in revolution; hence, reform expands at the expense of revolution only if the parallel sector approaches monopoly. We find supportive historical evidence in a survey of socialist revolutions and social democracies, nationalist movements, and Islamist insurgencies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The study investigates determinants of e-commerce within the context of Kenyan SACCOs. The study was conducted in Nairobi County and all the licensed SACCOs under (SASRA) Sacco Society Regulatory Authority in Kenya were included in the study. Key findings indicated that 76% of the companies can be classified as adopters. The implication here is that nearly three out of every four SACCOs have adopted at least one form of e-commerce to support their business operations. The key factors identified in the study to influence e-commerce adoption in the participating SACCOs were technology cost (88%), available budget (41%), and senior management support that were captured from about 25% of the respondents. From the study, two critical barriers to effective utilisation of e-commerce for SACCOs in their business operations are the conservative organisation cultures that can be summed up as resistant to change and lack of peerage on the industry standards.

Agricultural cooperatives have played an important role in promoting the modernization and intensification of Chinese agricultural sector. Given the increasing concerns about environmental harm, however, it still remains unclear whether and the extent to which agricultural cooperatives contributes to reducing environmental impacts of agricultural production. Hence, this study performed an environmental evaluation using life cycle assessment for three different organization forms of grape production in Changli County, Hebei Province, China: smallholder farmers, farmer-owned cooperatives and investor-owned firm-led cooperatives. Then the results of life cycle assessment were monetarized and cost benefit analysis was used to evaluate the economic performance of these three organization forms of grape production. The results demonstrate that investor-owned firm-led cooperatives present an overall improvement in environmental and economic performance with the lowest weighted environmental index (integrating all impact categories into a single score), the highest net profit and the highest total net benefit. The results also show a difference in potential improvement in environmental impacts and economic returns between cooperatives and smallholder farmers. Additionally, the production and application of organic and chemical fertilizer and pesticide have been identified as major contributors to total environmental damage. © 2021 Deng et al.

Academic/practical relevance: In a cooperative (co-op), operational and financial decisions are inseparable because the co-op's investment capital is linked to its economic transactions with members. We include unique features of co-ops into an analytical model and derive some key results that are different from those for investor-owned corporations. Methodology: In the presence of yield and market uncertainty, we model this situation using a Markov decision process wherein the decisions of processing quantity interact with the financial decisions of retained earnings and short-term loans. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the aggregated farmers' payments over a finite horizon. Results: (1) Characterization of the properties of the value function and the optimal policy; (2) explicit expressions for the deterministic yield dynamic program, wherein a myopic policy is optimal; and (3) identification of financial risks associated with uncertain market and yield. Managerial implications: The results provide insight into a coop's decision making, cash position, and risk management. © 2019 INFORMS},

This article examines the introduction of co-operatives on New Hanover and Buka islands and their subsequent failure. In the aftermath of these disappointments, new local organizations arose and adopted many of the positive practices learnt during the co-operative period. These new groups provided both material and cultural independence, and, further, proved to be micro-nationalist movements with a power base capable of challenging the Australian administration. This article argues that co-operatives have been undervalued and overlooked as a platform for Indigenous notions of socio-economic development and micro-nationalist movements. Co-operatives broke down clan affiliations and inspired Indigenous Papua New Guineans to operate beyond their normal alliances, to act with coordination, agency and a clear agenda. © 2019 The Journal of Pacific History, Inc.},

We analysed not only direct effects but also the possibilities of mediating these effects to increase the overall effect on IP. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from managers of agribusinesses in Slovakia (175 respondents). We used the partial least squares structural equation modelling method and the appropriate software to test the theoretical research model and the proposed hypotheses to examine the relationships among the individual selected constructs in more depth. The findings point to the existence of a statistically significant relationship between EO and IP, which, however, is weaker than the overall effect of the involvement of mediation variables. Each mediation variable (IWB and KBDC) increases the overall effect separately, but their joint mediation action is of the greatest importance, when full mediation takes place. The strength of the relationship between the two main variables is also influenced by the size of the agrarian enterprise such that being larger has a negative moderation effect. Significant differences were also identified in the legal forms of business in favour of companies over agricultural co-operatives (ACs). © 2021, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The agricultural producers’ cooperative game problem in contract farming is formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear program. Using the strong duality theory of stochastic linear programs, we not only prove that the core of agricultural producers’ cooperative game is nonempty but also provide a simple way to compute a profit allocation policy in the core. We establish the convexity of agricultural producers’ cooperative game so that the game has population monotonicity, which gives agricultural producers an incentive to expand their current coalition. We then analyze the agricultural producers’ cooperative game with a concave cost structure, which may exhibit economies of scale for production. Taking advantage of the proposed stochastic duality approach, the agricultural producers’ cooperative game with a concave cost structure is also shown to have a nonempty core. © 2020 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

The researcher used probit model in analysing the driving forces behind self-employed workers' financial planning for retirement. Findings: The study revealed that bank/credit union/savings and loans savings, building of apartments for renting, investment in SSNIT pension, investment in treasury bills/fixed deposits, investment in ownership of business and private insurance pension are the types of financial plan that exist for self-employed workers towards their retirement. The study found that age, marital status, level of education, household size, number of children, renting a house, life style of the future retiree, income, risk level of job and types of retirement plan are the driving forces behind the retirement plans of self-employed workers. Practical implications: Using the identified types of financial plan and driving forces in this study, governments in the developing countries can develop and implement self-employed pension schemes, educate and encourage more self-employed workers to plan for their retirement.

However, there is limited information on their current status and the key factors driving their operations in the country. This paper sought to address this informational gap by reviewing the existing literature in the country from the theoretical background of sustainable development and later validating the obtained findings with the current state of knowledge at regional and global levels. Results from document content analysis indicate that there are over 10,000 tree growing farmers organized into planting groups across the country after many years of piloting by the government and private sector players. At the national level, there are two associations. These include Kenya Forest Growers Association (KEFGA), mainly composed of large scale planters, and Farm Forestry Smallholder Producers Association of Kenya (FFSPAK), targeting small-holders. Besides these two, six major sub-national associations are seeking to improve members' welfare by enhancing the acquisition of livelihood assets. Further, various socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect their operations in Kenya. These associations have deployed multiple strategies to benefit their members. However, the formation of savings and credit cooperative societies (SACCOs) seems to be their preferred mode of community empowerment. In conclusion, even though these associations are still at the infancy stage, their future remains promising in-view of the observed behavioral change in their governance, which appears to favor entrenched equality and equity towards sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.},

Recently, the design principles have been generalised to study human groups in other collective action scenarios, including farm producers who collectively buy inputs or sell outputs. Several case studies have conceptualised farmer cooperatives as common property institutions to study how various collective action scenarios have been approached. We contribute to the scarce literature with a field study in the Upper West Region of Ghana, using Ostrom’s framework to compare the design principles of active and inactive farmer cooperatives. Using the mean group comparison method, we find numerous significant differences as active farmer cooperatives have clearer boundaries, require more capital investments, have more active board directors and managers, receive more governmental support, and have more locations. However, not all design principles are significantly different for active and inactive cooperatives (e.g. sanctions, legal rights). Considering our results, we perceive opportunities to formalise the conceptualisation of farmer cooperatives as common property institutions with both internal and external design principles. Our results also have policy implications in terms of top-down initiatives to spur collective action by Ghanaian farm producers. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Numerous studies on corporate governance proposed the connection of boards' characteristics on firm performance and reputation. However, the results are mixed and limited research in the co-operatives context has creates a great interest to fill the conspicuous gap. This study seeks to examine the potential relationship between board characteristics and co-operative reputation in Malaysia from the perspective of resource-based view theory (RBVT). Hence, multiple regressions were conducted to analyze the relationship between co-operatives reputation with the respect of Top 100 Co-operatives Index and board characteristics in terms of board size, ethnic diversity, gender diversity, age diversity and education diversity in this study. The sample is composed of 61 listed co-operatives in the Top 100 Co-operatives Index for the three-consecutive year during the period 2015 to 2017. Reputation data were obtained from Top 100 Co-operative Index that published at Malaysia Co-operative Societies Commission (MCSC) website. While, the data of board characteristics and co-operative size on log of total assets which lagged by a year were extracted from MCSC's INFOKOP system that provides both financial and non-financial data. The results found that Malaysian co-operatives that appear high up in terms of ranking in the reputation MCSC index tend to have a greater proportion of high educational directors on their board. Other board characteristics including board size, ethnic diversity, gender diversity and age diversity were not associated with the reputation of co-operatives. This generally can be explained that different types of law, geography, historical background, cultural environment and other factors may affect composition and diversity; and particularly the board in co-operative societies. Findings of this study provide insights into potential strategies in relation to corporate governance towards improving co-operative's values and indirectly help the government in achieving the national economic goals. © 2020, Sciedu Press.},

Interviews were conducted with district council members and representatives from the boards of directors. The data from both case cooperatives indicate a genuinely traditional democratic member governance structure. There is a great deal of social capital in the governance system. A tentative explanation of the member involvement is that the cooperatives’ equity capital is owned by the individual members, and the members are free to sell and buy their shares at a market rate. The members are satisfied with the return on the capital they have invested in the cooperatives. They receive bonus shares and dividends above what most members would get in other investments. A conclusion is that very large cooperatives may succeed well with a member-democratic governance system of the traditional cooperative type, which in this case is probably due to the members’ satisfaction with the individualized ownership of the cooperatives. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods/Statistical analysis: A research model was developed, based on previous studies, by selecting Empowerment, Use of Collective Intelligence, and Continuous Learning, selected as Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture, and Servant Leadership and Perceived Organizational Support (POS) as the influencing variables. The relationships among variables were identified using regression analysis and mediating effect analysis. The subjects were workers working at headquarters of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and the Agribusiness Group. The questionnaire survey was conducted for about one month from Jan., 2020 and a total of 157 valid samples were obtained. SPSS (Ver. 22.0) was used in statistical analysis. Findings: The results showed that the Servant Leadership has statistically significant effect on Empowerment and Use of Collective Intelligence but not on Continuous Learning which are Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture. The Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has statistically significant effect on all of the Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture: Empowerment, Use of Collective Intelligence, and Continuous Learning. The results of mediating effect analysis showed that POS partially mediated the effect of Servant Leadership on Empowerment and Use of Collective Intelligence and fully mediated the effect on Continuous Learning. The results suggested that, for the establishment of agile culture in an organization, it is very important to exercise Servant Leadership, which is a leadership that maximize the potential of the members of the organization based on the spirit of human respect, and to give to members the perception of the full support and rewards provided by organization. Improvements/Applications: This study was conducted for employees working at a specific organization therefore it is difficult to generalize the results to overall industries and organizations. In the future, it is necessary to expand sample population and to conduct comparative studies between groups that have introduced agile organizational culture and ones that does not. It is also recommended to conduct additional studies on the factors of leadership and organizational support that have effect on the characteristics of agile organizational culture. © 2020, Sciedu Press.},

Saudi Arabia is particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events, such as arid weather and drought. The purpose of this study is to assess farmers’ beliefs and concerns as regards climate change. Extensive interviews were conducted with 164 farmers in the Jazan region. Results revealed that 89.6% of the farmers believed that climate change is due to human activities and 93.3% believed that it is because of natural change. Seventy-five percent of the farmers were concerned about insects and 73% about the prevalence of weeds on their farms. Findings of cluster analysis revealed that farmers who are more likely to believe in climate change are more in agreement with the role of extension services in capacity building. Farmers’ beliefs about climate change were significantly influenced by membership of agricultural cooperatives, access to loans, use of extension services, age, farm size, and level of soil fertility. Access to loans was the only significant factor to explain the differences in farmers’ concerns. These results suggest the need for capacity‐building activities targeted at improving farmers’ adaptability to manage climate variability. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Post-1994, the South African government has favoured cooperatives over other types of corporate entities in its rural development programmes. An improved understanding of the key drivers underpinning the performance of cooperatives is important for informing government programmes and policies that target cooperatives. This study examined the financial efficiency, and its determinants, of 387 agricultural cooperatives in South Africa, using the Simar–Wilson methodology. Bias-corrected Data Envelopment Analysis estimates for financial efficiency were obtained in the first stage. The results indicated that many agricultural cooperatives are relatively inefficient, compared to the three best-performing cooperatives on the efficient boundary. In the second stage, a double bootstrap truncated regression model was used to obtain bias-corrected scores that excluded the best-performing cooperatives. The statistically significant efficiency determinants identified from the analysis were the age and size of the cooperative, the gender of the principal manager of the cooperative, its governance and the training indicators. The observed relationship between governance and efficiency may be attributed to institutions that prioritise non-financial goals by being relatively more willing to compromise on governance quality. Furthermore, deviations from sound institutional control mechanisms are more likely to emerge in cooperatives that have weak institutional and organisational arrangements. © 2020 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

	abstract = {Context: the consolidation of an economic system based on competition has not eliminated the importance of cooperation for life in society, or the continuing emergence of cooperative organizations, even in a hostile environment. Why do they continue to emerge? What are their possibilities? What happens when they are developed? Objective: to comprehend, in theoretical terms and on the basis of existing research, the cooperation phenomenon, especially that which inspires cooperative organizations. Methodology: the research employed a systemic and complex conception of the cooperation phenomenon and of its object of study, developing a qualitative, interpretative, and reflexive discussion according to three themes: being, doing, and becoming. Results: Cooperatives, as human organizations, go through an evolutionary process, suffering the inherent problems of administration and maintenance of democracy. To face the degenerative process, it is necessary to rethink cooperative management based on systemic theories and self-reinforcing cooperative identity. Conclusion: cooperation is fundamental for life in society, which explains the fact that cooperatives continue to emerge even in the midst of a hostile environment. Contrary to what has been disseminated, we are not only competitive, we are also cooperative and our knowledge needs to be urgently reconstructed. © 2020, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The literature regarding the factors that influence the growth of financial companies is scarce, so this study constitutes a first approximation to understand the factors that influence the growth of financial companies. The data were obtained from the Superintendency of Banking and Insurance and Pension Fund Administrator (SBS for its acronym in Spanish), which is the supervisory body of the microfinance system in Peru and covers the 2005-2014 period. The panel data model with fixed and random effects was used to compare the hypotheses. Two measures of business growth were used: financial income, and the number of workers. The independent variables used were: Placements, deposits, interest rate, delinquency, economic growth, and age. Deposits were found to positively influence the growth of municipal savings banks while delinquency negatively influence the growth of municipal savings banks in Peru. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Contaduría y Administración.

	abstract = {Following implementation of the Agricultural Cooperative Law in July 2007, the number of cooperatives increased dramatically, as did the related research in China. The objective of this paper is to describe articles written in Chinese and published in the top six Chinese Agricultural Economics journals between 2007 and 2017, identify research trends and issues, generate observations, and provide insights for future research. A secondary objective is to introduce to the non-Chinese speaking world a literature written by Chinese scholars as they view the emergence of this new organizational form in the agricultural sector. Our interest is to illustrate Chinese cooperative literature within two general approaches: articles which address agricultural cooperatives’ inter-firm coordination issues and articles which study the mechanism design which we call intra-firm coordination. A total of 443 articles were reviewed, 163 dealing with inter-firm coordination and 280 with intra-firm coordination. The inter-firm coordination articles focused on firm coordination mechanisms and formal institutions such as cooperative law, accounting rules, financial markets, and government support. Intra-firm coordination articles focused on organization design, cooperative governance, relationships between members and cooperative, property rights, and hierarchical structures with embedded principal–agent issues. We conclude with observations about trends, quality, and the cooperative future and also propose useful research fields for Chinese scholars. © 2020 Edgard Milhaud Foundation},

	abstract = {Infection of wheat by Fusarium species can lead to Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) and mycotoxin contamination, thereby reducing food quality and food safety, and leading to economic losses. Agronomic management through the implementation of various pre-harvest measures can reduce the probability of Fusarium spp. infection in the wheat field. To design interventions that could stimulate wheat farmers to (further) improve their agronomic management to reduce FHB, it is key to understand farmers’ behaviour towards adapting their management. The aim of this paper was to understand the intention, underlying behavioural constructs, and beliefs of Dutch wheat farmers to adapt their agronomic management to reduce FHB and mycotoxin contamination in wheat, applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Data were collected from 100 Dutch wheat farmers via a questionnaire. The standard TPB analysis was extended with an assessment of the robustness of the belief results to account for the statistical validity of the analysis on TPB beliefs (i.e. to address the so-called expectancy-value muddle). Forty-six percent of the farmers had a positive intention to change their management in the next 5 years. The two behavioural constructs significantly related to this intention were attitude and social norm, whereas association with the perceived behavioural control construct was insignificant indicating that farmers did not perceive any barriers to change their behaviour. Relevant attitudinal beliefs indicated specific attributes of wheat, namely yield, quality and safety (lower mycotoxin contamination). This indicates that strengthening these beliefs—by demonstrating that a change in management will result in a higher yield and quality and lower mycotoxin levels—will result in a stronger attitude and, subsequently, a higher intention to change management. Interventions to strengthen these beliefs should preferably go by the most important referents for social norms, which were the buyers and the farmer cooperatives in this study.

Limited evidence is available on whether POs are inclusive of poor farmers. Even if the poor join, do they participate in decision-making? We conducted interviews with 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya. We distinguish three groups; members of a bargaining PO, members of a processing PO and non-members. We show that membership is related to the structural characteristics of the organization: processing POs favor membership of farmers that are wealthier, more educated and more innovative. As to participation in the decision-making process: older, male and specialized farmers have a higher chance of being involved than poor farmers. Factors distinguishing farmer participation in decision-making between bargaining and processing POs are highlighted. We find that a bargaining PO is more inclusive of all groups of farmers, while women and poor farmers are excluded from decision-making in a processing PO.

There exists, however, the problem of high heterogeneity within cooperatives regarding members’ commitment, with many passive members holding only formal membership and having a minimal understanding of the cooperative's principles and benefits. The main objective of this study was to analyse how varying levels of members’ commitment determine their economic benefits. We selected a total of 215 rice farmers (72 active and 143 passive members) from two rice-dominant districts and used the propensity score matching technique and endogenous treatment regression model for the analysis. The study results show that educational level, distance to the cooperative, members’ perception about trust and acceptance, and value of the investment in the cooperative have a considerable influence on member commitment. The results further indicate that actively committed members of the cooperative achieve much more economic benefits than passive members. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The incidence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) contamination in raw milk and its association with herd types was investigated in the ten provinces of Southern China in 2018. A total of 797 raw milk samples were collected from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Anhui provinces. The herd types were classified according to their characteristics. Among the 797 samples, 401 were owned by large-scale farms (herd size >500 cows, for dairy cow farming), 303 were owned by milk processing plants (herd size >500 cows, for dairy cow farming + milk processing), and 93 were owned by small farm cooperatives (herd size ≤500 cows, for dairy cow farming). The results revealed the presence of AFM1 in 94 of the 797 samples (11.80%). None of them was above 500 ng/L (Chinese and US limit standard), whereas 0.88% were above 50 ng/L (EU limit standard). The AFM1 concentrations in samples non-compliant with the EU standard were 52, 61, 88, 89.5, 164, 240, and 486 ng/L, respectively. It is important to note that samples exceeding the EU limit were mainly found in the area of Jiangsu and Guangxi provinces, and the herd type of milk processing plants. Hence, it is necessary to monitor and enforce the regulatory compliance of AFM1 levels in the raw milk from these specific areas and herd type.Highlights A total of 797 raw milk samples from three herd types, were collected from ten provinces of Southern China in 2018. Ninety-four of the 797 raw milk samples (11.80%) were positive for AFM1, and none of them was above the Chinese and US legal limit, only 0.88% of samples were above the EU limit. All of the exceed samples defined by EU limit were found in the area of Jiangsu and Guangxi provinces and belonged to milk processing plants. © 2021 The Author(s).

This conceptual model was tested with survey responses from 345 organizational leaders representing three sectors of the economy: international companies, US credit unions, and American foundations. The survey assessed key components of the above constructs and our regression models explained close to half of the variance in organizational vigilance scores relative to competitors. The most important of the four factors above was investment in foresight (for each sector), followed by leadership commitment. The relative importance of strategy and accountability factors varied by sector as well as organizational size. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector. © 2020 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: A typology of agricultural cooperatives’ potential for multirational management in relation to corporate governance is proposed. Coordinates based on data from assembly participation and separation of ownership and control are used to map cooperatives among these typologies. Four case studies representing each typology were conducted, allowing analysis of propositions. Findings: By mapping the cooperatives from Mato Grosso do Sul, a reduced potential for multirational management is noted. By analyzing the four case studies, coded as Coop 1, 3, 13 and 16, this study found convergence with P1, P2 and P3. “Coop 1” shows signs of adopting exploitation practice. In “Coop 3,” evidence points to avoidance practice and, analyses of “Coop 13” indicates adoption of tolerance practice. In Coop 16, however, P4 could not be confirmed. Instead of polarizing practices, there is evidence of avoidance practice. Therefore, a positive relation between corporate governance and multirational management can partially be observed. Originality/value: There are no records of a paper that has explored the relation of governance and multirational management. Therefore, this research broadens the understanding of how corporate governance can function in the context of cooperative organizations. As well, insight is given on how different mechanisms of corporate governance can influence organizations to adopt explicit or implicit and monorational or multirational methods of dealing with multiple rationalities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study seeks a greater deepening of the allocation of property rights in agricultural cooperatives in Mato Grosso do Sul/Brazil. The qualitative research was carried out in 4 agricultural cooperatives, two considered an emerging model and two traditional cooperatives. The investigation was conducted through the analysis of minutes of Ordinary General Meetings, statutes, and semi-structured interviews with managers and presidents. It was observed that the agricultural cooperatives, seen as an emerging model, where there is a selection of new members and act in a purchasing pool format, demonstrate an evolution concerning the traditional model by pointing to a greater professionalization of management, evidence of the separation between property and management. Moreover, the emerging model becomes more attractive than the traditional one by efficiently allocating the residual rights (earnings). © 2021. All Rights Reserved},

	abstract = {Social enterprise is a model of hybrid organization driven by the need to generate positive externalities by reinvesting their surplus for social and environmental objectives. One of the biggest problems arising from joining financial goals with social goals is the presence of increasing tensions between the members and stakeholders involved. Nevertheless, there has not been enough focus on how managers, employees, and stakeholders respond to the tensions caused by contradictions and how they try to reach a balance between financial, environmental, and social goals. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating how members of an agricultural cooperative in the Apulia region (Italy) try to join the organizational forms of business and social values, namely, the sustainable practices related to CO2 emission reduction, resource use efficiency, and food waste mitigation. Additionally, the study goes further and explores whether and how these contradictory pressures are solved. Starting from the sensemaking approach, the study carried out an inductive case study through the use of a multiple case study design and in-depth interviews. The findings highlight the following two novel aspects: (1) Managers prefer to adopt a cumulative mitigating hybridization approach and (2) a weak integration can be noticed between social and commercial dimensions, originating from a lack of holistic perspective and poor interorganizational communication. © 2020 by the authors.},

Following El Salvador’s “turn to the left”, Salvadoran agrarian reform cooperatives and civil society allies began to allocate organizational resources toward writing public policy measures to incorporate agroecology under the FMLN government’s agricultural social program, the Family Agriculture Plan (PAF). While the cooperative sector took part in active negotiations with the FMLN party for the institutionalization of favorable policies, the former guerrilla party formulized strategies for gaining a multiclass electorate in order to remain in power. With the intention to better understand the attitude and distinct Salvadoran actors, we utilize an anthropology of public policy framework to indicate how expectations of political party legitimacy failed to shape the institutionalization of agroecology in El Salvador. We suggest that the pursuit of agroecological policies is a balancing act of making use of the State to strengthen on the ground efforts without forging organizational disarticulation following changes in government administrations. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {A global shortfall in protein supply from capture fisheries has motivated the Malaysian government to revise its aquaculture strategy, focusing on three commodities: seaweed, fish and marine shrimp. However, the performance of the Malaysian aquaculture sector, particularly seaweed production, is poorly documented. This is the first empirical study to undertake a value chain analysis (VCA) of the Malaysian seaweed sector using stakeholder perceptions and secondary data that encompass members of seaweed farming cooperatives (the Semporna Area Farmers’ Association and the governments’ flagship Seaweed Cluster Project). Fieldwork was conducted between April and June 2015 among seaweed stakeholders involved in the value chain using a mixed methods approach—in-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions, household surveys, personal observation and secondary data. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from both upstream (seaweed farming, marketing structure and the Malaysian Good Aquaculture Practices [MyGAP] certification programme) and downstream (seaweed processing) activities involving farmers, intermediaries/middlemen (buyers), processors and officials. Kappaphycus spp. was sold in two forms: (1) dried seaweed to be used as raw materials in carrageenan processing (approximately 90% of total harvest) and (2) fresh seaweed to be used as a source of seedlings (approximately 10% of total harvest). The value chain ended with the carrageenan form, which is exported to international markets. The price of dried seaweed varied according to a combination of seaweed quality, the strength of farmer’s relationships with intermediaries and processors and in response to demand from the carrageenan industry. The prices obtained by Malaysian farmers for dried seaweed and carrageenan remained low, US$ 0.60 and US$ 4.43 per kg, respectively, despite efforts by the government to enhance the value chain by imposing seaweed standards (via MyGAP) for farm management, dried seaweed and semi-refined carrageenan. The VCA was a useful tool to identify and map the market, with the results providing a better understanding of the seaweed sector, which could be helpful in supporting further aquaculture development in Malaysia. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to test the hypothesis of positive correlation between the innovative work behavior (IWB) support on the part of agricultural managers and the production performance of agricultural companies, mediated through information sharing in the companies. The research was performed on a sample of 175 companies of primary agricultural production in Slovakia. All data was analysed using the SPSS version 22.0 software package. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to assess the internal consistency of scales reliability. The Baron and Kenny mediator model was also used. The hypothesis was confirmed by the research. Complete mediation was identified where up to 91.6% of the overall effect is mediated through the sharing of the information variable. The practical implications of the research point out that the transparency of communication and support of innovations introduce positive effects in relation to the performance of agricultural companies. The IWB support is a predictor of production performance of agricultural companies. However, it does not have a clear effect; the effects of other factors are important. The IWB support positively affects the production performance of companies through the sharing of information between the managers and the employees, which becomes an important tool of innovative management. Agricultural cooperatives and joint stock companies can profit less significantly from the IWB support through the sharing of information than limited liability companies. The effect of IWB support on the production performance of cooperatives in natural expression shows statistically less significant impact. © 2021, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Method: A descriptive quantitative research (911 individuals) was applied, using structural equation and cross-sectional modeling, with an instrument based on Dessler (2006), Lings and Greenley (2005), Tortosa, Moliner and Sánchez (2009) and Park and Tran (2018). Originality/Relevance: The study of specific aspects of Internal Marketing (communication, leadership and information systems) is new in the context of Marketing. Previous work has focused especially in communication, as it already satisfies the most visible need for Marketing activities in organizations. Results: The results indicated that there is an effective contribution of internal communication to organizational objectives, and that the process of communication and leadership play a key role in these objectives. However, it was found that information technology systems, acquired to facilitate the organization's communication process, have a negative influence on internal communication and its objectives. Theoretical/Methodological contributions: This work contributes to the Marketing literature, addressing elements of the Internal Marketing process little studied so far. Managerial contributions: For managerial purposes, the results allow generations-adjusted internal communication decisions, especially gen Y. © 2021 Revista Brasileira de Marketing.

This paper offers a solidary critique of ACs beyond the dominant institutional economics lens, and aims to resume the debate on their de/repoliticisation. Evidence presented points towards a continuous process of co-optation of ACs by the dominant food regime as well as decreased adherence to cooperative principles, revealing theoretical parallelisms with the organic and fair trade movements. While acknowledging the important role ACs play in supporting farmers, many of who interviewed for this research reported they could not survive without them, this paper warns of the loss of their historical political roots, and introduces a new theoretical framework for a more integrated study of ACs in the context of wider food system forces. The framework is composed of three conceptual components: first, the coooperative triangle illustrates interwoven cooperative identitary dimensions; second, the cooperative hourglass depicts ongoing tensions between the cooperative economic and governance model, and the market economy they exist in; and third, the concept of cooperative sustainability brings together the previous two components to analyse ACs' ability and capacity to maintain the dimensions indicated in the cooperative triangle while also fostering environmental sustainability through their practices. © 2020},

While most of them have been set up as agricultural service cooperatives, there is also the option of forming agricultural production cooperatives (APCs). Although both models stem from a similar long tradition, it was argued that production cooperatives were not competitive, thus having no role in agricultural development. Historically, these cooperatives were formed under specific conditions only. However, in recent years, they have been observed in villages characterised by family agriculture. Taking the example of Chongzhou County (Sichuan Province, China), this exploratory study investigates the salient conditions under which farmers voluntarily join such cooperatives. The results show that APCs still have a role to play in agricultural development after all. Certain conditions have to be met, like government support and recruitment of professional farm managers, but particularly a homogeneous membership and transparent decision-making processes. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Generally, there are two competing agrifood governance models for advancing sustainability: technocratic and deliberative democratic procedures. Taking up Fischer’s (Citizens, experts, and the environment: The politics of local knowledge, Duke University Press, Durham, 2000) call to develop new ways of bringing citizens and experts together in governance, this paper examines an integrative sustainability governance system that uses both technocratic and deliberative procedures. Drawing on a case study of a Japanese consumer cooperative, Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative, this paper analyzes the ways that technocratic and deliberative governance procedures use different forms of knowledge, measure and assess sustainability differently, and produce different outcomes. The analysis finds that whereas technocratic forms of governance are most effective at monitoring, verification, and compliance assurance, deliberative processes facilitate relationships, mutual understanding, and commitment among stakeholders. For sustainability governance to address not only the technical but also social dimensions of sustainability, the findings on Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative’s integrative governance system support the need for deliberative procedures. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

In that perspective, this study discusses jurisprudential theories of regulation of financial cooperative societies in Tanzania with specific concentration to Primary SACCOS’ Credit Advancement (PSCA). The discussed theories are; natural law theory, social contract theory, command- and-control theory, sociological theory, law and economic theory, legal instrumentalism theory, and market failure theory. It is important to note however that, market failure theory is not yet adopted as a jurisprudential theory rather it is a general economic theory of regulation. It is therefore suggested in this study that, market failure theory is to be adopted as one amongst jurisprudential theories of regulation. Its adoption promises the better and conducive legal and regulatory framework for not only effectiveness of PSCA but also sustainability of other economic activities in the country. Because, market failure theory has an essential nature of positively impact changes from traditionally rigid and hyper-regulation form of legal and regulatory frameworks to more market friendly regulatory culture.

Structural behavior of frames build from Araucaria angustifolia glued boards and vegetable oil-based polyurethane adhesive was evaluated. Tests were carried out to characterize wood and adhesive to obtain verification/sizing parameters. Initially, a full-scale structural project was conducted to meet standard laying poultry house specifications. Afterwards, five units of straight three-articulated frames on a 1:2.5 reduced scale were designed, built, and subjected to strength tests until breaking. They were built with a 2-meter free span and a 15° slope, suitable for using metal roof tiles. The average for structure ultimate strength was 4.14 times the design load. Structures had satisfactory mechanical performance and displacements lower than those recommended by NBR 7190 (1997) standard (ABNT).

The paper explores the possibility of vertical coordination being strengthened through the development of agricultural cooperatives and informal farmer groups. In two reported case studies, these organizations have been shown to be called into life by the need to advance vertical coordination. Moreover, the case studies reveal that downstream agribusiness agents, who normally oppose farmers’ countervailing power, promote, support, and even initiate cooperatives and farmer groups, in order to implement food safety standards. The emerging cooperation among farmers not only enhances their participation in the value chain but also generates mutual trust. © 2021 The Author(s).},

The information was collected through a questionnaire applied to controllers or equivalent (accountants / controllers), who inquired about the characteristics of the cooperatives, the control practices used and the level of importance attributed to them, as well as Identify the stage of the organizational life cycle of these entities. The results showed that the practices of the "1" and "2" stages were the most used / valued by the respondents, since the average levels of use (62% and 64.67%, respectively) approached those of importance 65.00% and 72.25%). However, those practices belonging to the "3" and "4" stages were effectively underused and less valued by the Controllers, since the average degrees of importance (42.75% and 47.25%, respectively) exceeded the respective average levels of Use (9.67% and 13.67%). Also, with regard to the life cycle, evidence has been found that leads us to believe in the association of the practices used in the life stages of these cooperatives, especially those classified in the "Maturity" phases ("D", "E" and "F" And "Maturity / Decline" ("A" and "C"), but less evident in those in the "Maturity / Growth" stratum ("B" and "G"). © 2020, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

Findings: Three groups of factors determine the utility the farmers derive and subsequently their engagement in brand development. Farm business characteristics include farmers’ age, the attainment of quality certification and cultivated area, while psychological factors include farmers’ attitudes toward local reflections of the brand, perceptions regarding the need for farm business external support and consumers’ interest, as well as farmers’ commitment to quality requirements. Farmers’ strategies related to the share of products sold by cooperatives and to individually use the brand also determine their engagement in a brand development scheme. Research limitations/implications: Future research should distinguish producers according to the marketing channel they choose and their industry, and explore the intentions of intermediate marketers. Practical implications: Marketing cooperatives should undertake initiatives to develop local brands effectively, taking into consideration the factors that impact farmers’ engagement, while food marketing firms should properly adapt their purchasing and promotion strategies. Public authorities should formulate a policy mix that enhances farmers’ knowledge related to marketing issues and encourages farmers to strengthen their positions in the marketplace. Originality/value: The research reveals a strategic proactive behavior of farmers favoring the development of local brands, and provides insights into the factors that impact farmers’ adoption decisions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency in financial intermediation and the cost efficiency in banking service of credit unions in Brazil, based on essentially accounting variables, and to analyze the temporal evolution of the efficiency of these cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: With a sample of 315 cooperatives over the period from 2007 to 2014, this research uses a two-stage process: application of regression models with panel data to verify which variables are related to the defined outputs, with the reduction of 31 variables to 8 variables in both models; and application of the data envelopment analysis method to obtain an analysis of credit unions’ efficiency. Findings: The results demonstrate a high level of efficiency in financial intermediation, with low variation over time, associated with a low efficiency in the banking service, in which few cooperatives have remained efficient over time. In addition, the cooperatives with highest efficiency in financial intermediation were also the most efficient in providing services. Research limitations/implications: This research has some limitations about the capacity of the proxies used to capture the real effect of the variables and assumptions of economic relations resulting in restrictions to generalize the results. Practical implications: Cooperatives are usually analyzed under just one dimension. By separating the analysis into financial intermediation and banking services, cooperatives that are more efficient in each dimension can be identified, in addition to analyzing the evolution over time. The authors found that efficiency tends to be lower in banking services, and few cooperatives remain at the highest level of efficiency over time in both models. Social implications: Credit unions provide an important service in the banking and credit market. Therefore, understanding its operation and the characteristics that influence its efficiency allows a better management of the cooperatives themselves and a greater understanding of this important segment of the financial market. © 2020, Manuela Gonçalves Barros, Marcelo Botelho da Costa Moraes, Alexandre Pereira Salgado Junior and Marco Antonio Alves de Souza Junior.},

Also, the article discusses legal environment, government attitude and development trends of credit unions' in Poland. In conclusion, the de lege ferenda postulates regarding credit unions' regulation in Poland are presented. Credit unions in Poland conduct not for profit business activity only with their members with reservation to mediating in specific contracts on financial market which can be also conducted with nonmembers. Credit unions activity is subject to supervision of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (FSA). Therefore credit unions regulation is characterized by duality of legal regime of private and administrative law. However, in certain fields of credit unions activity the FSA's supervision, performed under administrative legal regime, raises justified doubts in the light of the principle of cooperative autonomy as the FSA by law has the authority to impose specific orders and prohibitions on credit unions. © 2020 University of Deusto.

The representative farms for each region were defined at meetings with sheep farmers and technicians via the rapid appraisal methodology and represent 65% of the state’s flock. The information of each representative farm was collected between March 2015 and February 2016. Principal component analysis was used to verify the relationships among the different variables that characterized the farms. These characteristics were: number of ewes (V1), total cost per kilogram of revenue-generating product (V2), feeding costs (V3), labor costs (V4), facility and equipment depreciation costs (V5), and gross margin in the production cycle (V6). Cluster analysis was performed, resulting in three distinct groups: one including eight, another seven, and the third, nine farms. The results aided in classifying the farms into groups with similar characteristics, such as production scale, reproductive efficiency, technical and managerial control, appreciation of cooperatives, and availability of continuous technical assistance. The production scale, reproductive and productive efficiency, adoption of technologies, and cooperative organizational structure can be emphasized as positive performance benchmarks and were the most important aspects to achieve positive economic results. © This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

We show that if the upstream firm is organized like a traditional cooperative, where the members have free delivery rights and where surplus is shared in proportion to the deliveries, the downstream firm is less subject to a holdup. The cooperative form makes it possible for the upstream firm to credibly commit to deliveries. Traditional cooperatives are often considered as suffering from a volume management problem, which leads to excessive deliveries. Remedying this problem is the objective of the so-called new generation cooperatives. In a supply chain context, however, this problem may actually be beneficial. Specifically, it limits the upstream firm's ability to hold up the downstream firm, which in turn makes possible specific downstream investments that are closer to first best. Our model lends structure to several real-world phenomena, including the apparent success of marketing cooperatives in farming, the success of open-end mutual funds, and the organization of aggregators in the new economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper studies the initial organisation and subsequent transformation of the socio-technical assemblage or ‘agencement’ around wind power in Denmark, focusing on the changing roles and agency of electricity producers. We propose a conceptual model for mapping the transformation over time, following five entangled dimensions: capitalisation instruments, turbine technology, capital investment, regulation of finance and ownership modes. We show how changes in all five socio-material dimensions have produced a ‘paradigm shift’, reconfiguring wind power from a distributed power source to critical infrastructure. This shift has marginalised local players and mobilised new types of producers and ownership forms. Using the conceptual model, we map the controversy resulting from the paradigm shift. Our relational lens of market studies within Science & Technology Studies captures how wind power’s ‘sustainability’ has become contested, and how this cannot be understood as a matter of ‘community acceptance’ dissociated from material factors. Proposing our conceptual model for future studies, we contribute not only to the extant social acceptance literature, but also to critical energy debates on the governance of climate change and sustainability. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Shifting from a linear to a circular economy in the agrifood domain requires innovative business models, including reverse logistics, new visions on customer-supplier relationships, and new forms of organization and marketing strategies at the crossroads of various value chains. This research aims to identify and characterise different types of business models that create value from agricultural waste and by-products via cascading or closing loops. Conceptual and management insights into circular business models are still sparse. In total, 39 cases have been studied that convert agro-waste and by-products into valuable products via a circular economy approach. Semi-structured interviews and on-site visits of six representative cases have been done, and secondary data been collected. Data has been treated with content analysis. Cases are presented according to the type of organisational structure, resources, transformation processes, value propositions, key partners, customers, strategic approaches and innovation. Six types of circular business models are identified and discussed: biogas plant, upcycling entrepreneurship, environmental biorefinery, agricultural cooperative, agropark and support structure. They differ in their way of value creation and organisational form, but strongly depend on partnerships and their capacity to respond to changing external conditions. This study offers the first circular business model typology within the agricultural domain, revealing the interconnectedness of the six different business model types. It provides options for managers in positioning and adapting their business strategies. It highlights the potential of using biomass first for higher added-value products before exploiting it as energy source. Cascading biomass valorisation at a territorial level will increasingly be important for locally cooperating actors within a circular bioeconomy approach. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Accurate and early estimation of citrus yields is important for both producers and agricultural cooperatives to be competitive and make informed decisions when selling their products. Yield estimation is key for predicting stock volumes, avoiding stock ruptures and planning harvesting operations. Visual yield estimations have traditionally been employed, resulting in inaccurate and misleading information. The main goal of this study was to develop an automated image processing methodology to detect, count and estimate the size of citrus fruits on individual trees using deep learning techniques. During 3 consecutive annual campaigns, a total of 20 trees from a commercial citrus grove were monitored using images captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). These trees were harvested manually, and fruit sizes were measured. A Faster R-CNN Deep Learning model was trained using a custom dataset to detect oranges in the obtained images. An average standard error (SE) of 6.59 % was obtained between visual counting and the model's fruit detection. Using the detected fruits, fruit size estimation was also performed. The promising results obtained indicate that this size estimation method can be employed for size discrimination prior to harvest. A model based on Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) was trained for yield estimation per tree and for a total yield estimation. The actual and estimated yields per tree were compared, resulting in an approximate error of SE = 4.53 % and a standard deviation of SD = 0.97 Kg. The actual total yield, the estimated total yield and the total yield estimated by an expert technician were compared. The error in the estimation by the technician was SE = 13.74 %, while the errors in the model were SE = 7.22 % and SD = 4083.58 Kg. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the present technique to provide yield estimates for citrus fruits or even other types of fruit. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the factors influencing the financial performance of 1,766 agricultural cooperatives in Thailand by applying the DuPont analysis framework. Financial performance, measured using ROE (return on equity), was decomposed to three contributing factors, viz., profitability, asset efficiency, and financial leverage. Linear regression and quantile regression analyses were employed to respectively estimate the conditional mean and conditional quantiles. Profitability was found to be the strongest driver of ROE. Asset efficiency and financial leverage were also positive contributors to ROE. An alternative regression model was carried out, where the financial performance construct ROE was replaced with ROA (return on assets). The findings suggest that increasing leverage leads to decreasing performance, contradicting the earlier results. This implies that whether leverage hurts or benefits performance can depend on the variable choice. Employed as control variables, location and age were found to be associated with performance. In particular, the cooperatives in the central region, in general, appeared to have the lowest financial performance. The study empirically pointed out that negative equity led to violations of the ordinal and interpretable properties of ROE. Thus, ROE components should be carefully examined. Regarding cooperative management policy, cooperatives should concentrate on both operating and financial performances with the priority given to profitability, which involves the efficiencies of cost and sales management. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press},

The study shows how poor financial efficiency in credit unions may result from undesirable configurations in executive management and other variables related to governance. Design/methodology/approach: The study develops an innovative methodology to classify credit unions according to the level of governance using indicators of representativeness and participation, leadership, management and supervision. This methodology integrates the use of multiple correspondence and cluster analysis. The study then applies stochastic frontier models to analyze how governance affects the indicators of financial efficiency. Findings: The results highlight that better governance substantially increases the efficiency of credit unions in terms of a higher level of credit operations per institution. Originality/value: The paper uses a pioneering survey applied by the Central Bank to almost the total population of credit unions in Brazil. The results highlight how to operationalize a subjective and broad concept related to cooperative governance to identify the remarkable impacts of good governance practices on the financial efficiency of credit unions. © 2020, Ricardo Terranova Favalli, Alexandre Gori Maia and Jose Maria Ferreira Jardim da Silveira.},

	abstract = {There are repeated calls for the reform of Islamic banking and finance from academic economists. Critics assert that Islamic financial institutions are simply replicating conventional banks and ignoring Sharīʿah teachings. There is a very critical rhetoric on Islamic banking practice, but this is expounded without examining the facts on the ground. In contrast, in this evidence-based investigation the activities of three leading Islamic banks are examined, Al Rajhi Bank, Maybank Islamic, and Meezan Bank. All three are found to have reputable scholars on their Sharīʿah boards to ensure compliance with Islamic law. These institutions are incorporated as listed companies rather than being mutual or co-operative organizations as some Islamic economists advocate. Being a limited liability company ensures they can raise risk capital and conform to international regulations which are enforced by central banks. The three case studies reveal that the banks have been innovative in the deposit facilities offered as well as in their financing methods. Much of their financing is through leasing for vehicle acquisition and residential mortgages. Although focused on retail customers, the banks also provide commercial and investment banking services for companies and finance for small and medium sized enterprises. In summary, far from being broken, Islamic banks provide helpful financing for modern economies. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

The issue could arise where a group of producers of agricultural products gets together to form a cooperative or even where professionals in the same field get together in a partnership. On the face of it, each supply agreement between the producer and the cooperative or partnership is vertical, but the design of the collective rules, which govern for all, involves horizontal coordination. This article takes as the starting point the example of dairy cooperatives as they emerged in the later part of the nineteenth century as a solution to a challenge offered by new technology. We use the landmark contract law case of McEllistrim v. Ballymacelligott Cooperative to illustrate the ways in which competition law could be engaged when cooperatives are formed. Comparisons of Ireland and Denmark in the period leading up to the decision suggest that not only might the restraint be ancillary, but if not, it reduced costs, increased quality, and was welcomed by consumers (though these were in England rather than in Denmark or Ireland). The restraint also appears essential in some form, suggesting that either ancillarity or the application of Art. 101(3) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union would have allowed the restraint to be used. © The Author(s) 2020.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the perception of farmers toward the possibility to develop agricultural cooperatives through subak in an upcoming tourism destination. This study was carried out in Subak Jatiluwih in Bali, Indonesia, which has been designated by the UNESCO as one of the sites that became the World Cultural Heritage. Data were collected through interviews with 70 farmers using a structured questionnaire that was tested previously and through focus group discussion (FGD) during the period of June to August 2018. Perceptions of farmers were reviewed from indicators of knowledge and attitudes and measured using each of the 20 statements using a Likert scale. Data were then analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results show that perceptions of farmers toward the possibility of developing agricultural cooperatives through subak are within good category. When farmers have good perception, it is expected that the process of developing agricultural cooperatives through subak can be realized quickly and synergized with tourism businesses. © 2020, ASERS Publishing House.

Six informants were selected through a purposive sampling method. The findings indicate that the definition of performance revolves around the dimensions of efficiency (i.e. doing things right) and effectiveness (i.e. doing the right things). This operationalisation of the dimensions fits with the identity of cooperatives. Smallholders’ cooperative performance is summarised as the ability to conduct the process of basic management tasks in an efficient and effective manner as well as conform to the expectations of its members. The originality of this study lies in its attempt to investigate the concept of performance using the pragmatic understanding of top management in line with the mental model.

	abstract = {Global trade in niche commodities has increased the influence of consumers' choices on land use change and livelihoods in developing rural areas. New niche commodity markets for fine cocoa—produced by old tree varieties frequently grown in shaded agroforestry systems—create more direct linkages between producers and buyers. We explored the socioeconomic and environmental outcomes for cocoa smallholders that participated in direct trade relations compared with smallholders that sold through mainstream markets. Household interviews were conducted with cocoa smallholders in northern Ecuador. Biodiversity conditions at farm level were monitored for 75% of surveyed households. Using a counterfactual based on genetic matching, we found that smallholders engaged in direct trade (a) captured superior prices for cocoa sales; (b) had greater access to agricultural training, technical assistance, and improved social networks; and (b) applied more nature-friendly management practices, compared with smallholders selling through mainstream markets. However, a strong overlap between direct trading practices and organic certification made attribution of environmental benefits difficult. This overlap likely explained why farmers engaged in direct trade used more organic fertilizers and less herbicide. Shade level and plant species richness and abundance in plantations were unrelated to market participation. Additional qualitative analyses suggest that certification facilitates engagement in direct trade and that some direct buyers request certification. This study provides insights on the potential of developing value chain innovations for high-quality commodity trade. The success of value chain innovations hinges on the competitiveness of farmers' cooperatives and involvement of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private actors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

This research aims to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) of farmers in the GAP-Harran Plain for services that would ensure sustainable agricultural income, the factors affecting their willingness, and the minimum amount they would be willing to pay. The main material of the research has been obtained by means of face-to-face surveys involving farmers selected by a simple random sampling method in the GAP-Harran Plain. The sampling volume was determined with a 95% confidence limit and a 5% error margin. Heckman’s two-stage model was used for the analysis. According to the results of the research, 22.61% of the participants showed WTP, and the average amount they were willing to pay was 180.82 TL/hectare (ha) ($31.86/ha). This amount was 3.08% of the average annual agricultural income calculated. About 41.22% of the participants showed no WTP. They believed that the public sector is accountable of the services and consequently, they should be provided free of charge. About 23.14% of the participants showed WTP only for the services that they needed. The average WTP for all participants was calculated as 40.9 TL/ha ($7.21/ha) and 1.2 million $/year for the GAP-Harran Plain. This amount is the minimum and may increase by several folds with a demand-based variety of service delivery. The factors that statistically effect WTP have been determined as age, education, experience, number of households working in agriculture, amount of land, agricultural income, non-agricultural income, membership status of agricultural cooperatives, and product pattern. The results provide useful information to guide researchers, decision-makers, and policy-makers. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Open-field burning, a widely used treatment and disposal method for rice straw, poses severe health and environmental problems due to the release of toxic gases and loss of significant soil nutrients. Hence, alternative techniques must be explored. In this study, the use of rice straw as feedstock for a downdraft small-scale furnace to produce heated air for paddy drying was investigated. A two-level factorial experiment was initially implemented using differently conditioned rice straw types, rice straw feed rates, and drying airflow rates. Optimization results using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) showed there is no significant difference in the drying air efficiency using either loose or baled straw. The optimum conditions found were at a rice straw feed rate of 20.67 kg h−1 and drying airflow rate of 3.03 m3 s−1, resulting in a drying air efficiency of 86.1%, and an increase in drying air temperature of 18.41 °C which was sufficient for paddy drying applications. At the optimum conditions, the average CO and NOx concentrations measured inside the dryer simulator were 76.57 and 2.93 ppm, respectively. The results of this research can be used for pilot studies in actual agricultural cooperatives, as well as provide inputs to life cycle analysis. © 2019 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In this time of the pandemic, nothing is as it used to be. This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor. A truly resilient global food system implies not only preparedness for coming shocks and changes but also a foundation that makes shocks less probable and critical. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Agricultural cooperatives are seen as an efficient way for smallholder farmers to create bargaining power in order to achieve poverty reduction and food security. However, the success of these cooperatives depends on their ability to maintain their social capital, which is at the core of collective action. A few studies have addressed issues of member participation, commitment, and trust, yet less is known about rural cooperatives in developing countries as a social organization. It is also unclear whether a relationship exists between cooperative size and the incidence of conflict, fraud, and distrust. Using unique data collected from 511 agricultural cooperatives in 12 districts of Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of cooperative size on conflict, fraud, and distrust. We used instrumental variables (IV) probit estimation techniques, accounting for endogeneity of membership size, to confirm that cooperative size does affect the occurrence of conflict, fraud, and trust. The results also indicate that other influencing factors include: cooperative age, number of employees, payment of dividends based on transaction volume, and heterogeneity of member goals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Community-based wildlife conservation (CBWC) programmes have been a pervasive paradigm in the conservation circles since the 1970s. The key elements of such programmes are that local communities are given ownership rights or custodianship and management responsibilities over wildlife, and that they gain social and economic benefits from conservation of the resources. However, to date, there have been only a few studies that offer in-depth analyses of the interplay between governance processes and livelihood impacts of CBWC programmes. Here, I conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions in five wildlife conservancies in the Maasai Mara ecosystem in Kenya to address the following questions: i) What are the perceived impacts of the wildlife conservancies on livelihoods of the local people? ii) To what extent are the wildlife conservancies governed in relation to the principles of environmental governance? I assessed impacts on livelihoods by applying the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to explore perceived conservancy-related benefits and costs (i.e. perceived changes in social, financial, human, physical, and natural capitals). I assessed governance by asking the respondents whether the following eight principles of environmental governance were applied: legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, integration, capability, and adaptability. Perceived benefits of participating in wildlife co-management were identified as: enhanced income from gainful employment and new business opportunities, membership to cooperative societies and participation in community work (e.g. school bursary and feeding programmes), enhanced social relations, improved access to credit and health facilities, enhanced physical infrastructure (schools, roads and bridges), improved physical security and coordinated sharing of provisioning ecosystem services like pasture and water. The principles of legitimacy, inclusiveness, and integration had reportedly been well implemented in wildlife co-management. However, the institutional mechanisms for sharing resources within the conservancies lacked transparency, accountability, and fairness, and tended to favour those who were politically connected to the leadership of the conservancies. Moreover, most of the conservancies had weak systems and few resources to facilitate delivery on responsibilities (i.e. had low capability), and had some costs associated with human-wildlife conflicts. For an improved co-management of wildlife to be achieved in these conservancies, local institutions should be reconfigured to allow active participation by conservancy landowners in decision-making, information sharing, and equitable access to conservancy-related benefits. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sustainable transport is an important way of mitigating climate change. Inland navigation still is a sustainable mode of transport which is of great importance for the whole European transport market. However, due to its market structure, it risks losing the battle for volume and market share with the other transportation modes. Opting for inductive research approach, this paper first of all collects data. Next, the paper observes the market of the European inland navigation sector and looks for patterns in order to develop a set of structural pathways. From the data collection, it turns out that the sector is facing challenges, mainly due to overcapacity, uncontrolled costs and volatile freight prices. The classical reaction pattern to overcome these shortcomings (capacity control, cost control, playing with ‘time’ and ‘reliability’ factors) does no longer suffice. By analyzing the patterns, the researchers were able to formulate five pathways: A first path is that of technological/operational innovation or retrofitting for ecological and social sustainability. A second path is that of industrial economics: inland navigation is marked by a lot of fragmentation. A solution might be pooling up, whereby the risk of anti-competitive impacts seems very low. A third path is that of financing: the classical financing through banks clearly provides no incentive for reducing overcapacity, even not through bankruptcies. Actual lay-up of vessels seems a must. For longer-run financing, bonds, credit unions or even crowd-funding can be solutions. A fourth path builds on the second one, with more co-operation needed within the wider sector, also with vertically-related partners: charterers, terminal operators, etc. Fifth and finally, a dynamic regulation is needed, following modern rules, with an eye on the longer-term viability of the sector. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

There were two guiding questions in this study: How and in what ways women social entrepreneurship are developed in Japan? and What life events affect the values and beliefs that drive them to take authentic entrepreneurial careers for social change? The Solution: We explored the connection between women social entrepreneurship, authentic leadership, and transformative learning theories in the context of Japan through an extensive literature review. The proposed theoretical framework could be used to show the role of critical reflection in face of triggering life events and factors that support or hinder in becoming women social entrepreneurs.

We collected data at the kibbutz level via interviews with community managers and at the individual level through questionnaires among community members in 19 kibbutzim. We employed the “nearest neighbor” methodology to create pairs who were demographically eligible for a before and after comparison. Although our results about perceived sustainability suggest that kibbutzim across the board have overcome the struggle to survive and have been able to recover, unlike commonly assumed, changes they adopted in the direction of more privatization and diversified statuses are clearly correlated with smaller increases in levels of perceived sustainability.

A comprehensive assessment of co-operatives therefore requires an examination of non-conventional factors, in addition to the conventional factors. Three such non-conventional factors identified in the literature are 1)commitment, 2)heterogeneity and 3)social capital. Commitment is important for agricultural co-operatives because one pre-requisite for successful agricultural co-operatives is that farmer-members are willing to supply the co-operative with raw products, capital and managerial inputs. In this research affective, continuance, normative and other aspects of member commitment are examined. Heterogeneity is an important source of concern for co-operatives due to its impact on cohesiveness and collective decision making. This study used characteristics associated with the farmer-member and the farm-business to examine heterogeneity. It has been suggested that the social capital paradigm is the common denominator for all explanations and theories on co-operative formation and development. A modified version of the six dimensions’ framework used by the World Bank to assess social capital was used in this study. Based on this theoretical underpinning, a Three Dimensional Conceptual Framework, that encapsulates commitment, heterogeneity and social capital is developed and described. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This heterogeneity, coupled with a large growth in the number of cooperatives in the country, offers an interesting perspective to study the determinants of the (in)efficiency of cooperatives. In this paper, we analyse the performance of Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives, focusing on the degree of technical (in)efficiency and its determinants. We use the stochastic frontier approach in which we account for heteroskedasticity and the monotonicity of production functions, presenting a methodological improvement with respect to previous technical efficiency studies. The results show that NGO- and government-initiated cooperatives are less efficient than community-initiated ones, implying that governments and NGOs should not interfere too strongly in cooperative formation. Cooperatives with a high degree of heterogeneity in members’ participation are found to be about 98% less efficient, while cooperatives that have paid employees are 33% more efficient. Besides, results show that cooperatives in Ethiopia function more efficiently if they incentivize committee members through monetary compensation. © 2019, © 2019 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

Their rate of infection and production of mycotoxins is mainly influenced by weather and pre-harvest agronomic measures. Consequently, farmers' prevention and control of mycotoxins are imperative since it is difficult to remove mycotoxins further down the cereal supply chain. This study aimed to (i)identify which pre-harvest preventive and control measures Dutch wheat farmers currently apply against Fusarium spp. infection and mycotoxin contamination and to (ii)examine which farm and farmer characteristics explain the implementation of these measures. Field data on pre-harvest measures, like the selection of resistant varieties, fungicide use, and crop rotation, along with farm and farmer characteristics were collected from Dutch wheat farmers via an online questionnaire. Probit models were applied to examine farm and farmer characteristics that explain the implementation of pre-harvest measures. Results showed that most farmers applied six or more different measures against Fusarium spp. infection and mycotoxin contamination in wheat and that the use of pre-harvest measures is related to at least one other measure. However, results indicated that about 44% of farmers could become more effective if they implemented a benchmark approach consisting of a combination of fungicide use during flowering, selection of a Fusarium resistant wheat variety, and plowing or crop rotation. Five out of the ten evaluated farm and farmer characteristics significantly (p < 0.05)explained the implementation of at least one of the eight pre-harvest control measures. These five farm and farmer characteristics include wheat as main income crop, the use of a decision support system, the education level of the farmer, the farmer's knowledge about mycotoxins, and the farmer's level of risk aversion. Insight into relevant characteristics can be used by farmer cooperatives, processing industries and government agencies to improve the overall mycotoxin management of wheat farmers. © 2019 The Authors},

After the initial technological assessment in the laboratory of SAN, the grain was malted in the Department of Agricultural and Food Production Engineering at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Land Management and Environmental Protection of the University of Rzeszow. Moisture, protein content, runoff time, viscosity, pH, wort clarity, extract content and diastatic power were determined in the tested malt, as well as wort obtained from it in the process of mashing. The average parameters of protein content, extractivity of malt ground into flour, of pH and the wort extract were normative, while the other researched parameters did not meet high quality requirements. A high loss of grain mass was noted during malting. After laboratory tests of malt and wort, it was determined that part of the malting raw material is of high malting quality and can be used without modification in the brewhouse for the malting and mashing process.  © 2019 Józef Gorzelany et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) was established in 1997 is a unique sub-regional initiative in Asia. It combines the south and South-East Asia with five countries of SAARC and two countries of ASEAN. BIMSTEC is a sector-driven cooperative organisation with key areas of economic cooperation include trade, investment, regional value chains, energy, connectivity, technology, management and capacity building, people to people contact, among others. Even after two decades of existence, BIMSTEC achieved limited progress as India the largest member of the group showed little interest in it. But the failure of SAARC as an effective sub-regional economic integration in Asia and the incorrigible differences between India and Pakistan, the two largest economies of SAARC led to the rethinking and resurrection of BIMSTEC in the recent past. India's strategic interests in the Himalayan, Bay of Bengal and Mekong sub-regions have grown over the years and the expansionist tendencies of China in these regions led to India's renewed engagements with BIMSTEC. In this context, the paper looks into the trade relation between India and BIMSTEC countries and identified the unexplored trade potential and possible areas of cooperation between India and BIMSTEC countries. The trade impact of the likely India BIMSTEC Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) is ascertained using partial equilibrium simulation model. Indicators such as Trade Intensity Index (TII) and Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) showed hat there is trade complementary existing between India and BIMSTEC countries and the possibility of enhanced economic cooperation between them. The SMART simulation showed that there is trade creation from a potential India BIMSTEC FTA for the participating countries. The simulation analysis also revealed that the total trade effect of India BIMSTEC RTA was 2.369 billion US dollars, total welfare was 267.044 million dollars and the trade creation was 412.2 thousand US dollars. © 2019 The Society of Economics and Development.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance of banking institutions in Costa Rica over the period 2004–2014. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs system GMM, dynamic panel data and traditional financial hypothesis framework to analyze bank performance and assess marketplace sustainability for a sample of commercial and cooperative banks from Costa Rica. In the assessment, the authors visit the relative market power, structure conduct performance (SCP) and efficient structure literature. Findings: Market share (MS) is positively related to performance whereas the authors find a negative effect of market concentration (Herfindahl–Hirschman index) on bank profits, thereby refuting the SCP hypothesis. The authors accept the “quiet life” hypothesis within Costa Rican banks since a moderate level of profit persistence is detected. Commercial banks are less profitable. Yet when crisis is introduced to the models, it has a significant and negative impact on overall bank performance. Research limitations/implications: The authors selected years and banks based on available data plus default information in the relevant database. More insights can be gained from post-2014 developments. Practical implications: The current results and conclusions have implications for developing economies (and economic development, in general) by showing that the traditional understanding of cooperative bank model as better for the public good may not be necessarily true. They offer insight into the understanding of how different bank-type institutions affect the public good. Furthermore, expanding the research to Latin America in order to directly compare commercial and cooperative enterprises via a meta-frontier technique would help buttress this evidence. Originality/value: This is the most recent study to provide such an investigation for a Latin American country with a sizable MS for cooperative and public sector banks. The paper offers analysis that has been limited in Latin American banking markets thus far. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Measuring solvency risk by the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio we find that several factors driving the bank NPL ratio play a more subdued role for MFIs. By contrast, MFI Z-scores, notably those of MFI banks, credit unions and other MFIs, are driven by largely the same factors as bank Z-scores. The difference in results can be linked to the special characteristics of credit technologies pursued by MFIs. Given that the Z-score is the broader risk measure we conclude from our results that larger and deposit taking MFIs should be subject to the same regulatory and supervisory regimes as banks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

This digitalization is characterized by the intensive use of information technologies in the different stages of the value chain of a sector. In this context, smart agriculture is transforming the agricultural sector in terms of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In some countries, cooperatives, as the most common legal form of the incumbent companies, in this rather traditional low-intensive technology sector, are going to develop a relevant role in the process of adoption of these technologies. In this context, this paper provides, first, a review of the evolution of the main digital technologies, such as Internet of Things, robots, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Blockchain, among others. Second, a description of the digital innovation process in agri-cooperatives in order to help them in the decision-making process, and third, a digital diagnosis tool for measuring cooperatives' digital innovation. This tool is initially applied to two cases of agri-cooperatives in Spain. All of this contributes to a better understanding of digitalization of agri-cooperatives in the context of smart agriculture. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Nordic countries Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are among the few European countries where parliamentary democracy survived the challenges of the interwar period. The apparent resilience of Nordic democracy has sometimes been partly attributed to the strength of the popular movements, the internal democratic structures, and culture of these organizations and not least their role in educating their members in democratic practices. Drawing primarily on examples from the co-operative movements in several Nordic countries, the article asks how democracy was understood in co-operative societies and how it functioned in practice. Co-operative societies were committed to the principle of ‘one member one vote’, but faced constant dilemmas over how to combine the possibility for grassroots influence with the need for central control, especially as the organizations grew in size. In some cases, this led to irreconcilable conflicts and splits in central organizations. The article argues that although the co-operatives and other popular movements later came to be seen as crucial elements in the survival of Nordic democracy, their role in this survival should not be taken for granted. © The Author(s) 2019.},

This article therefore aims to contribute to better understanding of the process and practice of seed potato cooperatives’ formation and operation in Chencha, Ethiopia. Our study specifically focused on why and how farmer groups organize, produce and market quality seed potato. We collected primary data from two seed potato cooperatives in three phases through interviews, focus group discussions, and field assessment and store inventories on bacterial wilt incidence. We found that the support to the establishing of the two seed potato cooperatives focused more on improving the members’ seed potato production capacity and less on building good governance in the seed chain. The experiences showed the tensions between prescriptive rules, collective action and individual interests which made it very hard to maintain quality seed standards and friendship at the same time. In general, the root of having weak seed cooperatives may not be the lack of intent towards building durable farmer groups. Rather, development practitioners did not take the set-up of strong farmer groups as an evolving process, which continually engages in diagnosis and responds to the emerging social as well as material challenges. The set-up of farmer-group-based seed production, therefore, needs to shift from ‘standard production models’ to an evolving model: an open and flexible model guided by trials, challenges and existing socio-technical and institutional realities. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, smallholders in farmer cooperatives are unsustainable because of the lack of decision-making power at the grassroots level; limited access to land, capital, technologies, information and financial services; low market competitiveness; weak management; and limited policy and socio-cultural norms. This research aims to construct the behavior model for performance change of cooperative farmers in Rasau Jaya, Kubu Raya district, West Kalimantan. It involved 75 smallholders recruited using purposive sampling technique. In-depth interviews using the structural equation modeling/SEM based on the new institutional approach and the theory of planned behavior were used in the study. The findings proved that intentions and past behaviors have positive and negative influence on farmers' cooperative behavior, but contradicted with control. Therefore, there are several efforts for changing the behavior in corn farmers’cooperatives, i.e. the perceived behavioral control can stimulate the motivation to be long-lived performing based on the resources and opportunities; pro-environmental behavior needs to engage a supportive injunctive norm and a supportive descriptive norm; a subjective norm for motivation to exhibitthe positive experiential attitude; and the confidence to perform and control their performance. © 2021 Ecological Society of India.

	abstract = {How can finance be durably democratized? In the centers of financial power in both the United States and the United Kingdom, proposals now circulate to give workers and the public more say over how flows of credit are allocated. This article examines five democratization proposals: credit union franchises, public investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, inclusive ownership funds, and bank nationalization. It considers how these plans might activate worker and public engagement in decision making about finance by focusing on three modes of public participation: representative democracy, direct democracy, and deliberative minipublics. It then considers the degree to which democratization plans might be resilient to de-democratization threats from business. It argues that of the five, bank nationalization goes furthest in guarding against de-democratization threats but is still pocked with pitfalls if it relies solely on representative democracy. It argues that two criteria appear necessary for democratically durable alternatives: the active direct participation of workers and citizens and the weakening of businesses’ capacity for democratic retrenchment. © The Author(s) 2019.},

The transnational capitalist class has taken setbacks in its stride, while the Left flounders almost everywhere. No communist revolution has resulted in the capture of power by the working class. Now we are all confronted by a new, rapidly unfolding ecological crisis, the Anthropocene. I argue that the most effective response is to exit rather than attempt to overthrow capitalism and the hierarchical state by international revolution. Socialists in positions of authority in state institutions and capitalist enterprises can facilitate this process by enacting legislation that helps people to transition to new smaller-scale non-statist social units, such as producer-consumer co-operatives producing their own food and other essential services over time. Mobilizing the ideas of degrowth, anarching, and consumer-producer cooperatives in the digital age, I argue that under Anthropocene conditions democratic socialism is best constructed from the bottom up, community by community, networked in mutually nurturing relationships. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Banana is an important commercial fruit crop for smallholder farmers in Arba Minch, southern Ethiopia. However, its sector is experiencing many constraints and limited attention given to productivity and marketing. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the banana value chain in order to identify constraints on productivity and marketing, and possibilities of improvements towards a sustainable value chain in Arba Minch. Data were collected through a survey, key informants’ interviews, and focus group discussions. Different analytical and statistical tools were used for data analysis. Results describe actors, supporters, and influencers of the existing banana chain. The current banana chain has three different distribution channels in Arba Minch. The channel that connects with rural consumers has the highest value share for farmers while the channel that includes traveling traders has the lowest value share for farmers. The marketing cooperative channel has an intermediate value share for farmers in the chain. Poor agronomic practice, diseases, pests, and climate change were the major constraints for the banana yield while limited market information, lack of cold store and refrigerated trucks, poor post-harvest handling, lack of alternative markets, and weak capacity of cooperatives were the main constraints for banana marketing in Arba Minch. Economic, social and environmental indicators have a moderate sustainability performance within the Ethiopian context. The chain has an advantage in terms of profitability, employment, emission of air pollutants and constraints in terms of coordination, value share, profit margin, market diversity, product and market information, transportation, waste management, and safety and hygiene. © 2020 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The data set used in this study comes from four SACCOS audited financial reports from the year 2010 to 2014 and from interviews with SACCOS’s management. Findings: The study found that the IMFIs in Tanzania are not financially sustainable. Additionally, having responsible staff members, regular review of financial guidelines, education to members, cooperation between employees and management and staff training are found to be highly contributing factors towards SACCOS’s financial sustainability. Moreover, the findings reveal that depending on the single source of income, i.e., charges on members contributed much in these SACCOS’s not being financially sustainable. Research limitations/implications: Only two available registered Islamic SACCOS was used. Additionally, conventional SACCOS have been in service provision for a long time as compared to Islamic ones; hence, caution must be taken for comparison purposes. Practical implications: Based on these findings, the Islamic SACCOS needs to initiate productive projects that can enable them to have other income sources apart from charges on members. Originality/value: This study traces the financial trend of Islamic SACCOS in Tanzania since its establishment in 2010. Such trace enables Islamic SACCOS and other stakeholders to be aware on the financial progress of Islamic SACCOS and act accordingly to ensure sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Mariculture Sci-Tech parks promote modern mariculture and help improve China's mariculture industry. A park consists of a core area and a radiation area. The core area includes a farm, a cooperative, or a company, and the radiation area consists of many small farmers. Stochastic frontier analysis is employed to analyze the performance and its influencing factors of different governance structures in mariculture Sci-Tech parks. Results indicated the following: 1) Core areas show diminishing returns of scale, indicating that the increase in the scale of mariculture production can decrease the output. 2) The average technical efficiency of the core area is 0.4728, with the large family farms having the highest (0.4907), followed by the mariculture companies (0.4777) and the fish farmer cooperatives (0.4499). Several reasons can explain the difference in technical efficiency. First, family farms can better apply the new technology and new varieties to the mariculture production through moderate scale management. Second, companies have a higher operating cost, and the construction of mariculture Sci-Tech park has little effect on companies' performance. Third, cooperatives' advantage is not obvious in the organization management and the repeated construction of the infrastructure decreases utilization. 3) When the radiation area is considered, the input of large family farms has the most significant impact on the performance of the entire Sci-Tech park, with the highest driving efficiency. However, the cooperatives' driving efficiency is very poor, and the company performance is only reflected in the capital investment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses firm-level data from CoBank, the primary lender to agricultural cooperatives, to evaluate optimizing behavior of 77 Midwestern agricultural marketing and supply cooperatives from 2014 through 2017. The study uses the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the weak axioms of cost minimization and profit maximization to identify whether or not a cooperative is following a cost minimization and/or profit maximization objective. Findings: In contrast to previous research, results provide stronger support for profit maximization as the behavioral objective of agricultural cooperatives instead of cost minimization, especially for larger cooperatives. Practical implications: Traditional firm theory for investor-owned firms states that businesses seek to maximize profits. Agricultural cooperatives however, could aim to maximize profits so as to redistribute profits back to user-owners as patronage refunds. Or, they could minimize costs so as to lower cost of products sold and services provided to their user-owners. Given users-control the cooperative, knowing the primary objective of agricultural cooperatives will allow for better design of research and education programming. Originality/value: Given recent changes and consolidation in the agricultural industry among farms and agricultural cooperatives, this study reexamines past work that evaluated the optimizing behavior of agricultural cooperatives. Changes in industry and the necessity to remain competitive from an agribusiness standpoint have resulted in an anticipated shift toward a profit maximizing objective. The value of this study is providing an evaluation framework, using a firm-level comprehensive dataset, that represents the cooperative system. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The exponential increase in anthropogenic activities has led to the accumulation of xenobiotics into the environment, synthetic dyes being one of the culprits. Noteworthy is the fact that the textile industry utilizes enormous volumes of water for dyeing and printing unit operations thereby generating wastewater proportionately. Taking into consideration, implications of toxic textile effluents, a pilot study was planned to screen for naturally attenuated bacterial isolates capable of degrading textile effluents. Requisite effluent samples were collected from Kelki Printers Co-operative Society Limited, Sanganer, Jaipur and bacterial screening was carried out by bioaccumulation of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBRR) (formation of halo around colonies). Of the 19 bacterial isolates obtained, the most promiscuous isolate was biochemically characterized as Enterobacter sp. For biodegradative investigations, it was inoculated in sterilized textile effluent and incubated at 37°C for 7 days under agitating conditions. Pre and post bacterial inoculation (1% v/v), Physico-chemical parameters were analysed following standard procedures. A significant (p<0.05) lowering of pollution indicators was monitored when contrasted with abiotic control. The present study was aimed to explore the role of naturally attenuated and effluent adapted Enterobacter sp. screened from untreated textile effluent based on its colour (RBRR) removal efficacy under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, it was also explored for its biodegradative properties to minimize the level of potential pollution indicators through the microcosm approach. This pilot study based on a three-tier approach encompassing bioprospecting, bio enrichment and bioaugmentation plausibly provided insights for enhanced degradation of real dye wastewaters by unlocking the biochemical pathways of adapted microbes. © 2020 Technoscience Publications.

The involvement of more cooperative societies in the multiplication and sales of stems should be encouraged. Integration of information and supply of various inputs is necessary. A group approach to extension delivery should be further promoted and the use of existing and new cultivars should be made popular through an extended or expanded cassava multiplication programme. Effective strategies are needed for stakeholders to share their experiences with those of other countries of the sub region who are participating in the processing of cassava.

The analysis of the population of these acquisitions spans the paths of annual differences in CAMEL ratios. Most acquirers have a somewhat revised capital structure and are often benefiting from economies of scope, as well as economies of scale. Since their acquisitions, the acquiring credit unions have become less risky, measured by simulated CAMEL ratios, and they are lending a larger share of their deposits. There is no apparent financial reason to discourage credit unions from acquiring additional banks and savings institutions. The National Credit Union Administration does not need to be particularly hesitant to allow credit unions to acquire banks and thrifts. Design/methodology/approach: Financial analysis is done via simulated CAMEL ratios. Findings: After acquiring banks, credit unions are less risky and lend a greater share of their deposits. Research limitations/implications: The study analyzes the population of the credit unions that have acquired banks since 2012, but the population consists of 14 banks acquiring 16 credit unions.

	abstract = {Tasar culture is a traditional practice of local tribes in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha since time immemorial. Traditionally, they used to collect tasar cocoons from forest, keep them for moth emergence, mating and subsequently reared silkworm on forest based Asan or Arjun trees. Gradually, through research intervention economic plantations of host plants, tasar silkworm egg production and rearing methods were introduced. Simultaneously, Tasar Rearers' Cooperative Societies (TRCS), a unique system was developed in Odisha. However, for the production of basic eggs there was dependence on Central Silk Board (CSB). To make the farmers self sufficient in egg production and enhancing the cocoon production, CSB introduced Vanya Cluster Promotion Programme (VCPP) in two areas of Mayurbhanj, viz., Baincha-Jalghati and Thakurmunda-Kendujuani- Mahuldiha Vanya Clusters from 2016-17. A total of 160 farmers comprising of seed (egg) rearers, graineurs (egg producers) and commercial rearers were selected for study. They were trained in different technologies of tasar culture especially in the areas of plantation raising, maintenance, young and late age silkworm rearing, control of pest, predators and diseases of silkworm, egg production. Literacy rate is also very low with 37.5% illiterate and 31.25 were below primary level. However, the technology adoption level by farmers is about 80%.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on farmers’ decisions to adopt integrated pest management (IPM) technology and to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on farm economic performance. Design/methodology/approach: An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used. Findings: The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers’ IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. Practical implications: The findings indicate that agricultural cooperatives can be a transmission route in the efforts to proliferate the adoption and diffusion of IPM technology, and increased IPM adoption tends to improve the economic performance of farm households. Originality/value: Despite the widespread evidence of health and environmental benefits associated with IPM technology, the adoption rate of this technology remains significantly low. This paper provides a first attempt by investigating to what extent and how agricultural cooperative membership affects IPM adoption and how IPM adoption influences farm economic performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper aims to propose the combined use of credit scoring and profit scoring to increase the effectiveness of the loan-granting process in credit unions. Design/methodology/approach: This sample is composed by the data of personal loans transactions of a Brazilian credit union. Findings: The analysis reveals that the use of statistical methods improves significantly the predictability of default when compared to the use of subjective techniques and the superiority of the random forests model in estimating credit scoring and profit scoring when compared to logit and ordinary least squares method (OLS) regression. The study also illustrates how both analyses can be used jointly for more effective decision-making. Originality/value: Replacing subjective analysis with objective credit analysis using deterministic models will benefit Brazilian credit unions. The credit decision will be based on the input variables and on clear criteria, turning the decision-making process impartial. The joint use of credit scoring and profit scoring allows granting credit for the clients with the highest potential to pay debt obligation and, at the same time, to certify that the transaction profitability meets the goals of the organization: to be sustainable and to provide loans and investment opportunities at attractive rates to members. © 2019, Daniel Abreu Vasconcellos de Paula, Rinaldo Artes, Fabio Ayres and Andrea Maria Accioly Fonseca Minardi.},

A response by working-class communities to the devastating effects of globalisation, rapid de-industrialisation, and mass unemployment, the theatres were a contribution to local and national campaigns. The essay sets out the political and social context in which the theatres arose, beginning with the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of a Conservative government in 1979. The key themes of what came to be known as Thatcherism, defined by a focus on free market economics, de-regulation, and attacks on trade unions and local government powers, are then detailed. These attacks gave rise to national and local resistance in the forms of strikes and campaigns, which provided the context for the emergence of Manor Campaign Theatre, the first of the tenants’ groups. The main body of the essay offers a narrative of the tenants’ theatres, their processes and organisation, and their role within campaigns around housing, welfare, credit unions, and water poverty. The conclusion connects these struggles with current injustices, sourced in the still-unfolding impacts of Thatcherism. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Small unsophisticated banks and credit unions are expected to now perform an internal risk assessment. An abundance of information is available on risk assessment, but small institutions remain challenged in finding a turnkey document that is readily actionable to stimulate a less arduous undertaking, especially given the institutions’ limited resources. Research limitations/implications: The setting reflects small deposit-taking institutions with traditional services. It is tailored for easy understanding and practical use by the institutions.

This paper aims to offer an assessment of the record of the British consumer co-operative movement’s efforts to abide by and promote its values and principles during the first 137 years of its existence (1863 to 1990). Design/methodology/approach: The paper is developed using largely qualitative research methods and a variety of sources. These include archival resources and business-historical materials such as committee minutes and correspondence. These materials have been complemented by several semi-structured recorded interviews with senior members of the Co-operative Group. Findings: The authors develop several conclusions. First, where ethical choices were possible and no serious commercial interests were impaired, the co-operative movement could and usually did do its best to adhere to its principles. Second, in several instances, commercial interests did frequently trump ideals. Finally, the organisational structure of the movement made it very difficult to ensure that co-operative principles and values were adhered to. Originality/value: This paper presents a unique case-study that examines the inherent tension between commerce and ethics in the co-operative movement. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The paper analyzes the relationship between remittances and financial development using Kenyan quarterly data from 2006 to 2016. Five different indicators of financial development are used: credit to the private sector as a share of GDP, the number of mobile transactions, the value of these mobile transactions, the number of mobile agents, and the number of bank accounts. The results from using an autoregressive distributed lag demonstrate a strong, positive relationship between remittances and financial development in long-run equations. This suggests that higher levels of remittances provide opportunities for recipients to open bank accounts, enhance their savings, and access financial systems, in addition to exposing the previously unbanked to both new and existing financial products. The results also confirm the potential advantage of embracing modern and advanced technology to facilitate international mobile transfers. Using international remittance transfers through mobile technology reduces costs by eliminating the need for physical branches and personnel to attend to walk-in customers. Aside from offering convenience and safety for remittance actors, this method also dominates traditional remittance business models. Therefore, a policy window exists for the government to leverage on remittances as a tool of financial inclusion and depth, and particularly through the continued expansion of regulatory space to accommodate the wider use of international mobile remittance transfer channels. Moreover, given the strong, positive relationship between remittances and credit to the private sector as indicated by its share of GDP and number of bank accounts, commercial banks and other players in the remittance market may also find it useful to develop customized products for migrants to access their remittances. For example, financial intermediaries can consider providing better deposit interest rates for diaspora deposits compared to deposits made in the local currency. Further, these institutions can allow regular remittance flows to act as collateral for the allocation of credit, among other incentives to tap into the significant potential of money remitted by migrants to Kenya. The study also recommends that the government consider expanding exploitation of diaspora bonds and diaspora savings and credit cooperative societies while drawing lessons from other countries’ previous attempts. © 2019, The Author(s).},

In this regard, there has been an increasing interest in the local food supply of cities and their surrounding regions, as local food is considered to be a contributing factor toward more sustainable, resilient and just urban food systems. Based on this background, a roadmapping process was conducted to assess the status quo and to identify measures to enhance the local food supply in the city-region of Graz in Austria. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 47 stakeholders, analysed textual materials and calculated food carrying capacities. The obtained data served as input for a series of three workshops, where measures were derived. Our results suggest that cooperation among agri-food stakeholders should be facilitated by local decision makers in order to promote food from regional sources within the target area. Furthermore, smart technologies can help to scale-up local food supply schemes, and to track down food stocks and flows more efficiently. Besides, food policy councils and open food labs can help to incubate food product innovations and to support partnerships among agri-food stakeholders, including local small-scale farmers. In the future, engagement and empowerment processes with local food stakeholders should be addressed to enable transformational processes. Roadmaps can help to initiate such processes. © 2019 by the authors.},

We analyse their current role by investigating the characteristics of farmers who continue delivering to them and price differentials between cooperatives and investor-oriented firms (IOFs). A probit regression model applied to 917 farmers suggests that cooperative farmers are more disadvantaged than farmers delivering to IOFs in terms of education, farm size and productive technology. Moreover, t-tests applied to data representing 70 per cent of national volume indicate that farmers delivering to cooperatives are between 11 per cent and 29 per cent smaller than those delivering to IOFs, depending on province. A hierarchical multilevel regression model applied to 9,720 transactions among farmers and processors shows that, after controlling for quantity and quality, cooperatives pay lower (3.5%) but more stable prices than IOFs. In a context of rapid structural change, we observe a market in which larger farmers deliver to IOFs and smaller farmers deliver to cooperatives and conclude that, at the expense of paying lower prices, cooperatives may act as buyers of last resort for otherwise disadvantaged farmers. © 2019 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2019 CIRIEC},

But in cooperative decision making and the acquisition of leadership positions women are often marginalized. It has been argued that women-only groups may help to counter this problem. They may increase women's active participation and, thereby, increase the benefits of cooperative membership. This paper reviews relevant literature and studies the effect of gender homogeneity on women's active participation. We apply a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to a sample of ten Indian village-level dairy cooperatives. The results from our comparative case study confirm that gender homogeneity is not a sufficient means to ensure active participation. It is only in combination with other factors, that women-only groups can enhance women's participation.

Based on a sample of 12 officials from diverse organizations and 234 farmers living nearby the park, the results revealed that agricultural production received supports from both public and private sectors, including communal agricultural board (CAB), communal agricultural cooperative (CAC), XTNP management board, irrigation companies, and input dealers. There were huge differences in advisory flows, methods, and effectiveness according to types of AAS providers and production systems. Rice production received more technology transferred from CAC, CAB and irrigation companies as compared to aquaculture farming. Meanwhile, aquaculture sectors obtained more consultation from input dealers. Among public sectors, XTNP’s managers were partly responsible for raising awareness of environmental protection of the inhabitants but this organization has a small role in the agricultural development of peripheral communities. © 2020 Asian Economic and Social Society.

	abstract = {The need for Romanian agriculture development by efficient usage of resources and a rural environment has led to the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. Romania needs strong cooperatives and, in order to achieve this, the involvement of not only the authorities and agricultural producers, but also of each inhabitant from the rural area, is required. In the context of food market saturation with import products, it is necessary to revive the Romanian market in order to supply natural and quality products. A total of 1425 agricultural cooperatives were registered in Romania at the end of 2018, out of which 57% did not submit the Balance Sheet. The research performed within the study proposes the usage of fsQCA analysis in order to assess some conditions considered by us essential for the sustainability of the agricultural cooperatives. These conditions are represented by the initial contribution of the members, by the existence of a central collection space, by the employment of a manager, by the knowledge of the members on the development possibilities, and by the involvement of the members within the cooperative's activity. The study highlights the fact that the absence of the conditions presented leads to the absence of a sustainable cooperative. We consider the dissolution of the cooperatives pertinent, which has not developed an activity for more than three years from their establishment and the publication on the MADR website of the National Registry of Cooperatives, which will offer a true image on the prosperity and viability of these types of entities. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Tax derives from subjects’ earnings measured in monetary terms, a principle anchored in financial accounting. The canon of equity, especially the vertical form, sometimes referred to as “ability to pay” remains monetary. However, negating conventional horizontal equity, equal taxable incomes often require employment of different economic rationality levels to earn them depending on the profession or sector the tax payer comes from; hence different cognitive energies are required to generate the same taxable income—disapproving the mere “ability to pay” paradigm. From the Gamma Rationality Measure for the credit unions sector that comprises 67% of Kenyan economic livelihoods and using a combination of econometric and Riemann double integral methods, the income consumption rationality function is derived, from which a Cogni-economic Pressure Coefficient is generated for each income level. The coefficient is used to work out a more equitable tax structure from a continuous progressivity tax model, for greater equity, incidentally securing a boost to productivity and economy canons of tax administration—a global lesson, specific for Kenya. © 2020 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: This research was based on the case study method, combined with ethnographic interviews and document analysis. Findings: The findings showed that the industry was highly successful economically, enabling the management to strengthen its authority without sharing information. The decision-making process, thus, became authoritarian, while the community's democratic mechanism was only nominal. This change was also accomplished by cultural transition from cooperative toward more capitalistic values. Management preferred to hire professional workers from the outside without any preference for kibbutz members, causing ethical dilemmas for certain elderly kibbutz members, who felt that the factory had abandoned socialistic ideas. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted only on one kibbutz industry; further research is recommended. Practical implications: Management at cooperative organizations needs to realize that in a capitalistic environment, adaptation can cause the organization to lose its cooperative features. To prevent a cultural shift toward capitalistic values, managers need to be socialized and workers persuaded of the importance of cooperative values. Originality/value: The study is innovative for its focus on loss of cooperative community and managerial style that has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. This research sheds light on organizational conditions that can cause cooperative communities to lose their democratic and socialistic attributes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Rural regions—networks of adjacent communities—having secured a special privileged status of community administration—were organised as a local production system designed to produce specific agricultural or craft products which were then destined for international markets. The present paper aims, first, to bring to light the Greek guild, its internal organization and its geographical impacts; and, second, to investigate the phenomenon of the cooperative community networks. In particular, it presents successful historical examples of cooperative organization, their deeper values and operational rules developed in Eastern Mediterranean during the post-Byzantine period. At the same time, it aims at the study and prominence of the deeper values and motives and main operational rules, firstly on regional micro-level of professional guilds and latterly on a peripheral macro-level of cooperative forms in between in the wider regions of Greek territory. Four historically successful cases of cooperative organization in the Greek territory thrived during the Ottoman occupation, aspects of which offer useful proposals for the founding and operation of today’s cooperative initiatives. The success of these cases is in line with the exploitation of specific political and socio-economic conditions; the parallel growth of an expansive, international commercial network; monopolies’ function; and the invention of innovative operation rules of cooperative organization. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Further, empirical assessment of borrowing pattern of small-scale fishers is conducted by taking the case of ring seiners who constitute an important segment in the local fishery. The main determinants of their borrowing behavior from institutional credit sources are identified using a fractional logit regression approach. The findings point to continuing dominance of the informal financial sector over the institutional credit sector.

Currently, local products from small-scale farms and national branded products with a relatively large scale of production are being registered using GI schemes. Considering the relationships among GI products, their agricultural landscapes, and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), as a GI case study, we examined small GI farms in Odate City, Akita Prefecture, Japan, which produce edible plants called Tonburi. This research explored the complex cause-effect relationship between TEK and landscapes and found that the TEK of Tonburi production influenced biological diversity and vice versa. The TEK and skills of small farmers were confined to the family members of each farmer and were not shared at the community level until GI registration. However, the farmers shared their TEK of sustainable agricultural landscape management through the process of GI registration. Through negotiation between local agricultural cooperatives and farmers, TEK was provided as a form of cultural capital and shared with new producers after GI registration. We concluded that enclosed TEK negatively affects production maintenance and landscape management in the long term. However, the GI registration process contributes to the sharing of TEK as a form of cultural capital among Tonburi farmers. © 2019},

	abstract = {This article analyses new supply chain management (SCM) strategies of the largest retail distribution chains in Europe within the context of differing sustainability concepts and approaches. An analysis is carried out of the strategic plans of such retailers, as well as recent developments in the sector. We begin by identifying the priority actions of retailers and then evaluating, by means of a survey, how small horticultural marketing firms (mainly cooperatives) in southeast Spain respond to the needs of these retailers. Subsequently, an analysis is carried out on these small marketing firm exporters to identify the relative weight which they assign to the variables assessed, while also considering the existing relationships between said weighted variables and business profits. Our results show that retailers tend to establish more simplified supply chains (that is, shorter and more vertical), essentially demonstrating their interpretation of a sustainable supply chain. In contrast, horticultural marketing firms have concentrated more on tactical and operational issues, thereby neglecting environmental, social and logistics management. Thus, their success rate in meeting the sustainability demands of their customers can be considered medium-low, requiring a more proactive attitude. Improved and collaborative relations, and the integration of sustainability concepts between suppliers (marketing firms) and their clients could contribute to successfully meeting sustainability demands. From the point of view of the consumer, close supplier-retail relationships have solved food safety issues, but the implementation of sustainability in other supply chain activities and processes is a pending issue. We propose strategic approximation and collaboration to bridge the gap between the varying sustainability demands in the supplier-retail relationship within perishable supply chains. Although this article specifically addresses fresh vegetable supply chains, the results may be extrapolated to other agri-food chains with a similar structure. © 2019 by the authors.},

This article uses data from 51 interviews with supply chain stakeholders and a survey of 110 smallholder vegetable farmers in Nicaragua to investigate the impact of cooperative-supermarket supply chain relationships on cooperatives, and the role retailers and NGOs play in facilitating these relationships. The study found that in Nicaragua, cooperatives selling to Walmart became unstable, in contrast with the performance of cooperatives selling to local supermarket chain La Colonia. The results show that cooperative performance is impacted by an interaction between differences in the types of farmers reached by the two supermarket chains, in the performance of the NGOs involved in each supply chain, and in the supermarkets’ business practices. The findings suggest that NGOs should pay more attention to buyer sourcing strategies and farmer needs when designing development interventions to link cooperatives of resource-poor farmers to markets, so as not to increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

Multiproduct scale and scope economies are found that suggests increasing scale and product diversification can reduce cost for agricultural cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives experience economies of scale indicating that variable returns to scale as opposed to constant returns to scale is the appropriate technology for modeling agricultural cooperatives. Product-specific scale economies for all outputs are close to one indicating that individual outputs are operating close to constant returns to scale. Annual frontier estimates show that cooperatives have become less cost efficient over time, but scale and scope economies remain relatively consistent across years. Further, results show that economic measures obtained from the single frontier are statistically different from those measures calculated from annual frontiers, suggesting that the cost frontier has shifted over time. The trade-off between cost efficiency and multiproduct scale economies indicates that smaller cooperatives can reduce a higher percentage of cost by increasing the scale of operations rather than just becoming cost efficient. Because larger incentives exist for small cooperatives to increase scale, mergers will likely continue until economies of scale are exhausted in the industry. © 2019 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

	abstract = {Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth following the 1994 Genocide. This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural sector, specifically farming intensification and the government’s focus on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda’s economic development has been impressive, many academics have argued that Rwanda’s growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions as well as sustainable economic development. © 2019, The Author(s).},

In a low-interest rate environment, this effect may be even stronger as financial institutions try to “reach for yield”. In this paper, we use the 2008 introduction of unlimited deposit insurance for all credit unions in the province of British Columbia, Canada, to examine the effect of government guarantees on financial institutions’ earnings uncertainty. We find that the policy change resulted in an economically and statistically significant decrease in earnings uncertainty. In addition, although deposits grew following the policy change, lending did not increase and instead capitalization ratios improved. Overall, our results suggest that the provincial government guarantee boosted depositor confidence and increased the flow of funds to the insured financial institutions. We do not find support for the risk-taking hypothesis but instead show that risk management improved following the policy change. Finally, the effect of the policy change was stronger for smaller, more levered credit unions as well as those with fewer members and smaller market share. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper investigates how food supply chains (SCs) introduce sustainability standards (i.e. organic and/or Fair Trade labels). The authors combined the concepts of power and dependence with types of governance mechanisms to analyse for-profit and cooperative organisations. The authors explored nuances of how lead organisations are spreading sustainability standards. Design/methodology/approach: Four cashew nut and honey SCs were investigated as case studies in Brazil, with data gathered through 15 interviews, secondary data and field visits. Data were examined through a content analysis process following a combined deductive and inductive approach. Findings: Sustainability is spread driven by market pressure, mainly through the diffusion of technical information, either by lead organisations enablers or inter-organisational relations. The authors found that the type and structure of organisations impact the source of power (mediated or non-mediated) and level of mutual dependence between buyer and supplier. For instance, suppliers that hold a strategic position use direct governance mechanisms, which, in turn, lessens the power imbalance in regard to the lead organisation. The authors found in the analysis, a close relation between governance mechanisms and the spread of sustainability, which is ultimately based on strong SC relationships. Practical implications: By recognising their role and the contingencies in spreading sustainability standards along the SC, managers of lead organisations can better design their relationships as well as create strategies to increase their supply chain sustainability (SCS) performance. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the underexplored issue of how sustainability standards are spread throughout SCs in Latin America. Also, it shows how different types of SC rely on governance mechanisms that foster SCS. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In South Africa, cooperatives are the primary institutions through which delivery of governmental agricultural support programmes for rural communities is realised. Although these cooperatives are governed by clear national guidelines that encourage transparency and accountability to their membership, in reality their ability to realise this may be compromised by an imperative to achieve service delivery in an environment of limited governmental support. Drawing on empirical research undertaken at five agricultural cooperatives in the Elliot area of Eastern Cape Province, we examine the extent to which they are able to balance democratic function with effective programme delivery. We show that the limited capacity of local government to reach out to rural areas promotes heavy competition between cooperatives for government programmes, resulting in a highly skewed distribution of benefits determined primarily by how effectively each can ‘reach up’ to local service providers to secure them. This encourages cooperatives to elect powerful actors to represent them because they are perceived to have the greater political ‘connectedness’ required to access these benefits. However, these powerful actors are often less accountable to membership and therefore more likely to disburse benefits to suit their own vested interests. We suggest that, under current conditions, the process of creating effective and legitimate cooperatives must balance strong leadership with a high degree of accountability and transparency to ensure that benefits are disbursed as widely and appropriately as possible to members. Separating executive, judicial and legislative power structures associated with the securing and disbursement of resources to ensure processes are transparent, might be the most practical way of achieving this. Ultimately, if the capacity of the state is strengthened to enable them to ‘reach down’ to cooperatives more effectively, the need to vest leadership in powerful actors and risk compromising accountability and egalitarian service delivery, might be reduced. © 2020 The Author(s).},

The results of the study witnessed that the Central Agricultural University, Imphal, the Department of Agriculture, Manipur and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare had high power and high interest in all the three districts along with Krishi Vigyan Kendra Imphal East, Krishi Vigyan Kendra Thoubal and the Regional Rice Research Station in Imphal East and Thoubal districts respectively.

The Media comprising mainly of the All India Radio, Doordarshan Television and the local newspaper Sangai express has very low interest as well as power in all the three districts.

	abstract = {In recent years, labor-intensive agricultural products from developing countries have exhibited inferior performance in international trade due to quality and safety incidents, among which pesticide residue is a major issue. Aiming to improve food quality and safety in the context of cooperatives, we introduced three categories of control measures: outcome control, process control and social control. Based on the Pre-Harvest Interval Standard (PHIS), we selected three indices, farmers’ implementation rate of PHIS, absolute distance to PHIS and relative distance to PHIS, to evaluate appropriateness of pesticides use, reduction of pesticide residue and safety improvements of agricultural products. By using random sampling survey data, we empirically analyzed the marginal effects of control measures and their combinations on food quality and safety standards. The empirical results show that implementing process control, namely, unified production standards or supply of unified agricultural inputs, can comprehensively improve farmers’ implementation rate of PHIS, absolute distance and relative distance to PHIS respectively by 34.9%, 3.2 days and 46.0% on average. While the effects of outcome control (safety inspection) and social control (bonus-penalty incentive or training) are restricted to other measures. Therefore, we suggest cooperatives should take farmers’ features, implementation conditions and the effects of control measures into consideration in order to make a sustainable management plan for improving food quality and safety and enhancing competitiveness in international markets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Like Robinson, Sklair is critical of Amin's state-centrism, and he sees the international system of hierarchical states: “The power of capitalist hegemony today is so overwhelming (allied as it is with the military and police powers of states) that the only viable strategy for change is by a process of negating, avoiding, and eventually consigning capitalism and the state to the dustbin of history.” He argues that, “Putting all our energies into world socialist revolution” (as Amin argues) “seems increasingly like a self-defeating strategy.” For Sklair, “[t]he only way out of this mess, the only chance of having a liveable planet for the generations to come …is to organise for small-scale socialist communities to create new forms of less destructive and hierarchical economy and society.” He envisions a project of locally-grounded “anarching,” where autonomous producer-consumer cooperatives (P-CCs) advance a “double strategy” that serves to “slow down capitalism” and to “bring into existence a new mode of production based on the different principles and [new] mentalities.” “[A] reconstructed political community could create more genuinely democratizing forms of economic, social, and political organization to encourage and facilitate networks of P-CCs [and…t]he transition from the present capitalist-statist hegemony to the new form of society. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Using a mixed logit model, results revealed that consumer willingness to pay for organic tomatoes was higher than that for tomatoes labeled as Green or Generally Regarded as Safe (GRS). With regard to brands, consumers prefer brands affiliated with proprietary enterprises over brands held by agricultural cooperatives. The interactions between organic label and brands as well as that between Green label and brands were significantly positive suggesting synergy between these labels and brands. Conversely, the interaction between the GRS label and brands was insignificant.

We analyze documents, fieldwork interviews from twenty-eight actors, and observation of events in Barcelona, Paris, and Berlin during 2015–2017. We find that there are three dominant ideological strands: “sharing economy,” “commons,” and “platform cooperativism,” within a spectrum that ranges from legitimizing neoliberalism and/or reasserting a reformist, more humane capitalism to more radical visions: cooperative society to commons-oriented production, and resisting privatization, through the recapturing of public space as commons. The actors we interviewed can be seen as part of an intermediate class, dependent on platforms for their survival, and who end up involuntary promoters of their own alienation and exploitation, consolidating the deterioration of the very digital labor conditions they seek to transform. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Specifically, it examines the effect that gender diversity on the board exerts on returns, debt level, and economic risk. Cooperatives differ significantly from investor-owned firms because cooperative members are producers, agents, and customers of the cooperatives. In Spain, there is an ongoing debate about the importance of women in business management. Spain is also a pioneer in terms of enacting specific legislation for the social economy. The sample examined includes 672 agricultural cooperatives. The results show that firms with greater female representation on their boards have higher returns and operational risk and lower levels of debt.

	abstract = {In the contemporary world history, rural communities and small producers did not naturally disappear due to the loss of economic competitiveness, but were artificially constrained and destroyed by the state laws, institutions, and policies. South Korea, which is considered a representative success case of the late capitalist industrialization after the World War II, can be an important example to examine the relevance of this challenging perspective. Korea’s economic success was largely determined by the NACF (National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation) lack of integrity: it was to be a voluntary and autonomous organization of farmers, but became a subordinate partner of the agricultural policy of the military government. The Saemaul (New Country) Movement developed by the government to promote rural innovations actually accelerated the decline of agriculture for it was used to control farmers. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Korean rural society was deeply dependent on the state power. At the same time, the farmers resistance developed as a reaction to the military government policies, and the NACF became the target of the farmers collective resistance movement. Thus, under the Park Chung Hee’s regime, Korean farmers were to participate in the national economy and become a part of the mandatory social-economic movement; however, they never managed to achieve a true class/collective political representation. © 2020, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

	abstract = {Since development agencies often implement interventions through collective-action groups such as farmer cooperatives and self-help groups, there is a need to understand how participation is affected by group-level and leader attributes. This study collected gender-disaggregated, quantitative and qualitative data on sixty-eight self-help groups in Zambia to understand the participation of men and women farmers in different crop-production activities. Results show that participation rates of men and women are the same across all maize production activities except harvesting. The gender composition of members influenced men’s and women’s participation in group activities: when men were fewer in a group, they (men) participated more, while when more women were in a group (above 53 percent), the women participated less. Leader’s education level, knowledge of group agenda, and frequency of meetings also affected participation rates. To design collective action groups that promote gender equity outcomes, gender composition of groups should be considered. HIGHLIGHTS Agricultural collective-action groups assembled by development organizations attempt to bolster women’s participation and leadership within the group and the community. These empowerment groups may inadvertently reproduce traditional gender labor roles, particularly when membership increases women’s workload. Attention to group dynamics demonstrates that minority group members–who are usually men–work harder and overperform due to their increased visibility within the group. Thus, increasing women’s numbers in groups has not aided the goal of increasing their participation. Policymakers should consider the gender composition of the group, labor roles, time commitment of participation, and leader attributes when forming collective-action groups in order to achieve gender-equity outcomes. © 2020 IAFFE.},

Since the operational cycle of these organizations demands a positive net working capital that is usually funded by debt, the authors examine whether this rise in sales was obtained at the cost of the short-term financial sustainability. As a matter of comparison, the authors conduct the same analysis for Brazilian agricultural public traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ the dynamic analysis of working capital method to measure the short-term financial sustainability of these organizations. Findings: The authors find that the expansion of net working capital caused by the growth of the revenues of the sampled cooperatives was mostly funded by short-term debt, which rose by 31% in annualized terms. The authors also document that around 60% of these firms displayed a current capital structure that can be considered risky in terms of indebtedness, and that the majority of firms exhibited a non-sustainable growth in the period, what contrasts with the performance presented by Brazilian agricultural publicly traded companies, since only 16% of the firms from this group have shown a non-sustainable growth. This distinction seems to be explained by the lower capacity of agricultural cooperatives to provide resources from their operations. Originality/value: The authors investigate the short-term financial sustainability of a unique dataset of 65 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives and provide insight for researchers analyzing the dual nature of these firms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Despite the importance of gender equality as a tool for national economic growth gaining prominent attention, women’s access to leadership and decision-making in cooperative societies remains under-researched. Design/methodology/approach: This study hinges on management and gender theories and systematic literature reviews. This study used a descriptive survey research design for primary data derived from a purposive non-random sampling technique that selected seven (7) active cooperative societies in Awka-South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Structured questionnaires were administered to the selected sample of 129 members. The hypotheses were analyzed using the T-test statistical model. Findings: This study revealed that social, legal, economic and cultural constraints affected women’s participation in cooperative societies in Awka, Anambra State. Also, that the African-based culture and family traditions, patriarchal societal system, household responsibilities and homemaker roles, religious associations, certain strict cooperative entry requirements, limitation on women’s access to resources and low paid wages and non-participatory training activities constrained the women. Therefore, the authors recommended that cooperatives should institute measures to encourage an increase in women members’ participation at the committee level and build their capacity own economic resources. Originality/value: This paper focuses on barriers that inhibit women’s participation in cooperative societies with a particular focus on their opportunities and outcomes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Cooperative-based growth model for agricultural enterprises is gradually gaining popularity in application. This study examined the effect of cooperative financial intervention on the growth of catfish aquaculture value chain in Nigeria. Primary data collected, with well-structured questionnaire from 120 participants in aquaculture value chain, were analyzed with descriptive statistical tools, cost and return function and 4-point likert-type scale. The result shows that 32.3% and 27.3% of processors and input suppliers accessed N320,000 and N270,000, respectively. Only 18.2% of producers accessed N180,000. The result indicates that there are more catfish producers than any other operators in the value chain. There is interdependence between catfish producers and input suppliers, processors and marketers in the value chain. Furthermore, catfish processors and inputs suppliers accessed more cooperative loan because their activities were capital intensive. The relatively high amount of cooperative fund accessed by these groups translated high growth rate of 55% and 53%, respectively. The major constraints to the growth of catfish value chain were inadequate credit access and high expenditure on inputs. Operators in the catfish aquaculture value chain should be encouraged to attend workshops on management techniques to improve the efficiency of their businesses. © 2019 Theophilus Miebi Gbigbi et al.},

	abstract = {Shifts in global agriculture have led more women into formal roles in the coffee industry as small-holder producers and cooperative members. Inclusion of women in these institutions, however, does not guarantee a change in historical power relations, or the benefits that might flow from this. A transformative change in gender relations not only requires changes in women' s attitudes and capacities and in the relationships between men and women, but also progress at the institutional and structural levels, a topic which has been infrequently studied. To address this gap, this paper explores institutional perspectives of stakeholders in the supply chain of a fair-trade organic coffee federation located in the western highlands of Guatemala. Major themes emerged from the interviews regarding women' s inclusion in the industry, gender sensitization, women' s empowerment, and supply chain support. The study finds that empowering women as productive cooperative members requires not only technical assistance and support, but also creation of an inclusive social and political environment that supports expanded choices for women and men. The paper expands our understanding of the historical context and current institutional dynamics that are fueling gender transformative change in the coffee industry. The conclusions find that this type of approach may lead to more than just superficial gender integration, and has the potential to result in the genuine integration of women into previously male-dominated organizations and the eventual percolation of society-wide shifts in gender norms, moving towards a more equitable society. © 2020.

	abstract = {Agricultural cooperatives have been extremely successful at producing and bringing food to billions of consumers around the world. Arguably, such success is caused by their superb ability to constantly adapt to the changing needs of their members and consumers. They do this by slightly modifying (tinkering) or completely altering (reinventing) their organizational design. This issue has not been studied in the context of agricultural cooperatives in former Soviet countries. Given the rising importance of agricultural cooperatives in such countries, however, understanding how cooperative adapt to the evolving preferences of their members and customers becomes of utter importance for both cooperative practitioners and policy makers. The current paper addresses the abovementioned knowledge gap. In particular, it identifies the ownership and governance models adopted by Estonian agricultural cooperatives, and provide key insights into how these organizations adapt to the changing needs of their members, consumers, and their external environment. Estonian agricultural cooperatives exhibit little experimentation with non-traditional ownership and governance models. This is due to the lack of technical expertise in the country, the relatively small size of the country's agricultural cooperatives, and their predominantly defensive strategies. Similarly to other European countries, tinkering is of outmost importance for Estonian agricultural cooperatives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Economic bargaining models contend that women’s paid work reduces violence experienced due to increased bargaining power, while male backlash models argue that violence is likely to increase as the traditional male breadwinner role is threatened. The empirical linkages between women working for pay and experiencing men’s violence are also mixed. This study examines the association between women’s paid work participation and their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) and non-partner violence (NPV). It uses multivariate probit regressions to analyze survey data from 937 randomly selected women members of cooperative societies spanning the seven districts of Nepal. The paper hypothesizes that in a traditional setting like Nepal, working women are more likely to experience increased violence as they transgress traditional gender roles. Results suggest that employed women experience both IPV and NPV. Investments in longitudinal studies are needed to understand the point at which economic empowerment yields reversals in violence experienced. HIGHLIGHTS Women’s work statuses influence their experiences of different forms of men’s violence in Nepal. Women’s paid work participation is not necessarily protective against violence by increasing their bargaining power. Women’s employment may increase exposure to violence because of underlying gender hierarchies. Longitudinal research is needed to understand when economic empowerment may avert violence. © 2020 IAFFE.},

Using a multi-stage sampling procedure, 384 growers were selected at random to participate in the survey. A structured household survey was the main tool for data collection. Descriptive statistical methods and the double-hurdle model were employed in the analysis. Our study finds that the probability of a household being participating in the apple value chain increases with household head education level, experience, extension contacts, and membership in local cooperatives, while decreases with household size and incidence of disease and insect pests. Results further showed that mango plot size and membership in local cooperatives increase the probability of participation decisions in the mango value chain. Moreover, households’ intensity of participation in the apple value chain increases with education level and extension contacts, whereas age squared and distance to the nearest market decrease their intensity of participation in the mango value chain. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at improving rural infrastructure (roads and markets), price information systems, human capital, and promotion of farmers’ cooperatives, as well as access to disease and insect pest control mechanisms, could improve the participation of farmers in the fruits value chain. © 2020 The Author(s).

The Bonusz Agro producer group was established in 2015, and its legal form is cooperative. They use cooperative principles such as the democratic decision-making process 'one member-one vote' principle for both significant and insignificant decisions, unlike some other cooperatives. The management of the cooperative is considering investing in a new industrial site. This new site will be for cleaning/drying the produce, and storing it in a new storage facility, among other things. The company currently lacks sufficient financial resources to make this investment possible. One of the obstacles to obtaining the necessary finances is the lack of collateral the organization has control over. This case study examines the investment decision. The main focus is on how the organization can enlist the contribution of all members. The most delicate part of the decision-making dilemma is that all members would have to offer some of their own assets as collateral. These assets would be part of their agricultural land, which is necessary to obtain the required external financial resources from banks. © 2020 Mizik.},

In the special case of credit granting organizations, it is important to clearly define rejection/approval criteria. In this direction, classification rules are an appropriate tool, provided that the rule set has low cardinality and that the antecedent of the rules has few conditions. This paper analyzes different solutions based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques, which are able to construct a set of classification rules with the aforementioned characteristics using information from the borrower and the macroeconomic environment at the time of granting the loan. In addition, to facilitate the understanding of the model, fuzzy logic is incorporated into the construction of the antecedent. To reduce the search time, the particle swarm is initialized by a competitive neural network. Different variants of PSO are applied to three databases of financial institutions in Ecuador. The first institution specializes in massive credit placement. The second institution specializes in consumer credit and business credit lines. Finally, the third institution is a savings and credit cooperative. According to our results, the incorporation of fuzzy logic generates rule sets with greater precision. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Group formation and recognition mechanisms can strongly influence the decision to cooperate or attack in animal societies. Therefore, testing how individuals recognize group membership, and the decision to cooperate or attack during social interactions is critical to understanding the evolution of sociality. We explore decision-making in the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina, a highly territorial and also cooperative species. Here, we report a previously undescribed rescue behavior for weaver ants, and determine the role of distance and group membership in residents’ decisions to either rescue or attack conspecifics in distress. First, we tested if residents preferentially rescued nestmates and attacked non-nestmates. Our results show that rescue was more likely for nestmates; however, surprisingly, conspecifics from neighboring colonies were rescued in 43% of the distress trials. Furthermore, attacks became more frequent as distance between colonies increased showing a dear enemy effect, which may be explained by familiarity, odor recognition, and/or relatedness. Our work exploring the factors that influence the decision to rescue or attack provides novel evidence to understand the underlying selective pressures that shape decisions of cooperation or conflict in highly cooperative societies. © 2018, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).},

In this context, this paper investigates the exchange rate exposure faced by a unique data set of 66 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives from 2000 to 2015, and finds that around one-third of the sampled firms exhibited significant exposure during this period, even after controlling for crises. The paper also documents that the proportion of exposed firms doubles during periods in which the local central bank intervenes more in the currency regime, lending support to the moral hazard hypothesis: when the exchange rate is less flexible, local companies tend to adopt unhedged positions in response to implicit government guarantees. Finally, firms with more debt, better asset management, lower inventory levels, and higher product differentiation tend to be less exposed to currency swings [EconLit Citations: F31, G15, G23]. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The modernisation of agriculture has been, and continues to be, the cause of an increasing disconnection between farming, nature, and society. This has given rise to a series of social, economic, and ecological crises in the food chain. Some farmers are responding to this by adjusting their land-use and farming practices so as to make their farms more sustainable. But such changes need to be aligned with the specificities of the local bio-physical environment and the logic of the political economic environment. This article highlights how cooperative approaches allow public and private regulatory systems to support ecological transitions. Through a theoretical lens on place-based and restorative farming practices it analyses and interprets three complementary cooperative approaches as possible starting points for the transition towards a more sustainable agri-food system. The case studies show how farmers cooperatives can be either linked to the environment and to public policies (and thus extrinsic product quality), or to the market (and intrinsic product quality), or a combination of both. These links provide competitive advantages to farmers, and enable them to increase income from farming. We then discuss the effectiveness of these forms of self-governance, and how cooperative approaches, if well organised and implemented and appropriately embedded, can empower farmers to further change and adapt their farming practices so as to restore and improve their endogenous resource base. The analysis shows that while they are place-specific they are far from locally/regionally-bounded and that their success (or failure) critically depends on their alignment with national, supra-national and global actants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The effect of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) application on yield, oil and fatty acids content (especially oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid) in rapeseed was investigated in the field experiment. Also effect of weather conditions was evaluated. The polyfactorial trial was realized in experimental years 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 in terms of agricultural cooperative in Mojmírovce. The experiment was based on three variants of fertilization treatments by the block method in three replications. The size of each block was created by plots with size 600 m2. The first level of treatment 10 was non-fertilized control. The second level of treatment 2U was fertilized by nitrogen in dose 240 kg.ha-1. The third level of treatment 3P was fertilized by the same dose of nitrogen 240 kg.ha-1 and by phosphorus in dose 88 kg.ha-1. The highest average yield 3.9 t.ha-1 was achieved at treatment 3P, where phosphorus was applied. It means statistically significant yield increase by 30% compared to treatment 2U, where no phosphorus was not applied. There was statistically non-significant difference in oil content, in the range of treatments. The content of oleic acid fluctuated from 63.3% to 65.9% and the highest was reached at unfertilized control treatments in both experimental years. The linoleic acid content ranged from 20.3% to 21.2% and content of linolenic acid varied between 6.9% and 8.9%. Application of nitrogen and nitrogen + phosphorus high statistically significant decreased oleic acid content in both experimental years. Opposite effect was observed, where content of linoleic and linolenic acid was high statistically significant increased after nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus fertilization. Effect of unequal weather conditions and treatments of nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus nutrition can influence the percentage ratio of higher fatty acids composition. © 2020 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno.

However, to maintain both agricultural production and the social community, understanding the impact on non-farmers in the community as one of the aspects of LC is extremely important. In this study, we surveyed rural areas about eight years after the LC was implemented by posted questionnaire and analysed the difference between farmers' and non-farmers' perceptions of the multifaceted evaluation items on the policy effect. The evaluation points for the LC include the following: [1] Impact on farming and farmland preservation, [2] Impact on community activation, and [3] Impact on collaboration between farmers and non-farmers. Results can be summarized as follows: First, it was confirmed that there is a trend for non-farmers' attachment to the area to be reduced because of LC. Second, non-farmers evaluations that LC attracts young farmers were also low. However, this opinion was much more noticeable in non-farmers who had quit agriculture recently than in the generation that had left agriculture because of LC. In other words, LC is a useful policy for improving agricultural conditions and agricultural structure. However, in some cases, the connections between farmers and non-farmers is weakened. Thus, cooperative activities to actively prevent this weakening are important. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A pilot composting project was initiated as part of a 200 tons/day solid waste recycling plant with active involvement of several local stakeholders. The project aimed at introducing compost production and use in the village of Al Jalameh, Palestine. This paper describes the successes and lessons from the pilot project. Methods: Based on the data collected on the population, waste production and economic activities, the best production methodology and composting units were designed and piloted. The compost was produced from animal manure, farm waste and organic fraction of domestic solid waste. Approaches to increase profit and sustain the initiative was implemented. Results: The facility managed by Al Jalameh Agricultural Cooperative Society, recycles 60% organic fraction of domestic waste reducing the quantity of waste to the landfill. An estimated 1425 m3/year of compost are required for local agriculture while 800 tons/year is produced. With most of their compost coming from Israeli sources, the composting facility is at a competitive advantage. To increase the profit, around 28,125 kg of waste plastic sheets from greenhouses are collected for recycling each year generating a stable income of 5625.00 JOD/year. Conclusions: The compost produced in the village is purchased by the local farmers increasing access to compost at competitive price. Farmers are economically encouraged by compost production that could solve the organic waste management issue and at the same time guarantee a sort of “self-production” of fertiliser useful for local agriculture. This initiative could be extended to other villages in Jenin and other developing countries where agriculture is their major occupation. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Therefore, the challenge for Indonesia is to make the entrepreneurs reach substantial contributions. This study investigates on three variables; namely entrepreneurial orientation, cooperatives, and entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial orientation is the exogeneous variable, cooperative is the mediator variable and, the entrepreneur is the endogenous variable. These three variables are formed into three sub-models and one complete model. Each sub-model is to find out whether the dimensions contribute to each variable, and the entire model is to find out a significant relationship among the variables. The method used is the structural equation model (SEM), with computer software LISREL. This research will produce a breakthrough in how cooperative can mediate from entrepreneurial orientation to entrepreneurs. Besides, the study will deliver how cooperative stakeholders to get some understanding of entrepreneurial orientation so that cooperatives as an institution can persuade members of organizations to become entrepreneurs to be ready to contribute to economic growth. Moreover, the results provide the science of sustainable management on how to apply creativity and innovation to the cooperative organization. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the Nordic countries, agricultural co-operatives were important when family farmers organised to get access to the quickly developing markets during industrialisation in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These co-operatives were organised both as credit, insurance, processing and marketing co-operatives. Spreading at first from Denmark to the rest of Northern Europe and later reaching the new settler continent in North America, farmers’ co-operatives soon became a key element in private farming in market economies. As many co-operatives became large companies in the capitalist economies, they either became ordinary share companies, or retained their farmer-owned co-operative status like in Norway. After Marxist-inspired revolutions in Russia, China, Eastern Europe and later Vietnam and Cuba, state organised and government-controlled co-operatives were set up in socialist countries. Many of the old forms of agricultural co-operatives in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe collapsed when the centrally planned economies were abolished in the early 1990s. However, new forms of food production and distribution cooperation have emerged both in the capitalist and former socialist countries. These co-operatives were organised both among producers and consumers in order to meet the common needs of direct access to foods. While it is assumed that family farming and food markets will have to play a more important role in the Cuban food economy in the future, it will be interesting to see if small farmers in collaboration with wholesale co-operatives will be allowed to develop short and sustainable supply food chains, which could be competitive against state socialist and multinational capitalist agriculture. Cuban agricultural policy must be able to evolve along two strategies: a volume agriculture that delivers high-quality, durable basic foods to the predominantly urban population, but also delivers local traditional food with craftsmanship to tourists and a growing middle class. Both strategies will be necessary in order to address a historic challenge of the Cuban socio-economic development: to produce sufficient food and make it available to consumers at affordable prices, thus also saving scarce currency today spent on food imports. © 2020.

In cooperatives, which are member- and user-driven rather than profit-driven, this approach is essential. The aim of this study is to analyze director selection in agricultural cooperatives by using a qualitative approach and hence, contribute to theory development. The results indicate that the director selection process and roles contain several paradox issues in two dimensions: administrative culture as well as the roles and authority of important actors. The paper contributes to the understanding of (1) mechanisms and relationships inherent in the process of director selection in agricultural cooperatives (2) the administrative culture as well as the roles and authority of the actors in the process and (3) paradoxes which help us to understand tensions in director selection under the requirement of fulfilling both the performance task and the conformance task. The paper discusses the results against the current board theories and suggests a new paradox dimension. It is suggested that director selection should be studied further from the perspectives of (1) implications of the use of authority and (2) the implications of the administrative culture. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Adaptation and mitigation strategies constitute the front line of attack for rural households in developing countries that rely on agricultural production and natural resource use as their main source of income and growth, and whose livelihoods are threatened by climate change. This study models the determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices by coffee producers in the department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua. Using primary survey data, we analyze the extent to which cooperative membership impacts adoption of ten different practices. We find that coffee farmers who belong to cooperatives have adopted sustainable practices at higher rates than non-members, and that the odds of adoption are higher for members than for non-members. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structural differences between the ten practices, and from this analysis three factors emerged and were modeled. We find that cooperative membership is a significant determinant of practices that promote water conservation, yet not significant for practices that promote soil and plant health, nor for practices related to field management. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors, and development and extension practitioners in the coffee sector, as they can better inform and guide policies toward more efficient and effective paths of long-term climate change adaptation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse performance (on efficiency) of agricultural cooperatives in Mpumalanga province, South Africa, using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The empirical investigation is motivated by the dearth of empirical literature on agricultural cooperatives’ performance measurement and its correlates. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed DEA and applied the input minimisation constraint. The authors used the data from 19 agricultural cooperatives which had complied with reporting on their annual financial statements (AFS) in the financial year 2014/2015. The input variables were total assets and total expenses, and the output variables were revenue and profit. Findings: The average technical efficiency was found to be 72 per cent efficient indicating the presence of 28 per cent resource wastages. Of the 19 decision-making units, only 5 (26 per cent) were 100 per cent efficient. It should be noted that the 26 per cent that were technically efficient were also operating at constant returns to scale (optimal resource allocation). Research limitations/implications: Data limitation was with regard to 19 cooperatives, which means that if more agricultural cooperatives could be analysed, the results will be different. Practical implications: There are more than 60 agricultural cooperatives in the province, and yet only 19 could report on their AFS. This is an indication that there is a gap in governance, and policy makers and government need to revisit support, over and above funding, and issues of governance have to be strengthened. Social implications: Agricultural cooperatives are created as vehicles that can stimulate the economy and contribute towards job creation. If the cooperatives do not perform or are not sustainable, the socio-economic conditions of the communities in which they operate will never realise the economic gains. Originality/value: The study was necessitated by the continued focus on government based on the cooperatives, as there is a dearth of empirical literature separating managers’ reports and empirically proven studies/results. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The article explores the histories of oil palm in Nicaragua during the 20th century within a drastically changing Political Economy. In Nicaragua, palm oil cultivation dates back to the 1950s, when the United Fruit Company started to plant oil palm on the Atlantic Coast. In the 1980s, due to the agrarian reform of the Sandinista revolution, political conditions and economic strategies changed completely. In this era, a socialist government started to create agricultural cooperatives for oil palm. After the defeat of the revolution, during the neoliberal era of the 1990s, palm oil cultivation expanded in different surges. This expansion was tied to funding from international organizations, especially during the conjuncture of the bioenergy framework, which implied a new narrative of sustainability from the global level. The extent of the territory on which oil palm is cultivated more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2010, and again more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, although the Sandinista government was back in power and not particularly supportive of oil palm. The article argues that although the drivers, the main actors, their specific arguments, funding sources, and policies promoting oil palm have varied over time, the narrative of 'already degraded land' has consistently been used. Social contestations from below point not only to environmental and social consequences, but to the funding schemes and narratives of international institutions sponsoring and promoting oil palm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Because farmer satisfaction is particularly important for the success and development of cooperatives, this article focuses on an analysis of the factors related to farmer satisfaction as well as the identification of demographic and socio-economic elements that can explain the different levels of satisfaction among different cooperative members. Data obtained through a survey of 150 cocoa farmers were analyzed through three main statistical methods: (1) an exploratory factor analysis with a principal component analysis method; (2) cluster analysis; and (3) an independent samples t-test. The results confirm that farmer satisfaction is explained by a complex set of cognitive and psycho-social elements and pro-social emotions.

Second, with the goal of helping cooperatives to develop solutions, it verifies the types of difficulties encountered in the current configuration of markets that cooperatives are placed in. Third, it identifies actions to minimize the managerial problems of agricultural cooperatives. This work is based on a multicase study on 10 agricultural cooperatives in the state, whose managers were interviewed in a semi-structured way in 2016. The results showed that the main problems encountered in the management of these organizations are as follows. a) Cooperatives compete with other companies in the sector, and they must be competitive while being faithful to the cooperative principles. b) The team responsible for the cooperatives’ management finds it difficult to compete in oligopolized markets. c) Cooperative members’ participation in management is low. d) Cooperatives’ associates and members exhibit opportunistic behaviors. Three categories of current problems were verified in the management of agricultural cooperatives: 1) political and institutional, 2) behavioral, and 3) technical-administrative. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This study analyzes the impact of commercial vegetable cooperative membership on smallholder agricultural performance in Cambodia. Institutional heterogeneities are considered across cooperatives and various econometric techniques are used to control for potential selection bias. The impacts of horticulture on agricultural outcomes are also analyzed. The results indicate that membership of commercial vegetable cooperatives has so far had no effect on agricultural incomes or the value or amounts of agricultural inputs. However, results indicate that membership has affected technology choice, access to credit services and information transmission through technological training. Additionally, there is evidence that horticulture, as a component of overall agricultural diversification, can augment farm income. The results suggest that much of the benefit of cooperative membership stems from the cooperative's provision of services, which might not be easily inferred from measures of member incomes. © 2019 The Authors.

This article looks into the need for sustainable innovativeness assessment in agricultural business. To the best of our knowledge, farm sustainable innovativeness measurement has not been investigated in detail and no objective methodology for innovativeness assessment has yet been proposed. The objective of this article is to look into the possibility of using some methodology for measuring farm sustainable innovativeness and thus ranking farms based on this criterion. The article demonstrates the need for a multi-criteria method of innovativeness measurement and substantiates the complex proportional assessment method (COPRAS) as the most appropriate choice for addressing this challenge. The article presents the model of use of the proposed method and describes its practical application. The final result refutes the opinion that farm innovation depends only on possibilities of investing in a certain area. Indeed, staff creativity and the position of the management regarding certain areas of business make an essential contribution to the sustainable innovativeness level in the agricultural organisations. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research was to investigate the levels of adoption and management accounting practices in the farming cooperatives of the Paraná State. The Brazilian agribusiness sector presented an accumulated growth rate of 4.28% in the period from January to October 2016, evidencing its importance in resumption of the Brazilian economic growth. The research population is composed by 64 farming cooperatives from Paraná. The research is aligned to the Abdel-Kader and Luther (2008) and Guerreiro et al. (2011) studies, whose questionnaires were adapted for this study. To the potential respondents were sent a link and returned 38 valid questionnaires. The data collected were treated using descriptive statistics - means, variance and standard deviation. In the surveyed sample 58.6% of the farming cooperatives employ up to 100 employees. The remaining respondents, 13.5% up to 500, 5.4% up to 1000 and 21.6% up to 3000 employees. The findings of this study are in line with those of some previous studies regarding the adoption and use of more traditional accounting practices. The majority of the farming cooperatives studied in Paraná use to a higher degree the managerial accounting practices listed in the evolutionary stages 1 and 2 of IFAC (1998), but also using some practices of stages 3 and 4. In relation to the most contemporary tools such as target costing, Economic Value Added (EVA) and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) findings suggest low level of adoption and utilization. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that there is still a paradox between the set of tools available in the literature and those practiced by the organizations. © 2019, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the performance of the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires with 1–5 Likert scale. The sample consisted of the representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in Central Java Province, representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in West Java Province and some farmers who are members of those dairy cooperatives. This study uses balanced supply chain management scorecard for measuring the performance of dairy supply chain, importance-performance analysis (IPA) for identifying the indicators that are most in need of improvement, and strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) analysis for formulating strategic planning. Findings: The results of balanced supply chain management scorecard combined with IPA analysis showed that the performance relationship between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in West Java Province is slightly better than that in Central Java Province. It can be seen from the average value of the score of indicator, the category of each indicator and the category of the performance index of each relationship. The major weakness of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province lies in the different perspective (no perspective is dominant), whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer. On the other hand, the major strength of the relationship in Central Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer, whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of learning and growth. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of the dairy cooperatives as the sample and the type of scale used to measure the performance of the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and individual milk processors. So, the future research may replicate this study by surveying all the dairy cooperatives in Central Java and West Java Provinces. It may also enhance the measurement of the performance of the relationships by using a direct measure of each indicator in each perspective, rather than recording the management of dairy cooperative perceptions. Practical implications: This research provides essential insights for the management of dairy cooperative in the context of strategic planning development. The research reveals that there is a different strategic planning for improving the performance of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in each province. It depends on the major weakness and strength of the relationships, and also, opportunity and threat faced by the dairy industry. One important thing, the management of dairy cooperative in both provinces should have strategic planning related to the use of machine milking by farmers to improve the milk quality. Social implications: The research revealed that strategic planning could be built after analyzing the internal and external conditions carefully. It may encourage more dairy cooperatives to measure and analyze the internal and external conditions at the bottom of strategic planning of their business. Originality/value: Although this research only used the balanced supply chain management scorecard and IPA analysis for measuring the performance, and SWOT analysis in formulating the strategic planning for improving the current performance, it will make a difference. First, instead of measuring the performance of dairy cooperatives, this research measured the performance of the relationships between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors. This way, the dairy cooperatives were only sources of data collection. Second, the investigation was quite complicated since the objects of the research were represented by the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results suggest that, on average, banks are the most efficient MFIs; while NGOs are, on average, the least efficient MFIs. On average, all 4 groups are more pure technically efficient than scale efficient. Banks, nongovernmental organizations, nonbanking financial institutions, cooperatives and credit unions all seem to have problems with scale efficiency.

	abstract = {This paper is a summary of the findings of research work conducted in two case studies in the Rift Valley, Kenya. This study used the Neo-Institutional theory to interrogate how the rules and regulations (institutions involved) of the agrarian reform process in Kenya are constantly changing and helping to shape the livelihoods of social actors around Mau Forest. The first case study-Ndungulu, is a settlement scheme where the Ogiek ethnic community were resettled between 1995 and 1997 after the land clashes of 1992. The second case study is the Kamuyu cooperative farm, a post-colonial settlement scheme owned by a cooperative society that was founded in 1965 by members from the Kikuyu ethnic group. This study employed qualitative data collection methods intermittently between 2012 and 2017 for a total of two years. A total of 60 interviews were conducted for this research. Thirteen (13) of these were key informant interviews with experts on land. The qualitative interviews were complemented by participant observations and nine focus group discussions. The qualitative data from the interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed, coded and analyzed thematically. Observations documented as field notes were also analyzed to complement the study findings. In this paper, the challenges, bargaining position and power play between social actors and government institutions implicated in the agrarian reform process in Kenya has been brought to the forefront. For instance, due to the structural issues that date back to the colonial period, the Ogiek have found innovative ways to maintain their daily existence (e.g., maintaining traditional methods of apiculture in Mau Forest). However, constraints in accessing forest land has resulted in them taking desperate measures, namely; selling off land to the Kalenjin in what is called "distress land sales". On the contrary, the neighboring Kikuyu have maintained their land ownership status despite recurrent ethnic clashes that have occurred during general election years. © 2018 by the authors.},

However, they also face number of challenges which may affect their performance. Most of the previous studies in the area of SACCOS did not concentrate on their performance. The aim of this study therefore was to assess performance of SACCOS in Maseru District, Lesotho. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design where data were collected at one point in time. A sample size of 369 respondents was computed by the use of formula by Yamane (1967). Respondents in the sample were selected by using simple random sampling technique. However, respondents from individual SACCOS were proportional to the total number of members in particular SACCOS. This was done in order to make the sample representative of all SACCOS in the study area. Analyses of data were done by using different techniques which include: mathematical equations (i to vii); different financial ratios; tables; graphs; bar charts and other types of descriptive statistics like mode and percentages. It was found that socio economic characteristics of members were supportive to financial performance of the SACCOS. Furthermore, SACCOS in the study area achieved high performance in terms of ratios of members' capital; loan delinquency; volumes of savings in the SACCOS; and growth of total assets. On the other hand, the SACCOS realised poor financial performance in terms of ratio of fixed assets to total assets; and share capital owned by members. © 2019, International Journal of Financial Research.},

These entities played a key role in the institutional architecture of the apartheid regime, ensuring the domination of white commercial farmers over the sector. Within the framework of the deregulation of the economy and the agricultural sector, such entities faced transformations of modern capitalism, especially the growing power of financial actors and markets. Although white commercial farmers still largely retain these inherited structures, these companies are presently being targeted more and more by private takeovers and/or private equity deals. Based on two specific empirical examples of private equity deals affecting South African grain cooperatives, this paper describes this financialization process in practice, in particular by analysing the interaction between financial and agricultural actors and the alliances on the ground that determine its “success.” In doing so, it details the different trajectories of these (former) cooperatives, highlighting the resilience, mutation, and extinction of commercial agriculture in South Africa. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Being the lowest echelon of a co-operative's internal governance hierarchy, district councils constitute a link between the membership and the board of directors. Previous research indicates that district council members are often driven by a co-operative conviction and social concerns. The present study challenges this view. On the basis of a survey of all 191 district council members and council chairpersons of a large Swedish agricultural co-operative, it is found that the elected representatives rank low in terms of co-operative conviction and social concerns. They involve themselves mainly in order to get personal benefits; they want to gain access to information, mature personally and obtain inputs to develop their farm enterprises.

	abstract = {Agricultural cooperatives evolve in a context with complexity and changes of their legal, social and business environment. Strategic management could be a relevant approach to help cooperative members to improve the global performance and the social responsibility of their cooperatives. To formalize and to manage their strategy, we propose as an accompaniment a method entitled PerfCuma. The theoretical framework is based on the concept of systemic approach to change. The method is organized in four steps: i) an in-depth stakeholder's analysis of the cooperative situation (including sustainability) and the cooperative goals; ii) formalizing the strategy by defining strategic lines. We use the cognitive map approach to model the complexity to understand the strong drivers of the strategy; iii) drawing up the balanced scorecard and an action plan to manage the strategy; iv) monitoring the implementation of the strategy. A test of the method on five Cooperatives for the Use of Agricultural Equipment (Cuma) has been successful. The method is now unfolded in France. © 2018 International Farm Management Association and Institute of Agricultural Management.},

This is an exploratory and descriptive research, which under the approach of the approach is classified as qualitative. Documentary research was carried out analyzing the financial statements, as well as a bibliographical research for the theoretical basis of the study. Of the 30 largest companies listed by Exame magazine, 17 are cooperatives, and this work analyzed 12 cooperatives, or 70.58% of the population in this segment. The financial statements were obtained through the companies' websites, and the contents of the explanatory notes of the cooperatives under study were analyzed. It was evident in the research that there is a problem that is repeated in other researches carried out on the subject, which is the measurement of assets at fair value. It was also noted that the explanatory notes of the cooperatives analyzed do not generally provide detailed information on their biological assets, and therefore are insufficient for understanding the situation of these assets, which in some way compromises the decision-making of users interested in this information. © 2019, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

To validate the model a set of gasification experiments were performed in a 250 kW quasi-industrial gasifier. The cold gas efficiency of the th gasifier and tar production were evaluated to assess the energy potential of olive pomace while determining its most suitable end-use applications. A techno-economic analysis addressing the comparison of two different commercially manufactured gasifying unit sizes (100 kW and 1000 kW) and a Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis were employed to assess both the feasibility of each application size and also foresee the main investment risks in conducting olive pomace gasification in small rural facilities. Olive pomace gasification showed to be more suitable for personal household purposes. The low cold gas efficiency (around 20%) makes this producer gas more appropriate for small cogeneration facilities applications. The use of olive pomace residues in gasification showed viable economic performance in small cogeneration solutions at a scale of 1000 kW for agriculture waste-to-energy recovery in olive oil agriculture cooperatives, while 100 kW showed to be unable to reach an economically sustainable scenario. Final remarks point out that despite the feasibility of the venture at a scale of 1000 kW special concerns must be considered regarding the study attractiveness to potential investors. © 2019 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.},

	abstract = {Promoting sustainable agricultural practices such as agroforestry (AF) could improve long-term productivity, enhance a sustainable rural livelihood and reduce pressure on natural resources and ecosystems in the tropics. However, AF seems to have adoption problems due to external market forces, lack of skills, financial resources and know-how ending in low flexibility and discontinuity of farmers in practicing AF. The objective of this study is to identify social, institutional, and economic factors that influence the adoption of AF on the household and community level, taking the region Alta Verapaz in Guatemala as a case study. Alta Verapaz is amongst the poorest regions in the country but also a tropical biodiversity hotspot where current agricultural practices are threatening forest environments and social development objectives. Our study explores how capital accessibility and institutional incentives are related to farmer’s livelihood sustainability and AF compositions. The methodology is composed by semi-structured interviews with nineteen farmers and field observations. The interviews have been analysed based on a qualitative content analysis by using the inductive category development. Based on these outcomes, the study found that human and economical capitals are favoured in communities were institutions are present especially through AF training offers, creation of farmers cooperatives and economic incentives. The role of institutions resulted to be crucial in the promotion of organic AF methods, forest protection and creation of long-term income. The combination of agricultural diversification with institutional incentives is one key livelihood strategy adopted by the farmers in order to achieve a socio-economic and ecological sustainability of their households. The further promotion of community forestry projects, expansion of networks and ongoing agricultural trainings as well as the diversification of agricultural systems could be beneficial for farmers in Alta Verapaz. © Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Community development is seen as a crucial factor to realize sustainable development and vice versa, and for indigenous peoples in particular due to their associations with nature and natural resources. However, historical exploitation of indigenous peoples has resulted in their underachievement worldwide. The popularization of the concept of sustainable development followed a series of international treaties and conventions that shed light on indigenous peoples' revival. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's notion of the power-knowledge relationship, this article uses a case study of an indigenous tribe, the Smangus in Taiwan, to demonstrate how a politically, socially and economically disadvantaged community incorporates their traditional norms and customs into the notion of sustainable development and reinterprets it to adapt the community's conditions. By re-uniting the community and establishing a cooperative organization, the community has revived cohesion in their community. The community's conduct is investigated through the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030, and the article illustrates how it fulfils three Targets and the extent to which they are fulfilled. To conclude, Smangus' case remind us of the importance of achieving sustainable development goals on micro- and local levels, and the value of empowering local communities to pursue their own sustainable development goals according to their circumstances. This article ends with suggestions for future research, and suggests that more studies using such a bottom-up approach to sustainable development would help to accumulate knowledge and experiences to establish a pattern of success to help other disadvantaged communities, draw focus to the need to bridge the policy gaps between the United Nations and local communities, and recall attention to the role of micro- and local communities to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2018 by the authors.},

The primary contribution of this paper is the analysis of whether FT impacts the dynamics of the different SC dimensions. This study used both quantitative and qualitative techniques. I surveyed 97 farmers from Atok (fair trade supplier) and 96 farmers from Tublay (non-fair trade supplier). Also, I conducted focus group discussions of 8 to 10 members from each group and in-depth interviews with formal and informal leaders and key-informants (buyer and local government leaders). The t-test revealed that the farmer cooperative that supplies to FT organization has a significantly higher tendency to ask support from non-government organizations (NGO) and financial institutions. Likewise, they have a higher score in collective action and perceived economic performance. Additionally, regression analysis showed that trust in local government unit (LGU), empowerment, and cooperative classification are positive predictors of perceived economic performance while trust in NGO and membership expansion have negative effects on perceived economic performance. © 2018 by De La Salle University.},

A six-dimensional model comprising 20 sub-criteria is constructed and both the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique and DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) are used to explore interrelationships among the indices and their related weights. Finally, the modified VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method is employed to evaluate performance gaps in the four major types of commercial banks in China-state-owned, joint-stock, city commercial banks, and other credit cooperatives-in the field of service innovation. The improvement priorities, ranked from highest to lowest, are new business partners, new service concepts, organizational innovation, technological innovation, new customer interactions, and new revenue models. These results will provide strategies for the sustainable development of China's banking industry and the implementation of changes in response to the impact of the Fintech revolution. © 2019 by the authors.},

The results revealed that characteristics of rubber cooperatives were divided into primary and secondary businesses. Four rubber cooperatives obtained the highest revenue from gathering rubber products as primary business, accounting for 50 percent of all rubber cooperatives, covering 22.53 million (THB.) per year. Regarding secondary business, two rubber cooperatives generated the highest revenue by supplying and selling fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, and processing rubber products accounting for 4 million (THB) per year. Seven cooperatives (87.5%) had acceptable financial performance ratios. This finding implied that these cooperatives were successful in terms of operation. The ability of rubber cooperatives to meet current obligations and the use of resources were effective. In contrast, only one cooperative investing in rubber processing gained an unacceptable financial performance ratio which was below than 2. The Acid-test (-0.17) demonstrated rubber cooperative dependency upon inventory. Additionally, the inventory turnover ratio was excessively high. There was much invested in rubber processing, machinery, and equipment. Cooperative management should consider financial ratios as an important tool to investigate the performance of rubber cooperatives. © 2018 International Journal of Agricultural Technology.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Community-based initiatives with a double objective of improving rural livelihoods and conserving forest resources face the challenge of balancing the two objectives without creating trade-offs. Our study investigates the socio-economic performance of a community-based initiative that uses cooperative-driven organic certification of honey producers in Mwingi, Eastern Kenya, to improve livelihoods and acacia woodland management. Data were collected through a household survey of 303 beekeepers from 38 organic certified and 16 non-certified beekeeper groups. More data were collected using key informant interviews, informal conversations, participant observation, participatory rural appraisal, internal document reviews and secondary sources. The survey included questions regarding beekeepers' livelihood activities, organisation involvement, quantity of honey produced and sold, net honey income and welfare perceptions after certification (2015) and before certification (2008), retrospectively. The results showed minimal to no significant impacts of certification on households' incomes, honey quantity or sales prices, as the general development, though positive, followed that of the non-certified households. The lack of impacts stemmed from failure to monitor and technical backstopping of certified beekeepers, a poor cooperative management and mistrust among the members and Mwingi organic cooperative board. The board mainly bought honey from a non-certified middleman thereby undermining the Mwingi organic cooperative's values as well as their own potential niche market. On a positive note, the cooperative's honey market place, receiving customers from afar, has the potential to support the development of a niche organic market outlet. However, this requires reconnection of the cooperative to its members, trust rebuilding and transparent management of the cooperative. The study exemplifies a case of community-based livelihoods-conservation initiative which did not take local community capacity development and more general long-term project sustainability into consideration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

For this purpose, a survey of cooperative members and financial information was obtained from the Superintendency of Popular and Solidarity Economy. For data analysis, the nonparametric binary logistic regression technique was used to evaluate the impact of cooperative principles as determinants of the financial performance of said entities in the period under study. It is evident that with the greater economic participation of partners the profitability will improve. On the other hand, the activities of self-management and independence can generate high costs assumed by the cooperatives, diminishing patrimonial sufficiency. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

	abstract = {Globalization of agricultural markets put pressures on producer cooperatives to invest in expansion and growth to safeguard their competitiveness. Availability of capital is limited if farmers do not have incentives to increase their capital contribution. Cooperative literature recognizes the residual rights, transferability, and the appreciation potential of the investment as the potential solutions for the problems that may impede cooperative investments. The objective of this study is to understand farmer preferences regarding investment attributes and the potential for attracting investment capital from members and non-members. We employ a choice experiment method to test new cooperative investment instruments. The data consist of a questionnaire conducted with 406 Finnish dairy farmers. Random parameter latent class logit model is used in the estimation of the data. The results indicate that most of the respondents regard the new investment instruments positively. However, farmers prefer restricting ownership rights to members. Incentives for members to participate in financing cooperative growth could be designed with capital-based residual rights, mechanisms for transferability and for the appreciation of firm value. Estimation that considered choice difficulty improved model fit, which highlights the need to address respondent burden also in future studies of hypothetical investments in order to produce unbiased estimates. © 2018 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2018 CIRIEC},

To this end, a case study was carried out with the representatives of the supply chain members in CMR, which included coffee producers, cooperatives and a development foundation. It was verified the predominance of practices focused on environmental issues, followed by social and, finally, economic ones. It is also highlighted that the data identified allow us to understand that the development of sustainable strategies can bring positive effects to the agents studied.

This means that they generally operate in accordance with the principles endorsed by the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA). However, only a few of these organizations are successful in commercializing the agricultural produce of their members. In this study, we argue that growth-problems leading to commercial failure and organizational degeneration in these cooperatives can be attributed to a lack of managerial capital. Drawing on the literature and evidence from the field we set out key management solutions for counterbalancing cooperative principles in the context of rural Africa. These solutions were taught to the leaders and managers of 362 cooperatives at four training events held in Madagascar, Malawi and twice in Uganda. Using a production function for cognitive achievement and key informant interviews, we find that our training contributed to the adoption of the proposed solutions by some of the cooperatives. Using the Ugandan sub- sample, we estimate an OLS regression and a PSM model to show that the training translated into higher revenues per member generated through collective commercialization. © 2018 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2018 CIRIEC},

In contrast, media accounts of co-operatives are relatively scarce, particularly, in the United Kingdom, where business reporting usually focuses on capitalist narratives, with alternatives routinely marginalised until a scandal pushes them into the public eye. This article analyses media coverage of the United Kingdom’s Co-operative Bank (2011–2015), tracing its transformation from an unremarkable presence on the UK high street to preferred bidder for Lloyds Bank branches and its subsequent near collapse. The article charts changes in reporting and media interest in the bank through five discursive frames: member and customer service; standard financial reporting; human interest, personality-driven journalism; the public relations machine; and political coverage. Our analysis discusses three points: the politicisation of the story through covert and overt political values; simplification and sensationalism; and media hegemony. We argue that although moments of crisis provide an opening for re-evaluating the dominant reporting model, established frames tend to reassert themselves as a story develops. This produces good copy that reflects the interests of the publishers but does not extend understanding of co-operative organisations. Thus, the article identifies the role of the media in delegitimising organisations with alternative governance structures, thereby promoting ideological and economic conformity. © The Author(s) 2018.},

We discuss 56 peer-reviewed publications to illustrate the main findings and conclusions while outlining challenges and opportunities for future research. Generally, cooperative membership is found to positively impact price, yield, input adoption, income, and other indicators of member performance, yet there is growing evidence of an uneven distribution of benefits for small and large producers. In terms of structure, evidence of a causal relationship of ownership and governance to performance has been elusive, yet there are now many findings of inherent equity and long-term debt constraints, often in the context of consolidation to drive scale and scope economies. Further inefficiency is observed to be driven by increased heterogeneity in member attitudes and objectives, in particular in terms of commitment and participation. Thus, overall, empirical work portrays farmer cooperatives as flawed and complex business organizations which nonetheless have a strong positive impact on its members. While applied research may progress in various directions, a general improvement in empirical methodologies is needed to allow robust analysis of mixed objectives in dynamic environments. © 2018 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2018 CIRIEC},

Horizontal communication (HC) is characterized as the exchange of information between farmers in the society of members. It is associated with process innovation. Vertical communication (VC) is the exchange of information between a member and the CEO of the cooperative enterprise. It is associated with product innovation. The CEO decides regarding the deliveries of the member and the level of vertical communication in the centralized cooperative, while these decisions are taken by the members in the decentralized cooperative.

Design/methodology/approach: This research used the geometric mean of the real rate of return on equity to identify financially stressed agricultural cooperatives. The real rate of return on equity allows the allocation of total financial stress among the return on assets, leverage and interest rate issues. Findings: This study found that financially non-stressed agricultural cooperatives had a higher rate of return on equity and rate of return on assets, but lower leverage ratios and interest rates than stressed agricultural cooperatives. Further, non-stressed cooperatives had higher total assets and sales compared to stressed cooperatives. This suggests that smaller cooperatives are more likely to face financial stress than larger cooperatives. The decomposition of the financial problem showed that a substantial percentage of financial stress was correlated with a low return on assets or profitability. A smaller percentage of financial stress was due to financing decisions. Originality/value: This study provides value by measuring the impact of profitability, leverage and interest rate on the financial performance of agricultural cooperatives. Results showed that a substantial proportion of financial stress was associated with a low return on assets. This indicates that profitability is a problem for agricultural cooperatives. This study also examines profitability during a period of volatile returns in production agriculture. © 2019, In accordance with section 105 of the US Copyright Act, this work has been produced by a US government employee and shall be considered a public domain work, as copyright protection is not available.},

	abstract = {The paper studies the current situation in the agricultural sector of Georgia, its impact on the country’s economy and possibilities of development. Agriculture is a traditional sector and it has always played an important role in economic and social development of Georgia. The country has favorable conditions for the development of agricultural sector. Despite urbanization processes in recent years, about half of Georgian population still lives in rural areas and most of them are employed or self-employed in this sector. Therefore, the level of development of agriculture in the country impacts the lives of significant share of the country’s population. Agriculture has been paid more attention by the government of Georgia in recent years. In particular, various programs and projects have been initiated and implemented in this direction. These programs aim at encouraging the development of various agricultural activities as well as development of processing industry, which will lead to increasing production and export of Georgian agricultural products. However, currently, development of agricultural sector in Georgia significantly lags behind other sectors of the economy mainly due to insufficient financing of this sector, lack of access to relevant technologies and lack of development of processing industry for raw agricultural materials. Therefore, a number of measures, like scientific-research activities, increasing the awareness of farmers, introduction of technological novelties and improvement of agro-insurance system that will enhance the competitiveness of the sector still need to be implemented. © 2019 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

Scholars have mainly focused on the organizational integration of three sub-systems: production/operations, marketing/sales, and R&D. This study explored the organizational integration of the organizational unit in charge of the firm's IT and information systems: the IT function. This construct has five key dimensions: integration of the IT function with top management, business units, customers, non-IT suppliers, and IT providers. Analysis of data from 236 responses to a survey questionnaire confirmed that all five dimensions positively influence the firm's market performance. The contribution of the firm's information systems to both competitive and cooperative organizational capabilities strongly mediates this relationship. This research model highlights the complementary explanatory power of Lawrence and Lorsch's (1967) theory of organizational integration, the business-IT alignment literature, and the resource-based view (RBV). The results suggest that the more firms evolve towards IT-enabled business environments, the more they need IT managers to be socially embedded in these environments and to contribute actively to the overall knowledge-based organizational integration of the system. © 2017 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge},

Cooperatives offer a well-established livelihood strategy and means to support small-holders. This case study examined a Ukrainian cooperative using the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) to understand the role cooperatives play in addressing climate change, and the process by which capacity is used to adapt and/or mitigate climate change. Climate change does not prompt cooperative formation and climate change mitigation might not be a planned outcome in a livelihood strategy. However, modifying the SLF to include climate change outcomes provides a means of understanding the process by which building capacity results in mitigation and adaptation. Cooperative members and stakeholders outside of the cooperative participated in semi-structure interviews. Social capital emerged as a theme with interviewees from all backgrounds. Initially closed networks and distrust prevented members from joining the cooperative. As the cooperative built new networks, the benefit of joining became apparent to members. Information gained through networks improved access to other capitals, improved livelihood outcomes and addressed climate change. Social capital fulfils key roles in the process of capacity building and implementation of sustainable measures; thus improving social capital could arguably be the chief benefit of cooperatives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Since the 1990s, producers of farm commodities have been attempting to enter value-added agri-food sectors by means of joint ownership of hybrid cooperatives. New generation cooperatives, characterized by substantial supply and equity requirements, inspired much farm producer optimism before revealing weaknesses and limitations in the early 2000s. In response, recent innovations in US cooperative state law introduced the limited cooperative association (LCA), a new legal entity allowing joint ownership by member patrons and member investors to facilitate large-scale equity acquisition. However, business registration data indicate few such organizations have been formed in the agri-food industry. The LCA is adopted by several small-scale operations in niche markets such as lamb, elderberry, and non-GMO seed, but there is not much interest among business organizations in the commodity sector. This paper raises possible explanations for the limited adoption of the LCA, including the competing objectives of farmers and investors, the ambiguous legal interpretation of investor objectives, the superiority of other legal structures, and the lack of strategic advantages. The conclusion facilitates an invitation to further study the challenging future of farmer cooperatives in the agri-food industry. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Because of inherent constraints, few farmer cooperatives use branding to pursue differentiation and competitiveness in the agri-food industry. Considering the complete lack of applied research on the brand–performance relationship for farmer cooperatives, it is unknown if branding is even profitable. This paper addresses the gap in our understanding with a novel panel study of 707 US marketing cooperatives for the 2005–2011 period. Informed by lagged observations of trademark and service mark data, the empirical analysis indicates a positive relationship of brand equity to the financial performance of marketing cooperatives. Specifically, 1% increases in the total stock of trademarks and service marks have a positive impact of $130,441 and $141,921, respectively, on the net sales of the mean marketing cooperative. The corresponding impact on net income is estimated at $3,815 and $17,286, respectively. Following the estimation of further specifications, there is also indication most of the impact is facilitated by older trademarks (>3 years) in the stock, which implies a delayed impact of brand equity on financial performance. Overall, the reported evidence serves as motivation to directors and managers of marketing cooperatives to pursue opportunities to build brand equity. To do so, however, may first require a solution to the equity constraint which appears at the foundation of most farmer cooperatives. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth, using China’s provincial panel data from 1997 to 2014. Design/methodology/approach: Both static fixed effects models and two-step generalized method of moment dynamic panel data models, which control the endogeneity, are employed to identify the causality from RCC credit to agricultural growth in China. Findings: The results show that the credit from RCCs increases the agricultural output significantly. A 1 percent increase in RCC credit leads to agricultural growth of about 0.08 percent, which is robust to various empirical specifications. Further study shows that the contribution of RCC credit to agricultural growth decreases from the most developed eastern region to the least developed western region and increases over time. Research limitations/implications: The results imply that RCC credit is critical in financing agricultural activities by relaxing rural credit constraints and intense competition strengthens the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth by improving managerial efficiency and developing diversified financial products to meet better rural credit demands. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is first empirical study on the effect of RCC credit on agricultural growth despite of many on the role of financial development in agricultural growth. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore resilience strategies of Chinese street vendors in a shifted regulatory policy environment from a strength-based and entrepreneurial perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon nine in-depth interviews and naturalistic observations in an urban village of Guangzhou, China, the study empirically investigates how unregulated sidewalk-based hawkers struggle to survive against socioeconomic adversities compared with regulated vendors’ operations in a legitimate transitional market. Findings: Mirroring a sub-group of rural-to-urban migrants, street vendors espouse subtle strategies centering on purposefulness, resourcefulness and hardiness, which are instantiated through family obligation, sales tactics, merchandising techniques, technology application, trading flexibility, moral sentiment and assistance network. As such, street entrepreneurs are both enacting and constructing resilience in response to specific challenging contexts including impoverishment, operating cost inflation, contingent loss, fierce competition, market uncertainty, intensive workloads, municipal inspection and arbitrary governance practice of village cooperative organization. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding its limited generalizability, the result sheds light on crystallization of street vendors’ resilience and informs social services and policy remedies. Originality/value: The study provides a frame of reference to examine the interplay of resilience theory from psychology and entrepreneurship thesis from the field of business management by adding new evidence to the research on “entrepreneurial resilience” and potentially serves as a catalyst to enrich existing literature with an integrated perspective to comprehend the coping process of these necessity-driven micro-enterprise operators. The antagonistic understanding of informal economy is so predominating that it obscures structural oppression undermining social justice, whereas the spirit of self-reliance among street entrepreneurs is ought to be respected. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Thus, the Common Forests Modernization Act of 1966 was enacted, following successive modernization policies since the Meiji Restoration in 1868. We evaluated the impacts of the past modernization policies on the management of common forests by statistically comparing the performance of modernized and non-modernized 19,690 common forests based on the World Census of Agriculture and Forestry 2000. The performance measures for comparison included planting, weeding, thinning, and harvesting activities. We found less modernized, customary holdings are more active in tending activities such as weeding and thinning, while modernized holdings may have an advantage in harvesting and timber sales. © 2019 The Author(s). 4.0 International Licen.},

Twenty-five intact Washera male lambs were used in both a 90 day feeding trial and a 10 day digestibility study. The treatments compared were: 100% PH (control, = T1); PH + a concentrate mix (CM) (= T2); PH + HGF barley (= T3); PH + HGF oats (= T4); and PH + 50% CM and 50% HGF mixture of barley and oats (= T5). Chemical composition of diets and refusals, feed intake and digestibility of DM and nutrients were recorded. The average HGF fresh biomass yields from 1 kg grain were 5.21 and 6.32 kg for barley and oats, respectively. The CP, NDF, ADF and ADL concentrations in HGF were 13.2, 45.6, 34.8 and 6.7% for barley and 13.7, 46.8, 36.6 and 7.6% for oats. All supplemented treatments had higher total DM intakes (12-21%) than the control (P<0.05) and all supplements produced marked substitution effects for PH (35-51%). Animals on the PH diet lost weight (17 g/d), while all supplemented groups gained weight (58-65 g/d). Partial budget analysis showed that the highest net return was for T5 followed by T2, T4 and T3. Hydroponically-grown oats forage could have potential to replace a commercial concentrate for supplementing sheep on native pastures, but both HGF and concentrates are probably unaffordable for the majority of smallholder farmers engaged in sheep production. Establishment of farmer cooperative hydroponic facilities could spread the overhead costs of the capital infrastructure and this approach should be investigated. © 2019.},

This framework is productive, showing how some Nuevo Mexicano farmers (and others) orient toward farming, sustenance, and human-nature relationships through community, family, heritage, and education. Moreover, in addition to a conceptualization of sustainability as specific practices for nurturing and enduring in environments, communities, and organizations/institutions, sustainability can be understood as embedded ecocultural and historical experience with cross-cultural parallels in land-based communities. This study advances the ethical duty of environmental communication to better understand the ways in which environmental discourse and ecocultural and material realities are imbricated, as well as the call for such discursive study to be grounded in phenomenological experience of the natural world. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

A widespread intervention is the construction of agro-pastoral dams and irrigation schemes in traditionally pastoral communities that face a drying climate. Taking the Maji Moto Maasai community in southern Kenya as a case study, this article demonstrates that water access inequality can lead to a breakdown of pre-existing social capital and former pastoral cooperative structures within a community. When such interventions trigger new water uses, such as farming in former pastoral landscapes, there are no traditional customary institutional structures in place to manage the new water resource. The resulting easily corruptible local water management institutions are a main consolidator of water access inequalities for intervention beneficiaries, where socio-economic standing often determines benefits from interventions. Ultimately, technological adaptation interventions such as agro-pastoral dams may result in tensions and a high fragmentation of adaptive capacity within target communities. © 2018 by the authors.},

Yet, despite Tunisia was at forefront of introducing them, the uptake of SWCT by farmers has been less broad than desired. This study aims to identify and analyze those factors that have affected the rate of adoption of SWCT within the Sidi Bouzid governorate of Central Tunisia; a region that is representative of resource-poor environments within the country, and one where land degradation is of both historical and contemporary concern. Employing a binary logistic regression model, with data obtained from a survey of 250 farmers, our results suggest that socio-economic and institutional factors play an important role in the adoption of SWCT. Membership within an agricultural cooperative was positively correlated with adoption. Surprisingly, however, participation in organized trainings for SWCT was negatively correlated with adoption, similarly to livestock holdings. We provide plausible explanations for this counterintuitive finding, together with an argument that conventional processes for knowledge transfer and dissemination are in need of reform. © 2018, Bononia University Press.

	abstract = {This article aims to analyze the implementation of Agroforestry Systems (AFS) by family farmers, assessing their contribution to agroecological transition and understanding the process of knowledge construction. The study was carried out in family farming farms in the Sumaré Rural Settlement, and in the area of Family Farming and Agroecological Cooperative (Cooperacra), respectively located in the municipalities of Sumaré and Americana, São Paulo State, Brazil. The methodology was based on a case study, using Focal Groups and Field Notes as research instruments. On the basis of our analysis, there were social changes in the farmers’ organization and in the decision-making process, as well as in the landscape in the areas of AFS and surroundings, where agroecological principles were also applied to production. In Sumaré, the four farmers participating in the project organized themselves to obtain organic certification. Cooperacra, which works with a group of 10 farmers advanced in the process of agroecological transition, starting from an intensive organic horticulture production system to a biodiverse agroforestry system. Despite the short time of the project, the construction of knowledge in relation to agroforestry systems was perceived through management techniques incorporated by the farmers in their agroecosystems. The arboreal component, which thus far the farmers had seen as something to be eliminated to realize agriculture, was introduced and became a relevant part of the process. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of AFS in the process of agroecological transition toward a more sustainable agriculture. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {A 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit Lushan county of Ya’an city, Sichuan Province, China, on 20 April 2013. The Lushan earthquake damage is less than the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake’s, where 70,000 houses collapsed and 2 million people across nineteen prefectures and 115 counties of Sichuan province were affected. Temple Village (fictitious name), an old village in S township, was chosen as an intervention site. As most young adults went to work in the city, the old community became dilapidated and its traditional culture, architecture, custom, skill and wisdom were dying. Social workers were unable to tackle fully this community’s multiple needs, especially those associated with environmental and physical spaces linked to notions of belonging and identity, on their own. A transdisciplinary action research team in which social workers operated hand in hand with the disciplines of architectural design became the means for exploring an alternative model of post-disaster community reconstruction that would enhance the quality of life of left-behind people in this disaster-affected community. Working together, the research team facilitated the formation of a community kitchen project that enabled villagers to create a new building and co-operative organisations for the village’s long-term sustainable development. This paper presents the participatory design process, contribution of green social work and transdisciplinary interventions in post-disaster community reconstruction. © The Author 2017.

Further, the special attributes of fresh agriculture products and unpredictable emergencies make agricultural supply chain likely subject to supply chain disruption risk, and these disruptions are extreme, although occurring with low frequencies, which leads to the shortage of downstream enterprises and customers, even severely reduces the performance of whole agricultural supply chain. The paper studies on the supply disruption risk problem faced by the supermarket’s purchasing. Assume a two-level option-based agricultural supply chain, which is consisted of the agricultural cooperative and the supermarket. Through numerical examples, compare the performance of different purchasing strategies (single, traditional dual, dual based on option contracts) under the setting of supply disruptions. The results show which under the supply disruption, the dual sourcing outperforms the single sourcing; the dual sourcing with option contracts brings flexibility, and maximizes the profit of the supermarket, which is the better purchasing strategy to prevent and avoid the disruption of a supply chain, providing decision-making reference for supermarket. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.},

	abstract = {Climbing beans offer potential for sustainable intensification in the East-African highlands, but their introduction requires a major change in the cropping system compared with the commonly grown bush bean. We explored farm-level opportunities, constraints and trade-offs for climbing bean cultivation in the eastern highlands of Uganda. We established current food self-sufficiency, income, investment costs and labour, and assessed the ex-ante, farm-level impact of four climbing bean options on these indicators. Input for this assessment were a detailed characterization of 16 farms of four types, and on-farm, experimental data of adaptation trials of climbing bean. Climbing beans generally improved food self-sufficiency and income, but often required increased financial investment and always demanded more labour than current farm configurations. Opportunities for integration of climbing beans on small farms were limited. Although some of the poorest farmers accrued the largest absolute benefits from climbing beans, their ability to make the necessary investments is questionable. The analysis was translated into a simple-to-use modelling tool to enable participatory analysis of the outcomes with farmers of the four farm types to understand their perspectives and decision-making. The discussions revealed a recent increase in market prices for climbing bean resulting in growing interest in their cultivation in the eastern highlands. A lack of seed and stakes was limiting climbing bean cultivation, and a sufficient amount of climbing bean seed needs to be ensured through strengthening of farmer cooperatives and improved storage. © 2018 The Authors},

We make novel contributions to the literature by employing a recently developed selectivity-corrected stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to address possible self-selection biases stemming from both observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that TE for cooperative members ranges from 79 to 86 per cent and that for non-members ranges from 74 to 84 per cent, depending on how biases are controlled. In addition, the efficiency levels of both members and non-members of cooperatives appear to be underestimated if the selectivity bias is not appropriately addressed. Our findings conclude that the average TE is consistently higher for cooperative members relative to their counterparts, highlighting the positive role of contemporary agricultural cooperatives in promoting efficient usage of production inputs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Abstract: The ‘managed-metabolism’ hypothesis suggests that a ‘cooperation barrier’ must be overcome if self-producing chemical organizations are to undergo the transition from non-life to life. This dynamical barrier prevents un-managed autocatalytic networks of molecular species from individuating into complex, cooperative organizations. The barrier arises because molecular species that could otherwise make significant cooperative contributions to the success of an organization will often not be supported within the organization, and because side reactions and other ‘free-riding’ processes will undermine cooperation. As a result, the barrier seriously impedes the emergence of individuality, complex functionality and the transition to life. This barrier is analogous to the cooperation barrier that also impedes the emergence of complex cooperation at all levels of living organization. As has been shown at other levels of organization, the barrier can be overcome comprehensively by appropriate ‘management’. Management implements a system of evolvable constraints that can overcome the cooperation barrier by ensuring that beneficial co-operators are supported within the organization and by suppressing free-riders. In this way, management can control and manipulate the chemical processes of a collectively autocatalytic organization, producing novel processes that serve the interests of the organization as a whole and that could not arise and persist in an un-managed chemical organization. Management self-organizes because it is able to capture some of the benefits that are produced when its interventions promote cooperation, thereby enhancing productivity. Selection will therefore favour the emergence of managers that take over and manage chemical organizations so as to overcome the cooperation barrier. The managed-metabolism hypothesis demonstrates that if management is to overcome the cooperation barrier comprehensively, its interventions must be digitally coded. In this way, the hypothesis accounts for the two-tiered structure of all living cells in which a digitally-coded genetic apparatus manages an analogically-informed metabolism.

	abstract = {Purpose: The financial crisis of 2008 resulted in calls for change. Commentators suggested that co-operatives, in particular credit unions, could provide accountability and sustainability through their open governance and mutual status. However, such suggestions assumed that co-operative principles and practice continued to underpin the efficacy of co-operative banking, and that credit unions, one of the most prevalent forms of co-operative banking, could offer a viable financial alternative. Instead, in the case of Cyprus, the financial crisis and the associated aftershocks triggered the nationalisation and demutualisation of credit unions. This prompted the researchers to question both the viability of a co-operative banking future and the extent to which co-operative principles were shaping decision making, governance, accountability and sustainability. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was adopted to explore the degree to which co-operative principles still shaped credit union thinking and stakeholder relationships. Findings: As is the case elsewhere within the co-operative movement, the findings point the fact that governance is weaken by the low membership participation and that the principles are no longer universally applied. Credit unions, if not co-operative banking, may not offer the financial assurances that commentators have called for. Moreover, the guiding principles may no longer be embedded within the fabric of the movement. Practical implications: Findings are important for practitioners/supervisory body as they highlight possible impacts on co-operative’ future and especially on their governance model and level of autonomy and independence in case of state intervention. Originality/value: The research undertaken is original as it is the first time credit unions in Cyprus were examined for adherence to co-operative principles. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The power generation of a wind farm depends on the efficiency of the individual wind turbines of the farm. In large wind farms, wind turbines usually affect each other aerodynamically at some specific wind directions. Previous studies suggest that a way to maximize the power generation of these wind farms is to reduce the generation of the first rows wind turbines to allow the next rows to generate more power (coordinated case). Yet, other studies indicate that the maximum generation of the wind farm is reached when every wind turbine works at its individual maximum power coefficient CPmax (individual case). This article studies this paradigm and proposes a practical method to evaluate when the wind farm needs to be controlled according to the individual or the coordinated case. The discussion is based on basic principles, numerical computations, and wind tunnel experiments. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Academics and development practitioners increasingly view cooperatives as the cornerstone for agricultural transformation and poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa. Cooperatives play a crucial role in promoting bulk storage and sale by smallholder farmers, which can play a major role in poverty reduction for farmers otherwise unable to commercialize. Despite the significant role of cooperatives, the reforms associated with economic liberalisation have caused many cooperatives in the region to fail. While efforts were made in Uganda to ameliorate this situation through the passing of the National Co-operative Policy (NCP), this has done little to enhance the survival of these cooperatives. In this opinion paper, we identify challenges faced by cooperatives that negatively impact performance and survival, such political interference, lack of administrative support, human resource constraints, inadequate knowledge of the operations by members and poor governance. This paper recommends stronger linkages between the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives and the Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF). Integrating cooperatives into the decentralisation framework and formalising existing village savings and loan association groups into formal cooperatives. Most importantly, the government needs to take on a more proactive approach toward cooperative development, as seen in some countries such as South Africa and Rwanda. © Afr. J. Food Agric. Nutr.

	abstract = {As Social Economy financial institutions, credit unions have traditionally been considered less efficient than traditional banking entities. However, like banks and savings banks, they have to be as efficient and competitive as possible to survive in today’s business environment, especially at times of crisis. To date, there have been very few studies on their efficiency and practically none for the crisis period. Moreover, almost all the existing studies assess only financial efficiency, without considering their social function. This study examines the levels of both financial and social efficiency in Spanish credit unions as well as their main determinants during the recent crisis. We apply the two-stage double bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology based on panel data corresponding to all the credit unions active in Spain between 2008 and 2013. The empirical results indicate that financial and social efficiency achieved an acceptable level, although on average the former was slightly greater than the latter. We also find that both age and merger and acquisition activity were positively influential on the financial efficiency of credit unions but had a significant negative effect on their social efficiency. Moreover, the regional location of such entities and the financial crisis were also crucial determinants of both types of efficiency. Our findings are therefore useful for all the stakeholders of credit unions to know if these entities have been efficient according to a double bottom line accounting in the crisis period and hence to maintain successful social management that is compatible with satisfactory financial efficiency. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {An important issue facing marketing cooperatives is that the overall quality of the product depends on the quality of farm products provided by individual members. We conduct an experiment to empirically investigate producer incentives to free-ride on quality among the members of a marketing cooperative in a setting where the average quality provided by cooperative members results in a collective rent that is distributed back to members in a patronage dividend levied in proportion to the quantity produced. Hidden actions by cooperative members that impact quality are imperfectly monitored, but free-riding, when detected, results in exclusion from cooperative returns. The randomized payoff structure of our game results in a novel experimental design that nests public good games and multi-player assurance games. Our findings indicate that free-riding on product quality is deterred when (a) cooperatives base patronage dividends on quality outcomes of smaller groups; (b) payoffs from free-riding are randomized by the possibility of exclusion from cooperative returns; and (c) cooperatives distribute a larger share of returns to members through indirect payments such as capital pooling and cost-sharing arrangements unrelated to product quality. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {The lack of a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for worker cooperatives is one of the main causes for their scarcity in the USA, as it causes ignorance and uncertainty even though cooperatives are one of several forms of doing business recognized by the Internal Revenue Code (like sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, LLC's, and Subchapter S corporations). Tax laws divide businesses into those categories, each with its own special tax provisions and worker cooperatives try to fit into any of those forms of business while "acting on a cooperative basis", thus, having their own specificities. Even though at a State level there are regulations for agricultural cooperatives in all States, there are only less than 30 States that have either worker cooperative regulations, general cooperative regulations or consumer regulations which worker cooperatives can use. However, the situation in the USA now demands for these entities. The fact that a particular attention is being given to worker cooperatives as an aftermath of the recent crisis is not news, as we have seen, historically2, cooperatives have traditionally emerged in situations where the public sector was unable to provide the response required by the people, for instance in support for financial access, housing, or decent livelihoods. As ZEULI and CROPP3 state it: "The historical development of cooperative businesses cannot be disconnected from the social and economic forces that shaped them. Co-ops then, as now, were created in times and places of economic stress and social upheaval". Different studies4 during the previous recession show how worker cooperatives increase their turnover and number of jobs, while other enterprises shrink, being this the reason why their study at this moment becomes a must. Thus, there should be a minimum understanding and control of what a worker cooperative is in order to be able to register and act like a real worker cooperative. Quoting GUTNECHT5 "allowing something that is not a cooperative to call itself a cooperative squanders a precious asset - the goodwill and public trust that reposes in the word 'cooperative'". Thus, the USA is missing a very important instrument in order to fight against unemployment, inequality, income maldistribution and unsustainable development at a time when there is a conscience by a majority of the population in different movements that demand a change. This change is possible if educational, cultural and legal issues are properly addressed, as it has been done in other countries and higher instances6, creating a fairer, equitable and more cohesive and sustainable society, thus a better world to live in. This paper aims to conduct a comparative statutory research on cooperative law for worker cooperatives in the USA, with a view of promoting an increased understanding within the academic and governmental communities, at a national and international level in order to promote worker cooperatives. In the case of New York public policies tacking this issue are already being devised. If this goal is achieved we will all benefit from them. © 2019 University of Deusto. All rights reserved.},

Industrial organization and new institutional economics theories explain the existence of agricultural cooperatives and farmers’ participation in them through their ability to develop ‘countervailing power’ within markets and internalizing transaction costs, respectively. Using a unique dataset that includes community, cooperative, and household level survey data, this study empirically investigates the drivers of agricultural cooperatives formation and farmers’ membership and patronage decisions in Ethiopia. The results indicate that agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia tend to exist in locations that are connected to major roads with relatively well-developed market structures, supporting the industrial organization argument linked to market power for their formation more than the new institutionalists argument linked to overcoming potential contractual failures. A farm household's decision to join and use agricultural cooperatives, on the other hand, is strongly related to their location, scale of operation, specialization, and human and relational capital. A household's membership and patronage decisions are also affected by the size, specialization, and integration of the agricultural cooperative itself. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Partnership discourse is making advances in development dialogue as a means to improve the livelihoods of the agrarian populace. In Papua New Guinea, productive partnerships flourished during the early growth of the coffee industry. After the demise of plantations and rural mills in the lead up to political independence, the support services that plantations used to provide to smallholders, including centralised processing, have ceased as have price incentives for quality. Consequently, smallholders began to produce coffee of inconsistent quality and their productivity has also declined. However, coffee value chain partnerships have the potential to reverse the present decline of coffee production and increase the productivity of coffee farmers and address the inconsistency and the supply of low-grade coffee. Using two case studies of farmer cooperatives, we investigate collective action and also assess partnerships among present value chain actors. The case studies were supported with interviews of value chain actors to gain further insights into partnerships with farmer groups. This paper illustrates that through collective action and partnerships, coffee farmers can improve coffee production and quality, enhance governance systems in grower groups, attract community development services and diversify into other entrepreneurial activities. © 2019 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

For this research, a questionnaire was used to collect information on soil management and the use of agricultural terraces. Data collection was completed with 145 landowners and NTS users, along with rural extension and agricultural cooperatives. The results demonstrated that the return of erosion is likely due to the absence of crop rotation in favor of repetitive year-to-year planting of the same plant species (early soybean/maize [second harvest]/wheat), soil revolving to decompress the surface layer, and the elimination of agricultural terraces and the consequential downslope planting. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

However, less work has examined the role of symbolic values in these processes. Drawing on extensive fieldwork, this research examines the relationship between value and identity frames and resource access in three food and agriculture cooperatives that aim for community improvement. We find that as cultural and symbolic power become concentrated, diverse cultural values, and the potential resources they represent, can become more difficult to enact. While sustained dialog during a frame process can help bridge diverse resources, additional resources are often needed to support such activities. Our work suggests that frames are related to resource access, that they can be in tension with each other, do not always reflect practice, and may help reorganize capitals access. © 2018, © 2018 Community Development Society.},

Previous researches suggest that the performance of the cooperatives is determined by their organizational design. Thus, this fact imposes the need to examine if the organizational models applied by the agricultural cooperatives affect their profitability outcome. This is the first Greek survey on performance contrasting traditional agricultural cooperatives and cooperatives with capital-seeking entities. Financial data of 34 cooperative organizations were used in a profitability equation, estimated with generalized error-structure model for a 5-years period. The findings show that there are differences in the economic results and the factors affecting profitability between these two types of cooperatives, providing evidence that the organizational type affects performance. The results also indicate that there exists management inefficiency especially for the traditional cooperatives. Based on the particular findings, cooperative practitioners and policymakers could advance their knowledge in order to boost performance level in cooperatives. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The water resources-water environment carrying capacity (WR-WECC) is an important indicator for judging the regional macro-control ability of water resources. The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is related closely to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resources rational exploitation, coupled human and environment, and ecological protection priority. Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade‐offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 2013–2015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Data about the generation of empty pesticide containers (EPC) is scarce, even in countries where an EPC collection system is applied. In most cases, data refers to the total amount of EPC collected, which is lower than EPC generated depending on the extent of application of the collection project. Moreover, results are not correlated to the kind of crops, area and number of farmers involved, making impossible to use them elsewhere. This study aims at estimating EPC generation indices. It focuses on the indirect assessment of EPC generation based on information given by the agronomists of agricultural supplies stores and agricultural cooperatives (stakeholders) consulting farmers. For the study area (Pella prefecture in Greece), EPC waste production was estimated for arable crops, fruits and vegetables and it was found to range from 0.9 to 35.3 pieces/hectare depending on the crop type. The weight of empty plastic pesticide containers (EPPCweight) indices were calculated at 0.97 kg/ha and 4.36 kg/farmer/year which are close to the scarce available literature data. These results can be the basis for the design of an EPC management program in areas where data of this type of wastes is lacking. Other results of this survey indicate that stakeholders (depending on their capacity) could be motivated to organize and operate EPC collection stations as well as to help farmers to comply with the national management plan. Based on the above findings, three alternative scenarios for EPC management are proposed to provide a basis for designing an applicable regional EPC management program. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, previous literature has mixed results on the relationship between quantity growth and service supply effect of cooperatives. By conducting multiple correspondence analysis, descriptive statistics, and Pearson's chi-square test on survey data of 785 farmers, this paper aims to describe the characteristics of cooperatives' members and evaluate the current state of cooperatives' service supply from a demand-supply perspective. The results of the survey show that male, middle-aged, and middle-class farmers or farmers who plant local optimal crops are more likely to become the members of cooperatives. There is a huge gap between service supply and demand of farmers; cooperatives have a positive effect on reducing the degree of service demand. This effect is only significant when concerning sale, pest control, and mechanization. On the whole, there is a weak correlative relationship between the current service supply of cooperatives and the service demand of farmers in China. © 2018 by the authors.},

This toxic invasive plant prefers drier agricultural fields or grasslands. The aim of this paper was to study the distribution and population dynamics of H. mantegazzianum and to evaluate its management measures taken in the town of Spišská Stará Ves in the Kežmarok district located in northern Slovakia. H. mantegazzianum has successfully spread in the cadastral area of Spišská Stará Ves in the buffer zone of the national park of Pieniny. The total area of the PIENAP and its buffer zone invaded by H. mantegazzianum was approximately 457,000 m2. The research took place in 2013, on an area colonized by the species (28,900 m2) located on the land of the former agricultural cooperative farm. The taxon has spread mainly on abandoned areas (64.7% of the total area occupied by H. mantegazzianum), on permanent grasslands (28%) and along the banks of the Dunajec river (7.3%), where it formed polycenoses with a group dispersion. The population density of H. mantegazzianum decreased by about 46% on the research sites after the management measures provided in July 2013.

	abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the optimal strategies for both centralized and decentralized modes in a two-echelon omni-channel organic agricultural supply chain (OASC) which consists of one farmer cooperative and one online retailer. Furthermore, the contracts of cooperation between the members in OASC are discussed. Based on both theory differential game and bi-level programming, we utilize the Nerlove-Arrow model and Stackelberg model to examine five cases of decision modes for both agents in the OASC. Then, we achieve the optimal strategies where the specified sets of organic growing effort, organic traceability technology effort, propaganda input, and service input can guarantee the maximization of the related profits. As a result, we could obtain the values of the corresponding optimal profits. For the centralized decision mode, the farmer cooperative and the online retailer make decisions with the goal of maximizing the overall profits of the OASC. Meanwhile, for the decentralized decision mode with four different cases, each member will independently make a decision with the goal of maximizing his own profit respectively. In detail, as for the fully decentralized decision mode, no contracts exist in OASC; regarding the decentralized decision mode with an information traceability cost sharing contract, two members pay the information traceability cost together; and for the decentralized decision mode with a revenue sharing contract, two members share the revenue together; as to the decentralized decision mode with a comprehensive contract, there are two cooperative ways that information traceability cost sharing and revenue sharing can be achieved. In addition, we also considered factors such as the consumer preferences of organic products and the cross influence between channels in models. Finally, through sensitivity analysis and comparison of optimal strategies and profits, we found that: (1) high consumer preferences of organic products and high cross influence between channels are profitable; and (2) the choice of contract is influenced by the relative size of the offline marginal income ratio and the online marginal income ratio. © 2019 by the authors.},

Theories of corporate governance provided propositions that were used as a starting-point for interviews held with board chairmen in thirteen Swedish agricultural cooperatives. The results show that cooperatives benefit from larger boards than suggested by most governance literature.

	abstract = {This paper compares the cases of Seonheul 1-ri and Gasi-ri, where communities were built based on commons, but commons ownership modes were different. Seonheul 1-ri built a community based on "Dongbaekdongsan" owned by Jeju-do and the central government, while Gasi-ri built a community based on a common pasture owned by a farm association. In comparing these two cases, this paper will discuss how the difference in ownership modes affected the community building and commons management methods. This paper shows that a village's ownership of the commons may paradoxically interfere with the formation of a stable commons management body in some cases. Whereas the farm cooperative association, of which the members are 270 village residents, has the ownership of the common pasture in the case of Gasi-ri, the central government owns "Dongbaekdongsan" in the case of Seonheul 1-ri. Although both villages successfully built communities, in the case of Gasi-ri, the members of the village council, which is the commons management body, are divided into association members and non-association members. In the case of Seonheul 1-ri, all members of the village are equal in their statuses in the village council since there is no farm cooperative association with the ownership of commons. Therefore, the community of Seonheul 1-ri has a good structure for immigrants to settle into. The non-association members who have actively participated in community building in Gasi-ri are leaving, and thus the population of Gasi-ri is stagnant. On the contrary, the population of Seonheul 1-ri is increasing rapidly as the number of immigrating residents grows. Even when the village manages the commons, conflicts can be amplified in cases where some of the residents, or the association to which some but not all of the residents belong, owns the commons. Due to the inequality between persons with and without ownership, the managing body of the commons can become unstable. To stably promote community building, the commons should be owned by the village or the villagers rather than by outsiders, an enterprise, or the state. However, even when the village or the villagers have the ownership of the commons, if there is inequality among village residents around the commons it may interfere with community building or the maintenance of the sustainability of the commons. On the contrary, if the commons is expropriated by the government and the right of the village to stably manage the commons is guaranteed although the village does not have first-hand ownership, a community can be built and the sustainability of the commons can be maintained for a long time because the residents are equal. To manage the commons effectively to remain sustainable hereafter, village residents should be continuously filled, and to this end the village council should have an equal and open structure. © 2015 The Institute for Social Development and Policy Research.},

	abstract = {Agricultural cooperatives in China, known as “Farmers’ Professional Cooperatives” (FPCs), are becoming popular and have been intensely promoted by the Chinese government to improve the economic welfare of small farmers. However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice-producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

	abstract = {In the Sahelian region of West Africa, pearl millet, which is a major subsistence food crop supporting families' livelihoods, is regularly attacked by the millet head miner/spike worm, Heliocheilus (=Raghuva) albipunctella de Joannis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The pest infestation levels, damage ratings, and yield losses vary within and among countries because of differences in millet cultivars, the planting period, the onset time and seasonal distribution of rains, synchronization of moth flight with head development stages, and pest control practices. Egg laying by moths and the distribution of larval populations are governed by the development stages of millet head and the soil type. Rainfall patterns affect the distribution of diapaused pupae. The implications of this information for future pest control strategies are discussed in this review. Control measures including the planting of pest tolerant/resistant cultivars, the application of chemical pesticides, and the abundance of natural enemies have had significant impacts on larval mortality but have limited application. In recent years, augmentative releases of the larval ectoparasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), have been tested in a pilot project in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. Because of the success of the program and the increasing demand for parasitoids farmers cooperatives are being engaged in producing parasitoids for the large-scale distribution of 'ready-to-use' bags containing braconids. This would sustain continuous availability and generate profitable businesses. To achieve this goal, farmers' economic problems and technical challenges need to be resolved at the village level, and marketing avenues need to be established. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The relevance of this scientific problem is that support of small-scale farming in Ukraine is very important for the social and economic development of the country. To develop optimal marketing and management policies for rural farmers, it is necessary to determine the challenges arise in Ukrainian small-scale farming towards its path to economic development. In order to determine important factors for small Ukrainian farmers, 120 small-scale farmers from Dnipropetrovs’k region involved in dairy, honey and vegetable production were surveyed. Among the respondents there were men and women aged 23-64, having a farm, family farm or a personal peasant household. Farmers were asked to name 3 challenges that matter, and indicate the strength of their influence (weak, average or strong). In addition, 10 personal interviews with farmers were conducted in order to find out more details about the responses in the questionnaires. The study identified two major groups of challenges for small-scale Ukrainian farmers. They are challenges in production process and marketing. The study showed that in order to manage these challenges and support the development of small-scale farming in Ukraine, the following recommendations can be made: farmers need to participate actively in the development of their own community and local production; cooperation has proved successful for dairy, vegetable, berries and cereals producers; it is necessary to keep on supporting the decentralization policy in small communities; it is necessary to ensure the protection of the small-scale farmers’ rights after abolition of the moratorium on the land sale, and at the same time, to control the use of these lands; it is important to choose agricultural systems safer for land and water, than the traditional system of agriculture in Ukraine; it is important for farmers to pay attention to their managerial qualities and upgrade them through constant education and training; local community leaders need to strengthen support for rural youth in order to reduce their migration to major cities. The results of the research can be useful for small-scale farmers, rural community leaders and agricultural cooperatives’ members. © 2019 University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest.

We also report forecasts of cooperative sustainability given expected changes to membership heterogeneity. The data this study used are from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Economic Research Service (ERS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) joined with USDA-Rural Development cooperative financial data at the state level. Membership heterogeneity was found to be less relevant than other variables included in the model for predicting cooperative business volume and number of cooperatives headquartered per state, and an estimate of cooperative sustainability. Membership heterogeneity effects were mostly offsetting given expected changes to member heterogeneity, and/or were offset due to changes to other macro factors. Consequently, we conclude membership heterogeneity may affect the number of cooperatives and extent consistent with theoretical literature at a micro level; however, we also expect a similar level of sustainability of cooperatives at an aggregate level in the near-term despite changes to membership heterogeneity. © 2018 by the authors.},

The results show that members are not able to govern a collectively owned firm that is large and complex; members are thus reluctant to invest in co-operatives; and members do not perceive that co-operatives benefit them economically.

	abstract = {While scholars who study issues of food justice use the term food power rarely—if at all—their arguments often position the rise of the food justice movement in the context of food power that sustains oppression in the food system. Similarly, many food justice activists and organizations produce an analysis of oppressive forms of food power, while placing the goals of the movement to create sustainable community-based interventions in the periphery. Yet, the pursuit of food justice is a dual process related to power. This process is characterized by the simultaneous acts of dismantling oppressive forms of food power and building emancipatory forms of food power. It also has deep roots in the historical arc of food politics in the Black Freedom Struggle of the civil rights era. However, we know very little about this dual process and how black communities engage in it. In this paper, I juxtapose two cases of black farm projects—the historical case of Freedom Farms Cooperative (FFC) in Mississippi and the contemporary case of the Rocky Acres Community Farm (RACF) in New York—to explore the dual process of food justice. I conclude with a brief discussion on what the cases teach us about this dual process and its implications for scholars and activists who work on issues of food justice. Such implications provide insights into the possibilities of the food justice movement in the future and challenge the movement to include, more explicitly, issues of race, land, self-determination, and economic autonomy. © 2019 by the Author.},

Using cross-sectional household data and Cragg’s regression model, we identified the determinants of side selling by coffee cooperative farmers in southwest Ethiopia. The bootstrapping technique was applied to extract average partial effects from the model coefficients. Certified, elder and educated farmers who have off-farm income and trust in the cooperative leadership have been found to side-sell significantly less. Nonetheless, cooperative group size and late payment favoured more side selling. Based on these findings, possible interventions are highlighted for improving cooperative members’ commitment and the performance of coffee cooperatives in the region. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Kenya's Arabica coffee is highly rated in the world and is a major source of income for over half a million smallholder farmers. Production has declined by 50% over the past 25 years despite efforts by initiatives. This study tries to unravel what drives coffee production in Kenya. Data were collected on six cooperatives through household interviews and discussions with farmers, cooperative officials, and key informants. Yields ranged from ten to 3889 kg/ha/year, averaged 474 kg/ha/year and were positively correlated with intensity of crop management (r = 0.09, P < 0.05). Coffee represented about 25–50% of total household income. The oldest farmers (average 63 years) were poorer, had less diversified income sources and managed coffee less intensively than younger farmers. Intensity of management differed among cooperatives and was positively correlated with trust in the cooperative (r = 0.209, P < 0.001). Households that received credit from marketers were 30% more likely to use fertilizers than other households. We show that the yield gap can be closed by existing practices, and intensification is influenced by household characteristics and services received. We conclude that increasing the participation of young farmers in coffee production and creating an enabling environment for intensification can have a positive and sustainable effect on national production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This is particularly true in Italy, a Mediterranean country with a strong agricultural tradition and a great interest in the food market. The largest market weight in terms of food retail in Italy is held by national chains linked to the cooperative movement (Coop and Conad) that has promised to ensure more collaborative and less imbalanced relationships between producers and distributors, along with a stronger connection to the territory and socially responsible corporate management. The Coop is currently the biggest cooperative in Italy. Its increasing power in the Italian food retail system has caused it to behave like an oligopoly that has exploited its proximity to left-wing parties to obtain an advantageous position in some markets (ex: Emilia, Liguria, etc.). Equally alarming is a growing financialization which has led to the bankruptcy of CoopCa and Coop Operaie of Trieste, affecting approximately 20,000 investors. The recent crisis in food retail is redirecting firms' strategies and producing new forms of food distribution such as Alternative Food Networks that are trying to restore the mission and values of the old consumer cooperatives. © 2018 by the authors.},

The results revealed that Khao Hin Sorn Agricultural Cooperative Rice Mill Ltd. is royal patronage which is supported by various agencies such as the Cooperative Promotion Department, and Land Development Department. This cooperative collected paddy from 10 farmer members, with average amount of paddy at 14 tons per year, and the paddy were delivered to the cooperative rice mill for processing. The full mill capacity is 1.2 ton of paddy per day. The service charge rate is one Thai baht per kilogram. The cooperative has produced rice in both packaging and non-packaging for sale to consumers by themselves. Regarding the SWOT analysis results, concerning the strengths, the cooperative rice mill was royal patronage that can provide inexpensive milling service charge for farmers. Additionally, operation staff had experience in rice milling for a long time. Whilst the weaknesses were the rice mill without checked the quality of paddy before milling-process and did not have the specialized technicians to repair a milling machine as well as budget deficit. In terms of the opportunities, the rice mill had a wide range of support from organizations of budgeting, staff, and administration. Moreover, farmers was preferred consuming rice grown by their own. Finally, the threats were the rice mill which located in a non-rice-farming area, and it operated less than the full milling capacity. The collaboration with supply chain partners should be encouraged to increase the quantity of paddy for the milling process. © 2018 International Journal of Agricultural Technology.All rights reserved.},

The research findings are as follows: (1) Based on the management of most Savings and Credit Cooperatives in Thailand's central region-lack of planning, strategic management, professionalism, and the participation of staff and members-the shared value of principles and philosophy of the Savings and Credit Cooperatives are found. Moreover, the Cooperatives pay higher attention to quantitative success, in terms of the financial stability of the Cooperatives rather than to the qualitative success on the well-being of the Cooperatives' members. (2) Factors affecting the management of the Cooperatives to empower community economic strength in Thailand's central region includes: awareness and insight into the principles and the philosophy of the cooperatives together with the participation of the Cooperatives' members; and trust and faith in the Cooperatives, good governance and transparency of the operation, including the four keys of resource management-Man, Money, Material/Equipment and Management-with Information Technology systems and government. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

The increasing competition from banking and non-banking financial institutions implies credit unions must provide financial products and services with a clear understanding of factors that interact in this competitive industry. This paper evaluates the discretional and non-discretional factors that tend to influence loans credit unions grant their members. From fixed effect model estimate, discretional factors such as size, profitability, management quality and solvency positively associate with credit union loan business whiles loan loss, net worth, non-loan income and non-loan activities associate negatively. Contractionary monetary policy creates an increase in loan demand in the credit union. Credit union managers should monitor developments taking place in the loanable funds market as increasing overhead cost of banks may imply a possible increase in loan demand leading to diseconomies of scale.

This paper targets at exploiting factors predicting the way that farmers use chemical input, based on first-hand data from 145 vegetable farmers with the membership of cooperatives in China. The role of social capital is investigated beyond traditional determinants. There are three indicators of social capital adopted in this paper, communication of technology and market information, trust, and members’ awareness of common goals. We identify three ways of chemical input use in field investigation. They are using chemical input according to own experience and the instruction on the package, under the guidance of the government, and under the guidance and monitoring of cooperatives. The findings of empirical analysis highlight the role of social capital in influencing the way farmers use chemical input. The awareness of common goals incentivizes farmers to use fertilizer under the guidance of the government and cooperatives, while all the three aspects of social capital are significantly associated with the way that farmers use pesticide. To be specific, farmers in a cooperative with a higher level of communication, trust, and common goals display the tendency to using chemical input based on external guidance rather than own experience. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Consequently, cooperatives studies have tended to examine economic outcomes, such as productivity and job security, comparing them to conventional business firms. Nevertheless, cooperatives are membership associations and have organizational characteristics in common with other types of voluntary associations. Furthermore, one explicit organizational principle of cooperatives is concern for community, and their contributions to the community have been covered frequently by media. Therefore, it is imperative to examine cooperative members’ community engagement, and compare it to other types of association members. Using a national sample of Venezuelans, the relationships between association memberships and community involvement were compared across different types of associations. The results showed that cooperative members had a higher likelihood of being involved in community matters than those from other types of associations. Although the Venezuelan cooperatives have received vast support from the Chavez government for community development, this result can have an implication on the cooperatives’ organizational identity as those who provide members with resources necessary for civic engagement beyond the organizations. © 2017 Eastern Sociological Society},

We found that the cooperative sector in Mongolia is strongly affected by the governmental policy regarding wool subsidies, which provides subsidies only to cooperative members and has consequently caused rapid growth in the number of new, free-riding cooperative members and led to very low levels of members’ self-identification with their cooperatives. This policy also affects the inner organizational structures of cooperatives. Further, we found indications that poorer farmers tend not to be members of cooperatives and that the overall benefits for non-members and the general community arising from local cooperatives are rather low. © 2017 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2017 CIRIEC},

A study of social management was carried out in 60 savings and credit cooperatives in Pichincha, Ecuador, to determine if this is carried out under sustainability principles, with the determination that the recognition of social responsibility and the integral management of the economic and social issues, depends on the segment to which they belong, in which the non-definition of the social budget has a negative influence. The ignorance of the partners about the principles of Cooperativism; the inexistence of Cooperative Education Committees, specifically environmental education and action programs; the lack of granting credits for partner undertakings and the non-application of the cooperative social balance sheet are also other issues that damage the correct functioning of these associative forms. There were recognized areas to be strengthened to guarantee the sustainability of cooperatives as an associative form, such as the definition of social objectives; the active participation of the partners in decision-making and of another two interest groups (families and community). © 2018 General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.},

One approach hereby is to use multi-stakeholder innovation systems, such as the ‘Nicaraguan Learning Al-liance’ (NLA). However, tools for the evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems are rare. This paper reports on the implementation of a conceptual framework to carry out an impact evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems using the NLA as the object of study. The assessment focused on the business relationship constructs of trust and capacity development. Survey interviews, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions collected data from agribusiness stakeholders linked with the NLA and from a control group of stakeholders involved with other networks. The quantitative data were analysed through factor and regression analyses. Results from the quantitative analyses were triangulated with qualitative data. The analysis shows that the NLA has been successful in developing smallholder farmers’ capacities as a result of trust developed through its dedicated project managers. Nonetheless, the NLA has not been more successful at developing agribusiness capacities among Nicaraguan farmers than other networks with the same goals. Results from this study point to the need for facilitating more interactions between the different networks of farmers’ cooperatives and organisations with other stakeholders already active within the Nicaraguan agrifood innovation system. © 2018, Kassel University Press GmbH.

Like traditional security spaces around the world, global cyberspace is also an anarchy system with no absolute authority or institutional status. In such a situation, based on cyber sovereignty and cyber power, the state tries to create an institution applicable to domestic and international cyberspace to make a cyber system favorable to the state itself. Since, unlike traditional power, cyber power has both material and non-material elements, a state cannot know the level of another state's cyber power. For this reason, conflicts among states in the cyber domain are intensifying. The most active states competing for the upper hand in cyberspace are the United States and China. They lead to different levels of recognition and strategies concerning the cyber domain. While the competition between the United States and China invites conflict, it also triggers temporary cooperation among states. The UN's cybersecurity activities are also fragmented by various inter-government institutions and management organizations. However, the differences in strategy between the United States and China affect other states. Ultimately, although the direction of discussions on cybersecurity has been set based on the Group of Government Experts activities in the UN and the need for inter-state cooperation has been acknowledged, such cooperation would be only temporary because states consider domestic policy and strategy to be more important than international or regional cooperative organizations. © 2017 Center for International Studies, Inha University},

Data were collected from a maguey pulquero cooperative society through the use of a strategic planning and investment instrument. The commercial diagnostic phases, market research and products portfolio design were considered. To obtain information for the portfolio, a productive chain analysis was conducted, considering productive links, post-harvest management and commercialisation. Market research was done in two important market centres in influential regions, where knowledge and frequency of consumption of maguey pulquero products was identified. The Boston Consulting Group Matrix was used to integrate the portfolio’s products and by-products, and the Ansoff Matrix was employed to determine the product’s positioning. Finally, an investment and economic viability analysis of the products portfolio was carried out. Six products were identified, with pulque and agave syrup being the investment priority products owing to the profits they generate. Penca, ixtle and paper generate complementary income. The strategies for pulque and agave syrup are market penetration, and the strategies for the remaining products are market and product development. The analysis of products include positive-to-net present value, investment return rate and cost benefit ratio. © 2018 Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare di Firenze. All rights reserved.},

According to the economic theory of cooperativism, the results show that these entities come closer to the pecking order theory, i.e. policies that maximise the prices received by members to the detriment of the entity's self-financing abilities, coupled with restrictions on cooperatives' equity capital that may lead them to use debt to fund growth. The results also show positive relationships between cooperatives' indebtedness and other factors, such as investments in non-current assets, liquidity and cooperative size in terms of turnover per member. © 2018 Mateos-Ronco and Guzmán-Asunción.},

	abstract = {The Chinese government faces a great challenge to safeguard the safety of the food supply chain due to the significant fragmentation of producers and weak institutional resources to monitor and enforce safety standards. Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called “One Farm Household, Two Production Systems” (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years. This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for famers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow “Green Food” are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides. © 2017},

We do not aim to provide definitive solutions by exhausting all conceptual analyses and accounting alternatives involving the reclassification of member shares, or “quotas”, from net equity to liabilities, but rather to present some considerations with regards to points that are not explicit in ICPC 14. Applying the concept of adjustment to present value (APV) is the main point of this study, which was not taken into account when ICPC 14 was elaborated. Analysis of the statutes of cooperatives indicates, as a common characteristic, the obligation to always pay the redemption of members' quotas in a period of more than one year, and this leads us to conclude that for a reliable representation of the phenomenon it is necessary to recognize the APV of this reclassified liability. © 2017 FEA.

Farm-level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures. © 2017 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The concept ‘governing through the community’ has been used frequently to interpret the neoliberal policy embraced by Australian governments since the 1990s. Yet explanation is still inadequate of how ‘governing through the community’ is conducted in practice, particularly the specific mechanisms that regulate interaction among government agencies, groups seeking to represent the community and individuals in the community. In this study, we find that ‘governing through the community’ is actually ‘governing through representatives of the community’ because it is the representatives that make the community visible and governable. This observation is based on a case study of three kinds of farmer organizations, in two states of Australia, who see their role as serving the community and are regarded by outsiders as representatives of the community at least on certain issues. An understanding of the interaction among different stakeholders within and outside of the community is developed through three themes of ‘paperwork’, ‘data’ and ‘price’ that were used by locals from Landcare groups, grower groups and farmer cooperatives, respectively, to articulate how they experience the mechanisms through which their interactions are regulated. This paper concludes that these groups can claim to represent some residents within a defined geographical area, rather than any exact definition of ‘the community’ and that this is a sufficient claim to enable these groups to participate in the process of ‘governing through the community’. The tensions between government agencies, community representatives and community members threaten the legitimacy of the community representatives as intermediaries. Government agencies do try to contribute to reduce these tensions by strengthening the legitimacy of community representatives through various policy and project mechanisms. However, while the stated aim of ‘governing through the community’ is often focused on producing a ‘flourishing rural community’ through improving democratic modes of representation, this study demonstrates that it is only part of the community, namely the ‘targeted customers’ of the farmer organizations, that is potentially reachable to ‘the state’. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Good corporate governance has been argued to be a key determinant of organizations performance. This study sought to determine the influence of corporate governance on the performance of financial institutions in Kenya. Using a structured questionnaire, data were obtained from 108 financial institutions comprising banks, insurance companies, Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOs) and Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs). Data was analyzed using regression analysis; the results indicate that corporate governance has a statistically significant influence on the performance of financial institutions. Board skills and board committees were found to be important predictors of the firms' performance. However, whereas board skills had a positive influence, board committees were found to have a negative influence on performance. Consequently, implications to theory, policy and managerial practice especially on board member's appointment and attributes to be considered. The study concludes that possession of requisite skills is one of the most important considerations in the appointment of board members. © 2018, Allied Academies.},

A total of 30 ornamental fish producers out of 90 were taken as sample for the study and data was collected through semi-structured Interview schedule. Constraints faced by them were classified as production constraints, knowledge constraints, marketing constraints and financial constraints. It was found that less water supply, less availability of live food and unsubsidized electricity supply were the main constraints. Low selling price of fish and large number of middlemen were hindering factors in marketing of ornamental fish. Also, lack of special trainings, non-Availability of crop insurance schemes and less credit facility were other major constraints faced by ornamental fish producers. Constraints faced by them need to be effectively addressed by Government and policy makers. Continuous supply of water, availability of live food and supply of electricity at a rate par with agriculture sector Is needed. Marketing of fish by forming marketing cooperative societies and innovative ways like mobile apps should be explored. Organization of special trainings in the field of breeding technology, live food development and health management are needed. State Government can pursue crop insurance schemes and banks / other financial institutions on offer credits. © 2017 Ecological Society of India. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in developing countries face a competitive disadvantage in modern agricultural supply chains. Joint marketing through cooperatives is a potential tool to mitigate these disadvantages; yet cooperatives’ success in these settings is uneven at best. We develop an analytical model to study a farmer's choice of selling to a private trader who pays cash on delivery but may exercise market power or a cooperative that promises a price premium but delays payment and carries a concomitant risk of default. In the presence of impatient and risk-averse farmers, we show that these factors can severely limit smallholder patronage of a cooperative, despite a promised price premium. We then construct and parameterize a simulation model to fit a profile of heterogeneous farmers within a prototype developing-country village, and study the optimal decisions of farmers regarding marketing through a cooperative versus a private trader. Results suggest that modest improvements in either timeliness of payment or probability of default can induce a substantial increase in a cooperative's market share and economic viability. Extending the simulation analysis to a dynamic setting shows how implementing reasonable policies to improve a cooperative's payment timeliness and default probability can markedly improve its growth trajectory. © 2018 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

Although SACCOs form the majority of microfinance providers in many developing countries, the most recent literature on microfinance governance and performance has given little reference to the longstanding body of relevant cooperative literature. SACCO representation in microfinance datasets is biased. Drawing on so-far unexploited datasets of Ugandan SACCOs and savings groups, this paper empirically analyses policy debate regarding SACCO- and savings group regulation. The findings point to the relevance of practically implementing the principle of ‘cooperation between cooperatives’ to ensure effective governance at SACCO level. Moreover, the paper introduces two new measures, based on members' savings and shares, which could become useful tools to track the application of cooperative principles in developing countries, and hence improve evidence-based policy-making for SACCOs. © 2016 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC},

	abstract = {Purpose: Studies on the performance of agribusiness cooperatives in Brazil focus on economic and financial aspects. The purpose of this paper is to further delve into such studies by investigating which commonly measurable structural production factors (horizontal, vertical and lateral diversification; operating area; number of associates; and time in operation) have greater impacts on the financial performance of such cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve such a goal, a survey was conducted with a sampling pool divided by size (annual net revenues of US$ 50 million or higher), and the questionnaire was employed as a method of data collection. The sample was concentrated in the southern, south-eastern and mid-western regions of Brazil; classified by size; and deemed adequate after several adequacy tests. Findings: The results were analysed using Spearman’s correlation, which showed that there were no significant correlations between the structural production factors considered in this study and the economic-financial performance of agricultural cooperatives, which leads to questions about the effectiveness of employing diversification strategies with a conjoint approach. Nonetheless, it was possible to identify several relationships not mentioned in the original hypotheses that might be addressed further in future studies. Research limitations/implications: The data obtained should be interpreted with caution because heteroscedasticity was detected. Although the cause could not be clearly identified, the presence of heteroscedasticity could mean that smaller and similar cooperatives present similar variation in their diversification and production base strategies. Originality/value: This work sought to generate knowledge regarding operations management, which was achieved by demonstrating that production diversification in a dynamic and relevant economic sector, that is, agricultural cooperatives, is limited in terms of financial return when performed in an isolated mode. Hence, cooperatives’ production managers should take into account the totality of structural production factors during their planning activities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach – Primary data were solicited from the cooperatives and members of cooperatives for this study through questionnaire administration. The questionnaire containing a five-point Likert scale was posed to respondents to ascertain their problems before and after joining the network (for cooperative) and after joining the cooperative (for members). This study employed the independent two-sample student t-test (two-tailed) to test for significant difference in the means of scores regarding the problems of cooperatives before and after the cooperative network, and also to test for significant difference in the means of scores of the problems of members of the cooperatives before and after joining the cooperative. Findings – The study revealed that key production and marketing problems such as increased transaction costs and market uncertainties confronting the cooperative organizations have been diminished as a result of the networks. Key problems of the members of the cooperatives such as exploitation and opportunistic behavior of traders to whom they sell their products have been reduced as a result of joining the cooperatives. Research limitations/implications – This paper is not without caveat. The governance structures in relation to leadership, financial arrangements and bargaining power balance have not been analyzed in this study and these are avenues for further research.

	abstract = {Social mechanisms underpinning collaborative approaches to pest management are as important as the biological control of the pest. To facilitate the success of an area-wide management approach, social factors need to be understood and addressed. This study qualitatively analyses social, psychological and institutional barriers and facilitators for the widespread adoption of area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly, and attitudes towards the use of sterile insect technology. Interviews were conducted (N = 35) with fruit growers, industry representatives, agronomists, government representatives and community leaders from across the dominant horticultural regions of southeastern Australia. Transcripts were analysed and compared based on thematic organisations. Growers and stakeholders expressed high acceptance for area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly and the use of sterile insect technology. However, participants reported limited knowledge of both area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Factors found to facilitate acceptance were perceptions of increased market access, increased social awareness, operationalising community champions and value chain actors, as well as dissemination of credible scientific evidence. Trust in those individuals advocating area-wide management and sterile insect technology, and interpersonal trust between neighbours, was also seen as an important factor affecting adoption of area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Barriers to acceptance included perceptions of costs and ongoing funding needs, lack of knowledge, apathy towards control of Queensland fruit fly, compatibility of area-wide management and sterile insect technology with current practices and a lack of social cooperation amongst growers. The data show a need to increase growers’ awareness of costs and benefits associated with Queensland fruit fly control and an understanding of the direct and indirect consequences of their own on-farm behaviours with respect to control. This study is the first to use a psychological lens to explore and distil grower and stakeholder attitudes towards a cooperative management approach for a pest of national significance. Results provide insight into beliefs that guide underlying biosecurity decision-making and can help improve uptake of other area-wide control techniques. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

Meanwhile, on the margins, agro-ecologically oriented tours bring admiring US students, farmers and agrarian advocates. Cubans concur that the country must solve key problems in its agricultural sector to overcome the contradictions of its agri-food model, and that this entails more exchange with the US – but in what capacity and on what terms? The current crossroads begs the classic agrarian question, even as it updates it. Having experienced and survived the promises and disasters of both capitalist and communist agricultural economies, Cuban farmers expand the original ‘peasant’ protagonist. As they navigate new non-state markets and recent re-entrenchment of state control of prices, Cuban farmers and cooperatives struggle to avoid monopolizing tendencies of unfettered capitalist as well as communist agricultural economies – both of which have historically been ecologically damaging. US agribusiness courts Cuba, but not as mere unidirectional capture: Cubans are inviting and leveraging trade to end the embargo, which is increasingly being modified altogether. Key Cuban agrarian principles of resilience and cooperativismo have persisted through capitalist and communist crises: could they influence prospects for agro-industrial hegemony from the North?. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Key findings suggest that indicators of financial cooperative development are positively correlated with the existence of a specialized regulation; supervision under non-bank financial supervisory authorities; and the presence of deposit insurance schemes, while general cooperative society’s regulations and banking regulations are negatively correlated with financial cooperatives’ indicators.

I find that the capital ratio, liquidity ratio, and delinquencies-to-total loans and leases decrease with an increase in the percentage of deposits that exceed the $250,000 per depositor regulatory threshold of standard deposit insurance. The influence of uninsured depositors is generally more significant for small credit unions than large credit unions. The results for the precrisis period are not consistent with those of the postcrisis period. However, the results are consistent across the six-year period following the financial crisis. Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that uninsured depositors are value-maximizing stakeholders who exercise control over the firm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate proprietary data from customers of a Southern Louisiana credit union. It analyzes the factors that contribute to an accelerated failure time (AFT) using information from customers’ credit applications as well as information provided in their credit report. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigates the factors that affect credit risk using survival analysis by employing two primary models – the AFT model and the Cox proportional hazard (PH) model. While several studies employ the Cox PH model, few use the AFT model. However, this paper concludes that the AFT model has superior predictive qualities. Findings: This paper finds that the factors specific to borrowers and local factors play an important role in the duration of a loan. Practical implications: This paper offers an easily interpretable model for determining the duration of a potential borrower. The marketing department of credit unions can then use this information to predict when a customer will default, thus allowing the credit union to intervene in a timely manner to prevent defaults. Further, the credit union can use this information to seek out customers who are less likely to default. Originality/value: This study is different from the previous research due to its focus on credit unions, which have distinct characteristics. Compared to similar lending institutions, the charter of the credit union does not allow management to sell off loans to other investors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically test the dairy production barriers: lack of cooperation between the chain actors, milk quality deficiencies, rural exodus and, productivity limitations in southern Brazil, based on Santa Catarina’s dairy production ecosystem players perceptions. Design/methodology/approach: From inquiry result analysis with 305 dairy sector experts, the authors performed statistical tests using the technique of factorial analysis and confirmatory factorial analysis to confirm and/or refute the dairy production barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). Findings: The results confirmed the presence of the barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The barrier lack of cooperation between the chain actors is presented as the biggest obstacle in the sector, according to the interviewees. The authors also found that rural exodus is the barrier with the smallest impact on the dairy sector development in relation to other barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The confirmation of these barriers in practice allows developing new studies to eliminate and/or mitigate these barriers of the dairy sector. Furthermore, the study might shed some light on dairy production activities and help improve management skills. Research limitations/implications: This study does not cover all the players that make up the dairy production ecosystem. It is limited only to the main players that are inserted in this sector. The authors observed the lack of data characterizing the dairy production system in Santa Catarina. Originality/value: This study presents theoretical and practical contribution. By the confirmation that these barriers are present in the field, it is possible to direct new studies that seek to mitigate them and results in dairy production improvements. As for the practical contribution, the confirmation of those barriers can serve as a basis for the dairy sector decision-making actors, such as government, research institutions, and extension, producers, cooperatives, among others, and assist them in developing strategic actions that concern a cooperative way to develop the whole sector. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Such incentives derived from marketing cooperatives include indirect benefits such as reduction in transaction costs arising from participation in imperfect factor and product markets. However, whether marketing through cooperatives also creates direct economic benefits as additional incentives by securing competitive producer prices is not empirically established in the relevant development literature to augment related policy debates and to rationalize investments on such institutions. Using a farm economic model on producer price data taken from Ethiopian smallholders who produce sesame as a traditional cash crop, this paper empirically tested the power and influence of the cooperative institution on the level of producer prices received by farmers. The results show the instrumental role of marketing cooperatives in terms of securing competitive producer prices to farmers. The evidence provides empirical support to justify the desirability of revitalizing institutional marketing schemes as appropriate mechanisms to improve the economic incentives of smallholders for better market participation and commercialization towards poverty reduction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The key engine for this marketing experiment is the Sahaja Aharam Producer Company Limited (SAPCO), a producer organisation. SAPCO has tried to create new supply chains that guarantee that the produce it sells complies with the quality standards needed to certify the foods as ‘organic’. SAPCO is an initiative of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) which has taken up the bulk of the financial and administrative burden of managing the company. The revival of traditional knowledge for organic farming and the marketing of organic produce has invariably required the intervention of external agents such as CSA. In the final section, we assess the achievements of SAPCO from the viewpoint of the small farmers who belong to the producer co-operatives that make up SAPCO’s membership. Our key research question is whether it has been possible to scale up the production and marketing of small farmers’ output and create a new supply chain independent of local intermediaries. © 2017 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.},

Design/methodology/approach: Two-stage least squares panel regression approach is utilized to analyse data covering 1,272 firm-year observations for 212 SACCOs over a six-year period, 2008-2013. An analysis of the pre- and post-regulation impacts on compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements is also performed. Findings: The results, which are in support of the institutional theory, reveal that licensed SACCOs engage in higher compliance with mandatory disclosures, and this improves from the pre- to the post-regulation period. The results show that SACCOs under inquiry engage in lower compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements, especially in the post-regulation period. The findings also reveal a significant and positive association between SACCO size, co-operative governance and compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on transition-level SACCOs in a single country. An extension into other jurisdictions with nascent, transitional and mature SACCOs would provide greater insights into the impact of disclosure regulation. Further, the study uses a self-constructed disclosure checklist which is subject to coding errors and biases. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for SACCO regulators and accounting professional body to devise incentives to improve the level of compliance with required disclosures. Originality/value: The study contributes to the dearth of evidence on the efficacy of the introduction of mandatory disclosure requirements in a developing country where compliance is problematic because of difficulties with enforcement. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In Indian context, to empower women and enable political participation, 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) was introduced. Subsequently, many women entered politics. Though widespread proxy is reported, still a small proportion engages effectively in governmental participation (Hust, 2002; Mathew, 2003; Palanithurai, 2001). Studies also find female Dalit-headed panchayats are more active (Jayshree, 2010; Kalaiselvi, 2012). As the cultural norms, traditions and patriarchy are rigid, the paper attempts to examine what helps the women to be functional? Does social networks differ? Is there a link between social capital, by way of associationalism, and capacity for self governance as suggested by Putnam (1993) in the Indian context? Social capital is understood through social networks and membership in associations. Thirty-eight elected representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions of southern Tamil Nadu, south India was interviewed in depth. Active members prominently belong to Dalit community and the social network of the elected active members is larger in size, heterogeneous in terms of age, gender and caste composition, and they are anchors themselves. They are primarily embedded in a web of political, caste and self-help group associations and have access to all women police stations, cooperative societies and political parties through family ties. The elected representative’s mandatory membership in district Dalit federations provides safety-net in dealing with discrimination and atrocities while also intervening at the village-level panchayat.

It also identifies the following roles of the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JAs) and the specialist wholesaler as innovation intermediaries to: (1) develop new farming materials such as fertilizers, (2) translate and deliver practical farming knowledge for farmers and (3) establish the market of environmental-friendly rice. Statistical analysis uncovers that farmers more appreciated the supports from the JAs than those from other intermediaries to participate in the schemes. Complemented by the innovation journey analysis, our findings suggest that the keys to increasing farmers’ participation in the schemes include a clear vision and economic incentives for farmers as well as the coordination among intermediaries who have different expertise. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Drawing on qualitative research on two Mondragon multinational co-ops based on longitudinal data and in-depth interviews, we address the dilemmas raised by the multinationalization of co-ops through the establishment of subsidiaries abroad, and show the tensions surrounding the ‘cooperativization’ of foreign subsidiaries, that is to say, the reproduction of the cooperative organizational formula and the transfer of its idiosyncratic policies and practices to foreign subsidiaries. The main finding of the research is that, behind the instrumentalization of various institutional barriers by the managerial technostructure of the parent co-ops to justify the non-cooperativization of foreign subsidiaries, lie factors stemming from headquarters-subsidiary power relations, as well as from core co-op owner-members looking to protect their own interests. Indeed, a clear dissociation has been found between the Mondragon corporate discourse about the promotion of participation and democracy overseas, and the real practices that are operational within the foreign subsidiaries. The article also draws some practical implications for multinational co-ops wishing to extend the cooperative model to their overseas subsidiaries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The small size of Israel has allowed young families to inhabit the countryside while working in nearby cities. Such rural urbanization has not happened in Israel’s periphery, such as the Eshkol region (western Negev), where bad public transportation makes it harder to commute to Beer Sheva or Tel Aviv. Nowadays, low birth rate, ageing population and progressive depopulation characterize the Eshkol region.

The findings provide a decision base for policy-makers to improve the technology base and to ease the reliance on technology imports.

Previous research showed that technology transfer into Russian agricultural enterprises suffers from a low knowledge level especially in receiving organizations.

This article frames the trajectory of Japan's agricultural support and protection regime as a process of gradual endogenous institutional change. The pace and direction of this process are not only determined on the macro level, but also in the 'local'. To illustrate this argument, the article traces the local origins of recent policies toward farmland consolidation surrounding a major revision of the Agricultural Land Law in 2009. This revision deregulated corporate farmland access, but also prepared the ground for a new approach to public farmland allocation to expanding farms. The latter was sourced from certain local farmland governance models. At a closer look, these local models are not only 'best practices' to achieve farmland consolidation, but also reflect the 'defensive' interests of the incumbent local stakeholders of the postwar agricultural support and protection regime, such as the local branches of JA, the powerful organization of agricultural cooperatives. More generally, the article proposes to understand localnational policy transfers as a mode of endogenous institutional change. © The Author 2017.

We interviewed administrators at twenty Costa Rican coffee cooperatives about management practices related to voluntary certification. Voluntary certifications are popular among coffee cooperatives. Access to certified markets is facilitated by state support of the cooperative sector, regulation of the coffee sector and well-enforced environmental and social laws. However, there are no significant or consistent financial incentives for farmers to pursue certification. Multiple certifications may lower auditing and implementation costs, but cooperatives rarely receive the full premium for multiply-certified coffee. Low market demand for certified coffee, weak price incentives and high auditing and management costs encourage cooperatives to certify only a portion of their members. This strategy rewards compliant farmers rather than inducing widespread change to farming practices among the entire membership. Though financial incentives are weak, certifications offer non-financial benefits to both farmers and cooperatives, including better management and more resilient cooperatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

One major decision taken by the European Commission was to transition the powers of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors to that of the European Banking Authority (EBA). Our analysis focuses primarily on the differing behaviour by each European country's banking sector to major shocks, namely that in the form of bank closures. It is then necessary to investigate and further understand the role that the European Banking Authority now possesses with regards to releasing sensitive announcements based on the underlying currents of the European Banking system as measured by domestic banking sector stock returns. Finally, we investigate the cultural characteristics that can be uncovered by analysing the responses of domestic banking sectors to uniform regulation. We present three key findings. First, European countries with more local banking networks in the form of credit unions, public banks or savings banks, generate greater levels of volatility when compared to that of their commercial counterparts, particularly in countries with more monopolistic sectors. Secondly, the announcements of the European Banking Authority generate significant volatility effects for the European banking sector at large, with particular emphasis on stress testing results, but also announcements based on recapitalisation, regulation and transparency. Finally, cultural distance effects are identified, indicating that peripheral states are experiencing more substantial volatility effects to European Banking Authority decisions. These results indicate that uniformity of regulation may in fact be hindering and restricting the growth of some domestic and more peripheral and locally designed banking sectors in the form of rules designed for commercial banking operations. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite the fact that extension practitioners face many problems in this area of their work, there is currently a lack of academic literature that systematically addresses the topic and offers concrete guidelines for practice. Thus, this paper will aim to clarify the benefits of farmers' groups, associations and networks within the context of family farming, systematise problems faced by rural extensionists when working with farmers' groups and associations, provide conceptual tools for understanding group and associative processes, and construct a set of guidelines and recommendations for facing said problems. In order to achieve these aims, the authors conducted an extensive literature review and drew upon their personal experience on the topic. Results suggest that some of the benefits of associative work are: better access to inputs, produce and credit markets, the facilitation of learning processes, the empowerment of family farmers as social actors, and a reduction of rural extension costs. Additionally, with respects to the problems faced by extensionists, the following can be highlighted: individualist attitudes and conflicts between farmers, scarce participation and commitment, problems with leaderships and with organisations' administrative management, and the lack of extensionists' training to address these processes, among others. With regards to the factors that increase trust and cooperation are: interpersonal communication and mutual knowledge, sharing problems, values and objectives, and the existence of shared rules for the functioning of the group that include sanctions for transgressors. In this context, the extensionists' role will be that of facilitating processes of construction of group relationships, creating rules for the groups' functioning and developing the group's capacities for self-management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In response to challenges faced by new entrants to agriculture in accessing farmland oriented towards localized and alternative food systems, advocates for farmland protection and cooperative land access point to the potential for community-based land reform to support sustainable land use while promoting social and political equity – areas where they argue an economic system based on individual ownership of farmland has failed. Based on the principles of “new agrarianism,” community-based farmland access initiatives are experimenting with new forms and practices of cooperative and shared land tenure, as an alternative to a state-led model of redistributive land reform based on individual property rights. We analyze here the results of a participatory research project conducted with a cooperative and community-based land trust and land access program in British Columbia, Canada. We assess the efficacy of the community farms program as a potential mechanism to spark a new phase of agrarian transition that can reverse farmland consolidation and support socially and ecologically embedded land relations, as a structural context for food sovereignty in North America. Specifically, we argue that the community foodlands trust movement can be viewed an insurgent – but fundamentally constrained – “people's enclosure” within a corporate land regime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Concessional bargaining in day-to-day interactions generates goodwill, which helps smoothen future dealings amongst farmers as well as with outside agents. In particular, we model the existence of goodwill amongst farmers as enhancing their ability to collectively bargain with an outside dealer that buys their farm produce. Results suggest that when dealing with each other, farmers offer higher concessions when the risk of loss or reversal in bargaining power is high; however, the level of concession is also influenced by the degree of reciprocity and parameters that affect bargaining surplus. Findings provide further insights over the success of cooperative institutions in rural farm settings where inter-farmer goodwill dynamics determines the cooperative's bargaining outcomes. Specifically, when farmers generously reciprocate each other's goodwill gestures, it leads to better outcomes through increasing their cooperative reservation price. In contrast, when the degree of reciprocity is lower, or when the risk of bargaining power switching is higher, farmers extract more surplus from other farmers, and this also lowers the cooperative's bargaining outcomes and makes the cooperative arrangement unviable in the long term. © 2017 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2017 CIRIEC},

	abstract = {There is growing concern that Agri-environment Schemes (AESs) may not be effective in conserving the countryside. Particular concern has arisen around whether the current approach of individual, farm-level, AES agreements are sufficient to offer landscape-scale environmental protection and enhancement. Whilst recent additions to AESs have sought to encourage more joined-up thinking by offering payments to farmers to form collective agreements, uptake is low and there is very little known about farmers’ (non)resistance to such collective conservation. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research with 74 farms across 5 sites in the UK, this paper provides new data on the barriers to farmers’ uptake of collective AESs and offers a new formulation of how we understand farming cooperation. The paper advances Bourdieusian-inspired ideas of the cultural construct of ‘good farming’ by synthesising these with recent reconceptualizations of ‘trust’ in order to provide a more contextually grounded and temporally-inflected understanding of farmers’ cooperative activities. The findings reveal that whilst working relations between farmers are often collegiate, and in places collective, several watershed events over past decades have led to a shift from community-level to process-based (peer-to-peer) trust and a move toward land management being depicted as a squarely individual rather than collective issue. Conceptually, the paper moves beyond the current limitation of viewing trust, and the associated development of social capital – seen as a prerequisite for more collective AESs – as cumulative and one-directional to highlighting their multiple, issue-specific, nature which may become eroded and (re)developed over time. Alongside this, the paper offers a new way of understanding the good farmer by shifting the focus from the individual farm/farmer level to a more fine-grained and contextualised issue-centered notion of good farming. This is then used to explain the seeming reluctance of land holders, evidenced in official statistics, to engage in collective AESs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {After the abolition of milk quotas in Switzerland, dairy farmers had to reorganise. New farmers' organisations emerged and traditional co-operatives had to search for strategies at multiple levels (markets, membership, services provision, and diversification) to strengthen their position. In this ethnographic study, we analyse three central co-operative values – democracy, solidarity, autonomy – and their translation and development within the adaptation strategies developed by five farmers' organisations. Despite the many challenges to co-operative values related to a context of market deregulation, the new strategies developed demonstrate the continued importance and rejuvenation of these co-operative values as narratives and practices. In addition, results show a blurring of boundaries between organisations of different kinds (specifically co-operatives and public limited companies) and overlaps in the strategies employed by both (including new forms of collaboration and marketing). Whilst these emerging forms, and the associated strategies and values embodied, could be read as the hybridization of a traditional co-operative approach, we argue that the concept of hybridity unduly polarises co-operatives and corporates in a way that does not acknowledge the implicit plurality of motivations and behaviours in all forms of business structure. Consequently, the paper argues that looking at the practices of co-operation, beyond rigid categories, helps to understand better how co-operative values are actually enacted within farmers' organisations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The supervision and audit of agricultural cooperatives in Greece are neither defined nor used with a clear content in the Greek legal texts. Nevertheless, it has been argued that supervision is mainly associated with broad monitoring duties, including advice and guidance, whereas audit is usually limited to a financial and legal control of the enterprise. The aforementioned institutions have not been adequately prescribed by law and effectively applied in practice, in order to address the cooperatives’ needs and protect the members’, the minority’s and the public interest. The recent legal reforms, since the outbreak of the crisis, brought to the fore the topic of cooperative supervision and audit. Thus, a question is posed of whether they have been a positive step forward. The present article, therefore, aiming to analyze relevant past and recent laws, concluded that despite minor innovations the shortcoming of the above institutions are yet to be resolved. Thus, a politically independent supervisory authority, a cooperative-oriented audit examining the cooperative’s impact to its members, the environment and the local community, as well as the formation of a scientific committee to monitor the cooperative laws’ implementation are suggested as necessary changes for the improvement of the existing regime. © 2018, European Business Law Review.

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is one of the serious international environmental issues that can lead to severe damages such as climate change, sea level rise, emerging disease and many other impacts. Rice cultivation is associated with emissions of potent GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide. Thai rice has been massively exported worldwide however the markets are becoming more competitive than ever since the green market has been hugely promoted. In order to maintain the same level or enhance of competitiveness, Thai rice needs to be considered for environmentally conscious products to meet the international environmental standards. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of rice production in order to identify the major emission sources and possible reduction strategies. In this research, the rice variety considered is Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105) cultivated by organic practices. The data sources were Don-Chiang Organic Agricultural Cooperative (DCOAC), Mae-teang district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand and the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) of Thailand with onsite records and interviews of farmers in 2013. The GHG emissions were calculated from cradle-to-farm by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and the 2006 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The functional unit is defined as 1 kg of paddy rice at farm gate. Results showed that the total GHG emissions of organic rice production were 0.58 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice. The major source of GHG emission was from the field emissions accounting for 0.48 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice, about 83% of total, followed by land preparation, harvesting and other stages (planting, cultivation and transport of raw materials) were 9, 5 and 3% of total, respectively. The comparative results clearly showed that the GHG emissions of organic paddy rice were considerably lower than conventional rice production due to the advantages of using organic fertilisers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is increasing need for knowledge on the utility of information and communication technology (ICT) for improved agricultural productivity and enhanced income in smallholder production enterprises. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using cellphone technology as a training tool on smallholder dairy farms (SDFs) in Kenya. This field trial was carried out between June and September 2017 on 40 farms randomly selected from members of the Naari Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society in Naari sub-location of Meru County, Kenya. An abridged dairy management handbook, developed by Farmers Helping Farmers and the University of Prince Edward Island, was translated into the local dialect, and disseminated as short message text. After pre-intervention knowledge and attitudes assessments on dairy management, farms were randomly allocated into intervention and comparison groups. Using an online short message service interface (because the study population all had cell phones but only 1.7% had smart phones), short messages on management practices were sent daily, for 3 months, to the phones owned by the farmers in the intervention group. Post-intervention assessment of dairy management knowledge and attitudes related to the messages was done 3 weeks post-intervention. Within and between group comparisons and net changes were determined using t-tests, Chi-squared tests where applicable. There were no significant demographic or knowledge differences between the two groups pre-intervention. Compared to pre-intervention, trained farmers in the intervention group were significantly more informed on: mastitis prevention, disease (calf diarrhea) prevention, stall management, the role of a balanced nutritious diet on immunity and the resolution of some health conditions post-intervention. Translation of message content to the local language and using easily understandable terminology were reported to be helpful for better understanding and motivation of farmers to implement recommendations. Cellphone technology with a short message service interface can be an effective training tool for SDFs in remote areas of Kenya located far from where seminars are conducted for dairy farmers. © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

Adherence to these standards was required under a federal marketing order that applied to essentially all tomatoes grown in Florida. The California Tomato Farmers cooperative, whose members produced the vast majority of fresh tomatoes grown in California, also required that its members adopt these standards. The collective food-safety standards for fresh tomatoes closely resemble the requirements of the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule, so the collective adoption of these standards provides an excellent case study to illustrate the possible effects of FSMA implementation on demand. I assess the hypothesis that demand for tomatoes from Florida and California increased following the adoption of standards for food-safety practices by growers in those states, relative to demand for tomatoes from other regions. My analysis demonstrates essentially no evidence that demand for fresh tomatoes responded positively to the implementation of collective food-safety practices. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

	abstract = {Significant scale economies have been recently cited to rationalize a dramatic growth in the US retail credit union sector over the past few decades. In this paper, we explore another plausible supply-side explanation for the growth of the industry, namely economies of diversification. We focus on the fact that credit unions differ among themselves in the range of financial services they offer to their members. Since larger credit unions tend to offer a more diversified financial service menu than credit unions of a smaller size, the incentive to grow in size may be fueled not only by present scale economies but also by economies of diversification. This paper provides the first robust estimates of such economies of diversification for the credit union sector. We estimate a flexible semiparametric smooth coefficient quantile panel data model with correlated effects that is capable of accommodating a four-way heterogeneity among credit unions. Our results indicate the presence of non-negligible economies of diversification in the industry. We find that as many as 27–91% (depending on the type and the cost quantile) of diversified credit unions enjoy substantial economies of diversification; the cost of most remaining credit unions is invariant to the scope of services. We also find overwhelming evidence of increasing returns to scale in the industry. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This study examines Shari’ah governance (SG) arrangements within the cooperatives in Malaysia. The objectives of this paper are to explore the application of SG in the cooperative sector in Malaysia and to evaluate the adequacy of SG adoption in cooperative. This study uses qualitative methods where the data are collected using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with regulators, experts, and the governance organs of the cooperatives. The study focuses on credit cooperatives that have been listed in the 100 Best Cooperative Directory issued by Suruhanjaya Koperasi Malaysia (SKM) annually from 2012 to 2016. The findings from thematic analysis on interviews conducted indicate that the first objective, most respondents agreed that cooperatives should be operated based on the objectives of its establishment. The findings on the adequacy of adoption of SG in Shari’ah-compliant cooperatives indicate that the practice is at an infancy stage, with plenty of support and motivation are needed to ensure effective and efficient implementation of SG. Emergent findings from the interviews reveal that the Islamic attributes are crucial for a cooperative’s SG organs such as Islamic accountability, Shari’ah mindset, Islamic culture, awareness and readiness, manpower competencies and cooperation (ta'awun). It is vital for the SG organs to have such attributes in order to foster awareness among them to be more responsible and willing to adopt good SG practices.

Value co-creation, professionalization of management, satisfaction and loyalty, and long-term time orientation of the member were measured based on the member’s perception. The results demonstrate a significant association between satisfaction and loyalty and perception of value co-creation and a positive association between the long-term time horizon and the perception of value co-creation actions. In other words, perception of the benefits generated by the actions of the cooperative can be influenced by time orientation and level of satisfaction and loyalty.

For the development of agricultural cooperation system have been developed possible options for combining agricultural commodity producers, a mechanism for the formation and functioning of perspective models of agricultural cooperatives in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The recommended model for the creation of a cooperative for the livestock fattening and slaughtering in the practical activities of livestock farms will contribute to stabilization of the economy of sector, including an increase in amount of livestock, the production of meat and milk. The model for the creation the cooperative on chicken cultivation and production of poultry meat is one of the most urgent and promising directions for the development of agrarian and industrial complex. In this regard, it is recommended to create the cooperative by combining the population farms with the aim of building an incubator, a mini feed mill, a slaughterhouse, chicken growing house and further selling poultry to the trade network. In order to improve the breeding value and composition of the main herd for producing sheep products and wool oriented for the export and further distributing them recommended model of cooperative on sheep breeding and wool production. The necessity of creating a cooperative oriented for the primary processing of agricultural products by installing a milk receiving point of milk, which gives a significant economic effect to the country's agriculture, is substantiated. With the aim of increasing the effectiveness of the process of cooperating small forms of management and the stable functioning of the established agricultural cooperatives, the necessity of elaborating a Concept for the Development of Agricultural Cooperatives in the Republic of Kazakhstan is justified; also formulated purpose, main tasks, expected results and the mechanism for its implementation. © 2018.},

Tighter vertical ties are developing to comply with these stringent quality requirements. In addition, the issue of limited bargaining power for smallholders in these coordinated chains has prompted a renewed interest in cooperative organizations. In Ethiopia, a partnership between a domestic trading firm and a cooperative union has helped enhancing capabilities at the supply-base as well as strengthening the cooperative's internal governance, managerial capabilities, and financial and non-financial resources. Based on in-depth interviews, our paper presents a case study on how this partnership operates. Good technical assistance provided by the union, with support from the exporting company and an NGO, is one of the key success factors of this partnership. The study also highlights that a high price is not necessarily a driver for a successful partnership, as predetermined prices are preferred by farmers despite relatively higher prices on the local market. © 2017},

Cooperatives are an alternative to supply a credit demand in the market, because a third of the municipalities have no bank branches. Although the participation of cooperatives in credit operations is still small compared to the Brazilian national banking system, its continued growth demonstrates the importance of this sector. In this sense, the analysis of the performance of these cooperatives becomes relevant to the extent that incentives to industry expansion differ from other financial institutions. In this context, this study aimed to analyze which the financial and economic performance of Brazil's largest credit unions. This performance analysis was performed using the indicators proposed by the CAMEL model, then the data envelopment analysis (DEA). It can be seen that there is a positive relationship between the use of variables in the model and the measurement of financial performance of credit unions.

We analyze the importance of the Basel III additional capital buffer requirements for credit union prudential regulation. Based on a sample of the 100 largest credit unions in Canada from 1996 to 2014, we find that Canadian credit union capital buffers behave countercyclically over the business cycle. Further, credit unions hold a capital buffer bigger than the maximum buffer advocated under Basel III which is 5% of risk-weighted assets (RWA). These results suggest that, unlike commercial banks worldwide, credit unions, by and large, are already in compliance with the new Basel III buffer requirements. However, there is evidence that the capital buffers of low-capitalized credit unions are procyclical. These credit unions increased their RWA during booms but failed to build up additional capital accordingly. Hence, weakly capitalized credit unions are more likely to adjust their capital buffers if they are subject to Basel III capital buffer regulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

It analyzes the relationship between vertical and horizontal structures, and the economic sustainability of different structure combinations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a conceptual framework to predict coordination structures as a function of transaction-cost characteristics, compares predictions for the Malian cereals market to empirical evidence using 15 case studies, and then analyzes structure combinations. Findings: Asymmetric scale between farmers and buyers; uncertainty in production, prices, policy, and contract enforcement; and quality and quantity debasement lead to selections of structures with high levels of control. Vertical and horizontal structures demonstrate a complementary relationship in certain core coordination roles, while exhibiting substitutability in the provision of other coordination activities. The marketing cooperative and marketing contract pairing is the most prevalent combination. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual framework is useful for explaining the selection of coordination structures, and can be applied in other contexts to strengthen external validity. Originality/value: The framework facilitates predictions and explanation of both VC and HC structures, with empirical application on a country and value chains receiving little attention in the literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

After the collapse of many weakly performing monopolist organizations during the 1980s and 1990s, strengthened cooperatives have emerged since the 2000s. Scholarly knowledge about the state–cooperative relations in which this “revival” takes place remains poor. Based on new evidence from Uganda's coffee sector, this paper discusses the political economy of Africa's cooperative revival. The authors argue that donors' and African governments' renewed support is framed in largely apolitical terms, which obscures the contested political and economic nature of the revival. In the context of neoliberal restructuring processes, state and non-state institutional support to democratic economic organizations with substantial redistributional agendas remains insufficient. The political–economic context in Uganda—and potentially elsewhere in Africa—contributes to poor terms of trade for agricultural cooperatives while maintaining significant state control over some cooperative activities to protect the status quo interests of big capital and state elites. These conditions are unlikely to produce a conflict-free, substantial, and sustained revival of cooperatives, which the new promoters of cooperatives suggest is under way. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

The highest benefit cost ratio was achieved by the large farms because of judicious expenditure in cashew production and obtaining a sizeable amount of returns. In the West Garo Hills, cashew value chain needs application of modern technology and proper management practices for better production and marketing. The study highlight that the prospect of cashew value chain in Meghalaya is bright as the trend of other traditional crop production in the potential areas is quite encouraging for the organic cashew farming. There is enough scope for enhancing organic produce of cashew. Direct marketing of cashew produce always fetch good price for the producer but it is not possible for all categories of farmers.

	abstract = {Many authors have proposed cooperatives as one of the preferred governance structures for realising alternative food systems, being recommended both in farming and also downstream at consumer level. However, recommendations for the cooperative model still draw dividing line between producer and consumer cooperatives. As opposed to conventional agricultural cooperatives (ACs) made up of farmer members only, the multi-stakeholder model brings together producers, consumers and/or restaurateurs under one single enterprise. This paper analyses multi-stakeholder cooperatives' (MSCs) potential to recreate more sustainable food flows between rural and urban areas and to overcome the limitations of conventional farmer cooperatives focused more on economic than social and environmental benefits. As part of this research, historical data from cooperative archives is used to look at the history and early attempts of multi-stakeholder cooperation in food and farming. Additionally, current supporting evidence from Spain and UK, in the context of European food policy frameworks, is also presented. A four-fold proposal for open cooperatives is discussed and applied to the analysis of the case studies in the framework of global transformative networks and alliances. The introduction of different types of members seems to both complicate and enrich the cooperative mission, both theoretically and in practice. Their networks with other social movements reveal how the MSCs presented are trying to change, rather than adapt to the market economies they struggle to survive in. The findings suggest MSCs in food and farming are striving to achieve more-than-economic benefits and are moving into the arena of the open and pro-commons economy and other global social movements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

While the marketplace is dominated by large corporations such as General Mills and Kraft Heinz, there exist few farmer cooperatives with well-known brands, which may imply its long-term viability is jeopardized. Therefore, this study analyzes trademark data of U.S. farmer cooperatives to better determine (i) which types of farmer cooperatives brand and (ii) how much farmer cooperatives brand relative to firms. Per the first negative binomial model, trademark ownership intensity is relatively high for marketing cooperatives in dairy, fruits and vegetables, nuts, and several other raw commodities. However, the second model indicates farmer cooperatives own 1086% fewer trademarks as compared to firms in the same sectors. U.S. farmer cooperatives thus have relatively weak brand equity. To spur future competitiveness by means of branding, farmer cooperatives may improve product quality, adapt ownership structure characteristics to facilitate member investment in long-term growth opportunities, use strategic arrangements to assign control of non-member business to decision specialists, form common agencies with other farmer cooperatives, or use family-based or origin-based connotations to raise consumer willingness-to-pay. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The paper uses the Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm to identify how quality management systems have resulted in the financial performance of the Greek agricultural cooperatives before the economic crisis. This is an alternative approach to the research related to these systems impact on companies’ financial performance and the first attempt to investigate if the Greek agricultural cooperatives have benefited from the implementation of quality management systems as a broader strategic orientation that focuses on quality and diversification. Nevertheless, the estimation results cannot support that quality management systems have resulted in better financial results. On the contrary, their association proved to be negative.

	abstract = {Purpose – The aim of this study was to verify whether the credit unions affiliated to Brazilian Confederation of Central Cooperatives (UNICRED) manage their accounting results, in order to reduce the variability of the institution’s returns and transmit a sense of solidity to its members. Design/methodology/approach – The method adopted was the Classic Linear Regression Model with Panel Data, estimated by Feasible Generalized Least Squares for fixed effects and corrections for heteroscedasticity. The sample was made up of 113 credit unions affiliated to UNICRED systems, over the 2001-2011 period, and data was made available by Central Bank of Brazil. Findings – The analysis, carried out through non-discretionary results on credit operations in order to explain the changes in net expenses of provision on credit operations, indicated there was smoothing of results. Thus, we can infer that the credit unions affiliated to UNICRED make use of earnings management in the income smoothing modality. Originality/value – This study contributes to the issue of Accounting Results Management, and corroborates that there are indications that, in the occurrence of higher non-discretionary results, credit unions tend to maximize provisions. Similarly, in the occurrence of lower non-discretionary results, they tend to minimize provisions, making evident the search for smaller variability in results, thus signaling mitigation of risks. © FECAP.},

Ninety artisanal fishermen were selected using two-stage sampling techniques. Questionnaire and interview schedule was used to get information. The research objectives were analyzed using frequency, percentages and mean. On the socio-economics characteristics of the artisanal fishermen, it was found that the majority (58%) of the respondents were male with 36% of the respondents having secondary school as their highest level of education. Also 31% have fishing experience of below10 years with yearly fish output of above 1000kg by 31% of the respondents and yearly income of greater than N200,000 by 53% of the respondents while 81% belong to co-operative society. Extension agents have visited none of the respondents. The major environmental factors affecting artisanal fishing in the area were oil spillage (100%), waste disposal (100%) and climatic factors (100%). On the constraints faced, the study found out that militant activities, inadequate finance, oil spillage around depots, and poor sales were found to be serious. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that, the Government and other appropriate authorities should enforce the fishing laws and regulations to avoid illegal exploitation of fishing grounds by trawlers and the destruction of artisanal fishing gears. Also, better access to relevant information should be enhanced by making extension services available to fish farmers in the various depots. © 2018 Agricultural Extension Society of Nigeria.},

The perception of farmers was important to build relationships with nature during the implementation and management of agroforestry systems (AFS), however, more work needs to be done in order to better understand this perception. For this purpose, quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied, interviews with semi-structured scripts were carried out, crosscut walks in rural areas with direct observation and annotations were done in a field diary. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics in the SPSS 19.0 program. The farmers' perceptions about AFS are distinct. The environmental feature is considered by smallholders due to their historical-cultural view of systems management and the necessity for shadowing and valorization of ecosystem services. The commercial concerns are more relevant to agrobusiness farmers It is worth noting that, in view of the analysis, the support of CAMTA (Mixed Agricultural Cooperative of Tomé-Açu), APPRAFAMTA (Association of Rural Producers and Producers of Family Agriculture of Tomé-Açu) and educational and research institutions is important in the dissemination of information and the exchange of experiences for the agroecological transition.},

	abstract = {Research has often depicted consumer co-operatives as specifically socially responsible organizations that both can and should take CSR issues especially seriously. In this paper, we analyse the CSR activities of the regional co-operatives of the leading Finnish retailer S Group based on annual board reporting. In light of our findings, we argue that no consistently high level of CSR can be identified across the S Group and all its regional co-operatives. Therefore, we do not deem it feasible to conclude that consumer co-operatives are inherently socially responsible organizations merely due to their organization form. Instead, it seems that the fact that the members are in charge in a consumer co-operative and elect a board to oversee it serves to keep the responsibility in the hands of local residents, but at the same time, it also requires a genuine interest towards governance of the co-operative as well as CSR issues. In the absence of either, the level of responsibility is likely to depend on the interest management and board members show in these issues. The paper concludes with practical implications for the S Group and consumer co-operatives in general as well future avenues for research on CSR and consumer co-operatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Factors affecting the adoption of double cropping were explored in rice farms of Fouman County of Guilan Province in northern Iran using artificial neural networks (ANNs), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LGR). Eleven factors (age, education, occupation, family size, type of farm ownership, distance to the agricultural service center, attending agricultural extension courses, use of financial resources and bank loans, number of domestic animals, area under cultivation, and social participation) were examined. An additional objective was to compare the ability of the three models in predicting the adoption of double cropping. ANNs showed an overall predictive power of 89.8%. LDA showed an overall predictive power of 83.2%, with seven of the eleven independent variables being effective on the adoption of double cropping. LGR indicated an overall predictive power of 87.6%, with eight of the eleven independent variables being effective on the adoption of double-rice cropping. ANNs showed higher power than LGR and LDA in predicting the adoption of double cropping. Based on all three methods used for analysis, the most important independent variables were social participation and area under cultivation (positive factors) as well as distance to the agricultural service center and family members (negative factors). Establishment of cooperatives or other kinds of farmers’ associations to foster social participation could motivate adoption of double cropping, particularly among small-scale farmers. To increase agricultural services, more local centers should be created in rural areas. The government should promote double cropping through effective incentives and technology transfer to small-scale farmers. © 2017, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan KK.},

	abstract = {The expansion of global seafood trade creates opportunities as well as risks for small-scale fisheries (SSFs) livelihoods. Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucatán, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16 months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron–client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron–client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron–client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world's SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-à-vis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

However, it is the first to possess all three of these attributes simultaneously. For this reason, the Bristol Pound has been heralded by some as marking a new era for local currency-driven localisation. To explore the Bristol Pound's impact on localisation, 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with businesses and other Bristol Pound stakeholders. Economists were also interviewed to gain insights into the barriers to localisation and the likely impact of a CLC on these barriers. Overall, our findings suggest that the Bristol Pound is not driving localisation. Many of the key barriers were found to be political/institutional in nature (e.g. support for free trade, the free movement of capital, the power of global corporations, and the expansionary logic of capitalism). Such barriers are unlikely to be influenced by a CLC.

	abstract = {Under the so-called ‘de-involution’ of the young leaving and women and elderly left behind in the countryside, how can the Chinese rural sector accomplish a structural transition and achieve large-scale agricultural production? This is the issue to be discussed in this paper. The conventional understanding is that large-scale production is about land concentration and scale management through agricultural businesses, family farms, or agricultural cooperatives. In our view, given the unfavorable Chinese land/people ratio, any attempt to eliminate household-based, small-scale farming is bound to fail. This study suggests that a paradigm shift is needed from ‘Scale Management’ to ‘Scale Service.’ Today’s agricultural production is no longer a ‘Pole-like Straight Way’ model. Different stages and processes of production have their own unique characteristics and functions. With the advancement of agricultural technology and the marketization of production factors, agricultural service has needed to catch up in scale. However, this development does not have to be based on land concentration and the elimination of household farming. On the contrary, it can be done through local social networks. Local social networks can significantly reduce the organizational costs of large-scale services without changing the current household-based small farming community structure. This will bring about a new system of ‘Agricultural Business Management’ that can both improve production efficiency and protect small farmers’ livelihoods. Such a model is a combination of tradition and market. It should play an important role in the rural reconstruction and urbanization of central and western China. © The Author(s) 2017.},

As socialist theory requires movement away from state-centered and toward mixed economies, I examine Danish and Cuban cooperative agricultural movements, evaluating them with respect to the Rochdale Principles of cooperative production, to identify appropriate economic production forms for democratic, participatory socialism within the context of globalization. This study argues first that, to maximize efficiency, cooperative production processes must remain entirely in the hands of cooperative federations. Second, a culture of economic democracy is reinforced by the democratic principles of cooperative work. Third, an income tax would function as a more appropriate way for the Cuban state to obtain a share of returns from agricultural cooperatives than the current production quota system, to avoid disrupting cooperative incentive structures. Fourth, cooperatives can perform well in any industry, at all levels of technological development, and should be considered a dominant model for socialism. Finally, although the Rochdale Principles are based on economic and social justice, these principles and their practical application must be continually refined through further experimentation and research. © 2017 Institute for Human Geography.},

This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and biological risks are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision-makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease. © 2017 The Authors.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the characteristics of savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) that apply for the annual reporting excellence award in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs correlation and probit regression analyses to establish the factors which explain the decision by SACCOs to participate in the Financial Reporting (FIRE) excellence award. The study utilizes data consisting of 1,272 firm-year observations for 212 SACCOs, over the period 2008-2013. Findings: Consistent with institutional and legitimacy theories, the results demonstrate that structural and governance variables are significant and positively associated with the decision to participate in the annual FIRE awards by SACCOs in Kenya. Similarly, larger SACCOs and those that have adopted best cooperative governance practices are more likely to participate in the annual FIRE awards. The results also reveal that SACCOs audited by the Big 4 audit firms are more likely to participate in the annual FIRE awards. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the factors explaining the decision to participate in the annual reporting excellence awards by organizations in a specific sector. Further studies can adopt a multi-sectoral approach to investigate the same phenomenon. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of cooperative governance and resources in explaining why SACCOs choose to participate in the FIRE awards. Originality/value: The study adds onto the dearth of literature on the aspect under focus. Globally, very few studies have examined the drivers of the decision to participate in reporting excellence awards by organizations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results showed that 65.68% of the differences were caused by individual-level factors, and 34.32% were caused by provincial-level factors. The factors at the individual level, including the improvement of production equipment (IPE), education of farmers (EOF), regularization of management rules (RMR), and difficulty level of getting loans (DLL), had positive effects on growth of family farm, whereas the frequency of staff participating in training (FST) had a negative effect. At provincial level, improvement of the support policy system (IDSPS) could strengthen the positive correlation between RMR and growth of family farm. Moreover, the factor IDSPS combined with ability of agricultural cooperatives providing social services (AACPS) and spacious degree of technology access channel (SDTAC) could strengthen the positive correlation between EOF and growth of family farm, and reduced the negative correlation between FST and dependent variable. The results suggested that government should support farms to improve production equipment and financing pattern, transfer the method of re-education of grain family farmers, promote the standardization of grain family farms, establish a sound policy support system, improve the social service ability of agricultural cooperatives, and broaden the channels of technology acquisition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this paper is to explore variability in the financial performance of the largest 1,000 US farmer cooperatives with emphasis on efficiency, productivity, and leverage. Design/methodology/approach: Cooperative performance is analyzed by means of the extended DuPont identity, an accounting tool which decomposes return on equity into five ratios of efficiency, productivity, and leverage. The extended DuPont identity is applied empirically with quantile regression, which allows estimation of the statistical interrelationship of the DuPont components across the full response distribution. Findings: Per the results, variability in the financial performance of US farmer cooperatives is for the most part associated with the operating profit margin, which confirms prior findings of cost inefficiency in the empirical literature. Therefore, US farmer cooperatives may improve financial performance by emphasizing sales and operating costs. Specifically, recommendations include placing emphasis on bargaining power, product differentiation, and scale economies. Supply cooperatives may also consider issuing non-qualified equity and securing long-term debt access as additional possibilities to improve financial performance.

	abstract = {While the introduction of agro-chemicals has had positive effects on rice productivity, its application has also caused environmental pollution and biodiversity losses. To reduce the pollution, the Vietnamese government has implemented several programs to encourage eco-friendly cultivation practices to discourage the overuse of agro-chemicals. However, farmers in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta have resisted the adoption of these eco-friendly practices. The current study aimed at investigating the factors affecting the adoption of eco-friendly rice production practices. We conducted structured interviews with 202 rice farmers. Analysis using generalized ordered logit regression produced evidence that membership in agricultural cooperatives or clubs, perception of biodiversity losses, perceived ease of use, farmer experience, and the perceived difference in selling price all had positive effects on adoption, while risk perception and the number of paddy plots negatively affected the adoption. We also found that the single eco practice (adoption of one eco-friendly practice in rice farming) had the highest economic achievement. One more interesting finding is that a large proportion of farmers who use conventional methods shared similar characteristics with eco rice farmers. Based on the results, to promote the adoption of eco practices, it is necessary to create an incentive mechanism to encourage farmers to join farmer organizations. In addition, policy makers should focus on informing farmers about mitigating risks such as adverse climatic impacts, polluted water, and other environmental threats. Technical training courses and other information-sharing meetings should also be required to introduce to farmers about the benefits of eco practices. © 2018 The Author(s).

The socio-economic status of most inhabitants improved significantly as a result of the “quinoa boom”. However, it also caused severe disturbances in socio-ecological systems and posed challenges to resource governance by traditional indigenous institutions. This article focuses on the role of farmer cooperatives, in particular, and examines how their production rules may have mitigated some of the challenges associated with the quinoa boom. We assess the activities of cooperatives with the help of Elinor Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and analytic tools such as the ADICO grammar (Attribute, Deontic, aIm, Condition, Or else) and the eight design principles. The key production rules of cooperatives are examined and compliance with these rules is estimated based on semi-structured interviews and a survey conducted with quinoa producers (n=305). We argue that the cooperatives successfully contributed to alleviate pressures on resources in a context where traditional authorities were challenged by new tasks associated with land grabbing and the crowding out of diversified agricultural activities. In conclusion, we argue that collaboration between traditional authorities and farmer cooperatives holds great potential for improving the governance and sustainability of socio-ecological systems in the region. © 2018, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

	abstract = {Recent climate change has already affected maize cropping in France allowing for example earlier sowing dates in southern France and the growth of early season varieties in northern parts of the country. The climate will continue to evolve as discussed in all IPCC reports and there is a need for farmers, seed companies and agricultural cooperative corporations to be able to anticipate those changes. The ambition of our work is to provide them with the means to get ready to adapt by analyzing a) the time evolution of meteorological stresses and certain management practices throughout the crop's growth cycle, b) the impacts of climate-induced changes in calculated sowing dates on those stresses and practices. We have applied the method we developed in a former paper to study the climatic suitability of maize in two contrasted areas of France, Ile-de-France in the North and Midi-Pyrénées in the South. Three climate change scenarios, two climate models and two maize varieties distinct in terms of precocity were used to try and ensure meaningful results. Whatever the scenario, model and variety, maize will be sown earlier than it is currently the case in both regions, especially in Midi-Pyrénées. Whatever the sowing date, rising temperatures in the future will be favorable for late varieties in the current cooler areas, and therefore even farmers in Ile-de-France will be able to grow varieties with a wide range of crop cycle length. However heat and water stress will increase in both regions between flowering and maturity, irrespective of the sowing date and scenario, thereby limiting the possibility to achieve potential yields. In Midi-Pyrénées compromises will need to be found between early sowing to minimize some later stress and increasing risks of frost during emergence, that do not currently exist. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

It provides quasi-experimental evidence of the impact of membership of an agricultural co-operative on women's capabilities, their power and ability to influence decisions, and intra-household productive and reproductive labour divisions. It uses the P'KWI Farmer to Farmer Co-operative Society in north-eastern Uganda as a case study. It shows that being a member of P'KWI has a significantly positive impact on economic wellbeing, knowledge and adoption of agronomic practices, especially among women. Co-operative membership has a particularly strong positive impact on women's decision making power at the household, group and community levels. Intra-household domestic and farm related labour divisions, however, did not change as a result of co-operative membership and remain disadvantageous for women. The article concludes that agricultural co-operatives can make a significant difference for women's empowerment, provided that they actively and consistently address the bottlenecks to achieve gender equality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In the identification the elements of costs, raw material is largely the main responsible for the costs of production. The industry uses a mixed costing system and calculate the unit cost of production of yarn by the method of absorption costing using the average cost for inventory control.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate dairy processors market power in Iran. For this purpose, the dynamic imperfect competition model, in which processors are allowed to exert market power in both downstream (selling dairy products) and upstream (buying raw milk from dairy farmers) was applied. Market power parameters, dairy products demand, and raw milk supply elasticities were jointly estimated in a system of equations including market margin, dairy demand, and raw milk supply equations by none linear estimation technique. Data for the period 1992 to 2012 on the industry level were used for estimating an empirical version of the model. The result indicated that conjectural elasticities values were a departure from zero, which reflected non-competitive behavior in dairy market and in raw milk market specifically. Among three dairy products including pasteurized milk, yogurt, and cheese, the conjectural elasticity was the highest for the pasteurized market and the lowest for yogurt. The result suggests that dairy industries processors exercise marketing power in the downstream and upstream market in the dairy products supply chain. Therefore, policymakers must make appropriate policy for facilitating entrance conditions for new dairy processors and improve farmers’ marketing cooperative so as to have more competitive raw milk price. © 2018, Tarbiat Modares University.

The credit cooperatives filled an important gap and provided short-term credits for the rising number of Jewish self-employed in a more and more hostile surrounding in a country basically stripped of reserves. While the one cooperative went down in a crash in 1937, the other cooperative did business right until the pogrom if November 1938—which marked the beginning of the end of all commercial activity in Germany for Jews. © 2017.

	abstract = {Plant Clinics offer significant services to small-scale farmers in terms of crop protection advice in many developing countries, but research pertaining to the technical performance of Plant Clinics as providers of crop protection services is limited. The present study evaluated the performance of Plant Clinics in Guilan Province of northern Iran by data envelopment analysis (DEA). Data were collected through a structured questionnaire from paddy farmers and the executives of eighteen Plant Clinics in Guilan Province in northern Iran. Most Plant Clinics (61.1%) covered an area from 400 to 800 ha and most (83.3%) served up to 800 farmers, issuing between 1 and 50 prescriptions annually. The number of staff in the majority of Plant Clinics (55.6%) was between 5 and 10 people. Most Plant Clinics (55.6%) had an annual income between 150 and 250 million Iranian rials (IRR). Among 18 Plant Clinics studied, nine units had efficient performance, whereas the remaining showed inefficient operation. Efficient units tried more to absorb resources, to optimally allocate them, and to provide optimum services. Moreover, efficient units were more oriented towards clients' satisfaction and income promotion, which improved the units’ efficiency. Benchmarks were then determined for the inefficient Plant Clinics, so that the managers of those clinics can have insights into the status of those units compared with other Plant Clinics and try to fix their weaknesses and better exploit their strengths. Findings provide a framework for the evaluation of Plant Clinics as providers of crop protection services. Apart from local significance for improving the operation of Plant Clinics in Guilan Province, findings reveal critical points of intervention for improving Plant Clinics performance in other developing countries where these units operate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Agricultural cooperatives, as a form of joint work, have appeared as a necessity of the economically burdened communities and then developed into strong and influential organizations that give social and economic stability in developed countries and offer hopes and solutions in developing countries. Yet, their development and popularisation has been hindered by several factors, including political regimes such as socialism, fascism or communism, which left many people with trust issues regarding this form of organisation. Recently, the agricultural cooperatives have caught wings among both authorities and farmers and spread all around the world and in all kind of fields. In this case, the author wanted to find out if the media has a role in this sudden popularization of a two hundred years old form of organization, and if there are any other implications for the media’s involvement. For this purpose, the linguistics borrowed discourse analysis methodology was used. The results show that media articles do not only have the role of spreading information, as one would assume, but a more important one. Since the media articles have a legislative and scientific base, with a familiar vocabulary, they turn out to be intermediaries, familiar interfaces between authorities and farmers, putting the policies into more accessible words. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

	abstract = {Recent research on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has rarely included empirical observation of how land managers perceive and respond to forest governance rules. In this case study, we consider how two decades of pilot projects for integrated conservation and sustainable development (ICDPs) variously influenced forest governance across three agrarian reform settlements in northwestern Mato Grosso state. The analysis combines: i) remote sensing of deforestation from 1997–2015; ii) land use and economic data for individual settler farms and cooperatives; iii) settlers' perceptions regarding legitimacy and relevance of state policies, including land use regulations under the Brazilian Forest Code. Deforestation across settlements varied in association with synergies – or lack thereof – between policy instruments and socially embedded rules organizing economic alternatives to the dominant regional pattern of cattle ranching. In two of the settlements deforestation surpassed or was approaching 80% of their total area. In the third settlement deforestation stabilized at 45%, corresponding with the initiation of ICDP support for a pilot project focused on Brazil nut extractivism to consolidate community management of the settlement's collective forest reserve. The latter process involved a ‘policy mix’ or sequence of overlapping components: technical assistance, cooperative organization, environmental licensing, infrastructure, equitable contracts with surrounding indigenous communities and market development. Comparing with the two counterfactual cases, we suggest a framework for analysis of systemic socio-ecological change in settlements in the Brazilian Amazon, and reconsider the role of ICDPs in landscape approaches to environmental governance in tropical forests.

The major drivers for productivity differences appear to be the levels of input use, the management practices employed, the age of the operator, the ease of access to markets, and the level of engagement in extension efforts. The findings lead to a number of policy implications. First, there are high rates of return to investments in the development of better seed varieties. Second, the payoff to investments in extension efforts is also high. Third, targeting efforts to increase women's access to teff plots will improve incomes for women. Fourth, reducing the costs of remoteness through the construction of rural roads and increasing distribution outlets of modern inputs is likely to have a positive impact on teff productivity. Finally, innovations that reduce labour requirements for growing teff might satisfy the increasing demands for teff at an affordable price. © 2016 European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This article explores how voluntary certifications influence the way cooperatives provide advisory services to their members and the influence of these services on agricultural practices. Design/Methodology/Approach: Case studies were conducted in four representative Costa Rican cooperatives interviewing twenty interviewed cooperative administrators and members to determine changes in advisory services and farming practices over the past twenty years and factors which influenced those changes. Findings: Certifications induce cooperatives to offer new services to support farmers. Cooperatives form collaborations with new stakeholders or reconfigure existing collaborations to provide advisory services to their members. These services have helped to shape farmers’ attitudes about sustainable farming practices, though farm-level changes may be small. The main change at the cooperative level is adding new topics for group training, and certification issues are directly linked with practices such as maintaining a farm record book or wearing a mask when applying pesticides. Practices which compete with productivity are unlikely to change. Practical Implications: The results are useful to improve the advisory services provided by cooperatives by better identifying the key issues to be addressed to fulfill the certifications’ requirements. Theoretical implications: Cooperatives are a relevant player to induce more sustainable practices, by providing or coordinating advisory services, but their efforts cannot be seen disconnected from a broader institutional environment. Originality/Value: We demonstrate that certifications change the intensity and scope of advisory services and induce cooperatives to engage with a more diverse network of stakeholders. © 2016 Wageningen University.},

	abstract = {The bankruptcy of the fourth largest investment bank in the world Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 remains the largest bankruptcy in the history of United States. This bankruptcy is viewed as a turning point in the Global Financial Crisis. Paradoxically, even though the financial system had many safeguards (auditors, audit committees, the board of directors, credit rating agencies, government supervisors) whose purpose was to inform the investing public about the actual financial situation of the institution, Lehman Brothers bankruptcy came as a shock to financial markets across the globe revealing that many of the “gatekeepers” failed. Comparative analysis of liability cases after bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers and financial institutions in Lithuania shows that contrary to Lehman’s case, the demise of financial institutions in Lithuania cannot be attributed to sub-prime mortgages caused financial crisis, real estate market fluctuations or any other external variable. Problems are related to weak supervision, inefficient regulation, and common unethical behavior in the financial sector. © 2017, Economic Laboratory for Transition Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A study was made of measures to revitalize mountain ginseng cultivation in the eastern mountainous area of Muju, Jinan and Jangsu municipalities of North Jeolla province, South Korea. The targeted area is typical forested land and is utilized for the cultivation of ginseng. Access to seeds and seedlings for mountain ginseng cultivation is relatively easy in North Jeolla province, and the species is cultivated widely (on 63 % of the area of the province and by 74 % of farmers). This study investigated the current state of mountain ginseng cultivation and business management, including production costs and subsidy, sales and distribution system, and other business management concerns. A survey was conducted on 86 mountain ginseng-cultivating farming households living in the targeted area in 2013. It is concluded that to achieve greater production an aggressive government policy promoting the renting out of suitable sites for mountain ginseng cultivation in national and public production forestland to individual farms and farming cooperatives is necessary. Further research on increasing the survival rate of cultivated mountain ginseng (CMG) until harvesting and preventing damage by wild animals is also deemed necessary. More effective use of related municipal budget subsidy needs to be supported selectively to the enterprising farmers who aggressively pursue mountain ginseng cultivation and business management. Opening CMG retail stores to realize sustainable income growth and developing various processed products will increase farm income. The government needs to introduce policies to sustain consumer trust in CMG through initiatives such as establishing a CMG quality management system for growers, distributing government-approved seeds, and implementing a government-based CMG purchase system. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

A further examination of institutional pressures due to regulatory forces on the association between cooperative governance and credit union social and environmental disclosure (CSED) is performed. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample comprising of 1,272 credit union observations over the period 2008-2013, panel OLS regressions are performed to establish the association between co-operative governance and CSED. A comparison of the pre- and post-regulatory influences on co-operative governance and CSED is also performed. Findings - The findings, which are in support of both legitimacy and institutional theories, depict a positive and significant association between co-operative governance and CSED. The significance of the co-operative governance score improves from the pre-regulation period to the post-regulation period. Other significant variables influencing the volume of CSED by credit unions in Kenya include credit union size and financial performance as measured by the return on assets. Research limitations/implications - The study examines CSED practices in a developing country and in organizations in a single sector. Further, CSED is measured using a self-constructed index with data being obtained from audited annual reports only. Practical implications - The study highlights the need to develop CSED guidelines tailored for credit unions, and a focus on co-operative governance as a way of improving disclosure practices. Originality/value - The study utilizes a sector-specific governance variable and a CSED index to examine the association between the two variables by credit unions in a developing country. The study also attempts to investigate the role of regulation on the association between co-operative governance and the volume of CSED. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In Europe, mainly in the Mediterranean region, an intensive usage of pesticides was recorded during the past 30 years. According to information from agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley (Figueira da Foz, Portugal), Primextra® Gold TZ is the most used herbicide in corn crop fields and one of the 20 best-selling herbicides in Portugal. Copper is mainly used in pesticide formulations. This study aims to determine the ecotoxicological and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) effects of the herbicide Primextra® Gold TZ and the metal copper on marine plankton. The organisms used in this study are three planktonic species: the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, the estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa and nauplii of the marine brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Fatty acids (FAs) are one of the most important molecules transferred across the plant-animal interface in aquatic food webs and can be used as good indicators of stress. The conducted lab incubations show that T. weissflogii is the most sensitive species to the herbicide followed by A. tonsa (EC50 = 0.0078 mg/L and EC50 = 0.925 mg/L, respectively), whereas the copepod was the most sensitive species to the metal followed by T. weissflogii (EC50 = 0.234 mg/L and EC50 = 0.383 mg/L, respectively). A. franciscana was the most tolerant organism both to the herbicide and to the metal (EC50 = 20.35 mg/L and EC50 = 18.93 mg/L, respectively). Changes in the FA profiles of primary producer and primary consumers were observed, with the increase of saturated FA and decrease of unsaturated FA contents, especially of highly unsaturated FAs that can be obtained mainly from food and therefore are referred to as 'essential FA'. The study suggests that discharges of Primextra® Gold TZ or other pesticides mainly composed by copper may be a threat to plankton populations causing changes in the FA contents and thus in their nutritive value, with severe repercussions for higher trophic levels and thus the entire food web. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Because strategy formulation and management is a plan to obtain far-reaching development effects of any organization. This study aimed to present a hybrid method to formulate and choose strategies for rural cooperatives development. It combined SWOT analysis, TOWS matrix, and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). We applied brainstorming technique to analyze the external and internal environment of rural cooperatives using the contributions of an experts’ team comprising 10 individual CEOs of rural cooperatives and senior employees of the Central Organization of Rural Cooperatives. When this team identified key SWOT factors, TOWS matrix was constructed to create good strategic alternatives. Finally, ANP was applied to prioritize the strategies. According to results, 19 key strategic factors such as lack of management knowledge (W4), and ability to improve value and supply chains (S4) were identified. In addition, this team identified 11 strategic alternatives which among them Implement public policy and provide technical and financial services (SO2), Facilitate procurement of inputs and develop supply and value chains (SO1) and Involve rural cooperatives in policy planning (ST1), had greater priority in Iran. The experts’ team believed that the presented combined approach helps decision makers and managers to make and choose the best alternative strategies and factors that affect rural cooperatives development. © 2017, Tarbiat Modares University.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the farmers’ selection behavior of vegetable marketing channels, and to determine the key factors which affected farmer’ decision making. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 191 valid questionnaires were collected from 50 villages in seven main vegetable production districts in Beijing urban areas from September to December 2015, yielding a response rate of 86.8 percent. The multinomial logit model was used for analysis in this study. Findings: The results revealed that the farmers mainly selected farmers’ market, cooperative, and wholesaler to sell their vegetables, which comprised 96.57 percent of total vegetable sales. Estimation results showed that cooperative, vegetable acreage, price satisfaction, and slow sales were most important factors which influence positively the probability of opting to sell vegetables at a cooperative rather than at the farmer’s market. For wholesalers, gender of the household head and cooperative had most significantly negative effect, and age had a positive impact on farmer’s choice of market channels. Originality/value: The results and implications obtained in the present study could help policymakers to establish a scientific-based and reasonable policy to encourage vegetable producers to participate in the circulation of vegetables in Beijing and guarantee their income in vegetable supply chain.

Data were gathered from individual chain members through qualitative interviews and analyzed according to definitions of concepts in the literature and their arrangements within a conceptual framework. We identified several fragmentations that constrained value chain performance and weakened its integration. The major causes of fragmentation were a lack of value chain thinking, opportunistic traders, weak cooperative organizations, poor information sharing, and less support from the malt factory and breweries to upstream members of the chain. A conceptual framework was designed to guide future analysis, open managerial and policy dialogues, and initiate questions for future research to identify new ways of linking small-scale farmers to the large agro-processors in Sub-Saharan Africa. © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {The interest in the creation of cooperatives arises in the early nineteenth century due to the need to promote improvements in the quality of life of workers of the time. Thus, the literature on the subject asserts that the first cooperatives originated from the struggle for better living conditions and improvements in their remuneration, seeking to meet the interests of lower-income workers and rural producers. After analyzing the main factors underlying the historical evolution of cooperatives, the article presents the theoretical principles established by the Transaction Costs Theory (TCT) aiming to interpret the process of commercialization of production as carried out by agricultural cooperatives. It is understood that a cooperative consists in a complex of contracts, being an important institution that seeks to save transaction costs by internalizing the marketing of cooperative members. This fact is not much explored in the literature that discusses agribusiness in Brazil. The paper concludes that it is possible to establish a connection between TCT and the nature of agricultural cooperatives since the contracts signed reduce the risks of opportunistic behavior and the uncertainty that producers would face if they resorted to the market to transact their products. © 2016, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

We aimed to analyse whether certified smallholders gain better access to timber markets and better financial incentives. We used three smallholder forest enterprises from Gunungkidul and Kulon Progo districts, Java, Indonesia as case studies of different managerial operations. Two were farmer cooperatives and the other was an external trading company in partnership with village-level farmer groups. Different certification schemes and managerial approaches were analysed whether such factors influenced the ability of smallholders to access certified timber markets and obtain improved offers for their timber. We found that smallholders find it challenging to enter and participate in certified timber markets and to obtain the promised premium prices. The obvious costs of certification and uncertain benefits are major challenges for smallholders. Even when market opportunities are present, certification alone is insufficient to tap into these markets. Certified forest enterprises need dedicated managers with adequate entrepreneurial skills to establish networks and contacts with potential buyers, and to actively seek information on what is specified by certified timber processors. © 2017, Kassel University Press GmbH.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the theoretical and empirical possibility of measuring trust and commitment in collective actions. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs choice experiments to estimate trust implicitly as opposed to the common practice of measuring trust explicitly. Several experiments were conducted to assess members' level of trust and commitment to marketing cooperatives in rural Ethiopia. Findings - The results of the study indicate that significant number of farmers do not yet have trust in their organization and fellow members in both absolute and relative terms. The probability of trust increases when members actively participate in cooperative governance, are less diverse, stay longer in the cooperative, and when cooperatives are older. The authors also learnt that both trust and commitment have indeed improved the performance of farmers' market organizations. Trust in cooperative is asymmetrically sensitive to incentives and disincentives. Research limitations/implications - The study implied that research efforts attempting to estimate trust in collective action shall use an implicit measurement and consider the sensitivity of trust to relativeness, incentives and types of transactions. Practical implications - The findings of this study showed that rural organizations that are established with external help, such as agricultural cooperatives in Africa, seem to struggle to earn the trust of their current and potential members. This implies that given the effectiveness and persistence of informal rural organizations emerged through mutual trust, cooperatives must be organized either through informal ways as trust-based organizations or based on cooperative business principles of voluntarism and independence. Originality/value - This paper employs the behaviorally appealing choice experiment approach to capture the different aspects of trust such as relativism, sensitivity of trust to incentive and types of transactions in smallholder producers' organizations. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study aimed to analyze activities and linkages in the Thai canned lychee supply chain and to identify problems and obstacles including how to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. Data were collected from a survey of key players in the supply chain including farmers, local lychee collectors, agricultural cooperatives, canned lychee factories, exporters and importers. In addition, this research has also applied the value stream mapping (VSM) to classify the supply chain activities into three main activities include value added (VA), non- value added (NAV) and necessary non-value added activities (NNVA). After analyze value stream mapping in the current state this research found that NVA can be eliminated or reduced such as activities of intermediaries and some production process. The new VSM can reduce the supply chain activities significantly. This paper provides insights into a global fruit value chain with empirical evidence of improvement. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

(hereafter abbreviated to Jinzhong) was one of the first Chinese meat companies to establish and integrate a pig production cooperative in 2005. Over the last decade or so, Jinzhong has successfully developed the cooperative to stabilize and improve the quality of pig supply, by building relationships with pig producers (farmers) and achieving an exceptional financial performance in the process. The company-led cooperative represents an innovative supply chain governance mechanism in a Chinese context. However, the pork industry has evolved significantly and the time has come for the senior management team at Jinzhong to decide whether or not to keep the cooperative. This case study is aimed at senior undergraduate students and postgraduate students specializing in agricultural economics/ agribusiness and can also be used for executive training for the management of food companies.},

The analysis takes into account different regions of the EU Mediterranean area. Data were collected through interviews using an ad hoc questionnaire. The survey was based on a sample of 306 firms, including processors and retailers. The analysis revealed that a relevant aspect for the processing firms of organic products concerns the guaranteeing of safety and quality levels for the products. The main tools to implement the quality management are based on the adoption of specific production regulations and quality controls. The premium price most frequently applied by processors ranges from 10% to 40% and similar values are revealed for retailers. The diffusion of supply contracts allows the vertical coordination between agriculture and processing firms in the organic supply chains. The main distribution channels for the processing firms are represented by specialised shops in organic products, direct sales and supermarkets. © 2016 by the authors.},

More highly educated than men, and gender-wise, women farmers are highly self-reliant; however, their socio-economic strength is not fully capitalized through cooperative endeavors to foster productivity on their farms. This research examines women's cooperatives and the operations of women farmers in two remote rural communities using focus group discussion and targeted on-site investigation approaches. We find that over the years, small farming cooperatives are unsustainable because of their land-tenure problem, and lack of decision-making power at the grassroots level. The research suggests that the potential of women farmers in rural Jamaica has not been well utilized to foster their farming cooperatives. Crucially needed is the promotion of grassroots-based farming groupings to ensure the durability of cooperatives, as well as a multi-sector approach in agriculture, and the intensification of appropriate technological applications in all stages of farming, coupled with micro-food processing. Furthermore, a conducive environment for agricultural production and economic return requires land reform, increasing marketing opportunities, and cooperatives based on the diversification of agricultural and non-agricultural activities. © 2017 Journal of International Women's Studies.},

Land inequality was serious in the region under the Republic of Vietnam's regime. The new government struggled with agricultural collectivisation contributing to the decline in rice productivity. This study explains the persistence of a market-based agricultural production in the southern economy under the new political regime. Beside the economic reasons and arguments of local peasants' everyday politics cited in the literature, we argue that the de facto political power of the middle-class landowners was an important factor impeding the performance of agricultural cooperatives. It also implies that agricultural productivity was more vital than land inequality during the study period. We apply the model of Acemoglu and Robinson explaining how de facto political power helps elites to maintain their economic institutions in spite of a political change. © 2016 Crawford School of Public Policy of the Australian National University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This piece presents the life and work of Mayor Ferdinand Duchatsch, doctor of law and politician. As the title of the piece suggests, the author would like to especially emphasise the dual nature of his national allegiance. Even his contemporaries noted that he was Slovenian by origin, but considered himself German, although he would occasionally, especially at prelection rallies, emphasise his Slovenian origin. Ferdinand Duchatsch was born on 1. February 1845 in Maribor to his father Franc Xavier (1788-1870) and his mother Marie, born Kriehuber (1808-1900). Like his father, who became a citizen of Maribor in 1832, Ferdinand Duchatsch studied law. After his father died he took over management of his law firm. The name Duchatsch can be found among bankruptcy managers, jurors and legal advocate in lawsuits and criminal proceedings. Duchatsch's political work began with his election to the Maribor municipal council in 1869, to which he was later repeatedly elected. Unlike his father, who was disinterested in higher politics, Duchatsch managed to succeed in the wider political arena. In 1878 he was elected as a representative in the provincial assembly, two years earlier (1876) he was elected as a representative in the state parliament. In 1880 he left both positions because of, as he put it in the resignation letter, family affairs. Nevertheless, three years later he achieved the high point of his political career - the municipal council managed to get him elected as mayor of Maribor in their third attempt. He was in this position until early 1886, when he was succeeded by Alexander Nagy. The following events, that transpired while he was mayor, should be emphasised: a visit form emperor Franz Joseph I. (July 1983 and September 1885), the unveiling of a monument honouring archduke Johann (July 1883), the unveiling of a monument in honour of admiral Tegetthoff (July 1883, as the emperor was visiting), the completion of the Landwehr barracks, hospital addition, the construction of the Loška street and the connection between Tovarniška and Kopališka street, the regulation of a ditch in Graško suburbs, the regulation of Kopališka, Žička and Ribiška streets, the connection between Schmiderjeva and Verbanska street, the ratification of a plan for the cities expansion, the restoration of the cathedral, the excavation of canals in ČRNA and Brvarska streets, the purchase of two waggons and devices for pneumatic emptying of sewage tanks, the construction of the City savings bank and a girls school (both were opened in May 1886), the construction of a footbridge for connecting the Koroško suburb and the right bank of the Drava river (opened in May 1886) etc. In the time Duchatsch was mayor there were allegations made by the opposition about the in-transparent and poorly thought out budgets of the city municipality, these large debts, the choice of construction contractors and other city work past any kind of public applications, hidden financing of the newspaper Marburger Zeitung by the municipality and the influence on its editorial policy. The main objections coming from the Slovenian and catholic side was the favouring of Germans and intolerance to the Roman catholic church. Apart from political activity Duchatsch was also active in many societies and associations: Theatre and casino society, German education society, Society for the support of poor pupils, Choir society, Men's coir society, Volunteer firefighting society, Wine trader's association of Styria, Veteran society, AustroHungarian civil servant's society, Styrian horse breeder's society, Exercise society, Philharmonic society, Slovenska matica etc. He was also a member of city and district school councils, railway committee in the state parliament, auditor in Ekskompt bank, supervisor of the Fruit farmers' cooperative etc. In his private life he occupied himself with viticulture (he was one of the wine exhibitors at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873), singing (baritone), he was a popular speaker and lyric. About his appearance we only learn from the newspapers that he had a squint in one eye and a large belly. Dr. Ferdinand Duchatsch died in the Graz mental hospital Feldhof on 13 December 1887.},

	abstract = {Following the revolution in 1956, Hungary's agrarian policy went through changes and reforms unprecedented within the socialist block. The most important reform was the abolition of the system of compulsory delivery. This article aims to outline how the political change affected agrarian economics and also highlights the significant role played by some scholars, with their latent presence and their policy suggestions, which the Kádár Government had the courage to support in November 1956. With the emergence of the so-called Agrarian Lobby, of the intertwining networks of politicians, administrators, and scientists of the agrarian sector, the personal and intellectual preconditions had already been in place before 1956. Institutionalization, however, could only come about after the partial rehabilitation of market economy. The post-1956 political leadership could only meet the challenge of re-defining the relationship of the state and the agricultural cooperatives with the contribution of professionals. At the same time, the shape and nature of Kádár era agrarian economic research were also affected by the alliance between the practitioners of the field and the emerging network of agro-politicians and administrators, the Agrarian Lobby. Two key figures, Ferenc Erdei and Lajos Fehér, shared the responsibility for the better performance of agriculture. This paper also pays attention to the way their cooperation on this reform policy-oriented research was realized and the key role it played in the Hungarian agricultural cooperatives' emancipation from the bonds of the kolkhoz model in the 1960s. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

This article brings to light an important project she started in 1969, Freedom Farms Cooperative (FFC) in Sunflower County, MS. An agricultural cooperative built on 680-acres, Freedom Farms included a pig bank, Head Start program, community gardens, commercial kitchen, a garment factory, sewing cooperative, tool bank, and low-income, affordable housing as strategies to support the needs of African Americans who were fired and evicted for exercising the right to vote. Freedom Farms offered these sharecroppers and tenant farmers educational and re-training opportunities including health care and disaster relief for those who wanted to stay in the Mississippi Delta. Using a historical method to analyze extensive archival records, this article offers an analysis of Freedom Farms and illuminates valuable lessons on agriculture as resistance, and alternative strategies of rebuilding and investing in sustainable communities. Using the principles of collective and shared ownership, Freedom Farms and the work of Ms. Hamer, offer us important and valuable lessons on rebuilding our communities and investing in sustainable cities around growing food.

The process of reforming of agro-industrial complex of the Republic of Kazakhstan caused the necessity of transformation of production systems and their reduction in compliance to structural changes of agricultural production. The changes in production systems of agricultural industry of Kostanay region, which happened during development of the market relations are shown in the article; the analysis of volumes of crop production and livestock production in general on the area and on categories of farms is given. The main problems of functioning production systems are monopolization of grain production in the spring-sown field; concentration of bigger volume of production of livestock production in the farms of the population, small-scale unorganized production; seasonality of work; violation of the principle of a permanency of fixing of manpower to technical means and objects of production; ignoring of rational, specialized forms of job management; insufficient employment of a rural population in social production. All of these found reflections in performance indicators of the functioning of production systems are consequences of lack of evidence-based approach to the process of forming of their efficiency. It is proved that rural consumer cooperative has a number of advantages before other forms of conducting agricultural production.

Trust fosters cooperation in many economic and social interactions and is important to the success of traditional agricultural cooperatives. Little is known about how trust affects farmers’ willingness to cooperate to provide an ecosystem service, what types of trust are most important, and under what conditions trust may matter. In this study, we present results of a survey of Missouri crop farmers exploring the role trust plays in farmers’ stated willingness to cooperate to control pests. We find that most farmers say they are willing to cooperate, and most farmers are willing to trust others. However, we find little evidence that trust positively influences farmers’ willingness to cooperate to control pests. Instead, we find that trust may only matter under certain conditions, such as when participants’ farms are dissimilar, and that other determinants, such as the perceived benefit of cooperation and environmental concern, are more important than trust to farmers who are contemplating cooperation to control pests. © 2016 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze a model of credit union, which allows meeting demands of microcredit of family farmers in a responsible way, identifying the real needs of clients and promoting financial access. Originality/value: In recent years, the microfinance community has witnessed unwanted consequences of microcredit misuse. We present an original approach about the way credit unions may achieve their target in a responsible way, offering appropriate products, services and training to the entire community involved. Design/methodology/approach: Through secondary data and interviews with decision makers and credit union members, we studied the case of Cresol Baser, a large credit union in Brazil. We analyzed data based on inductive theorizing. First and second-order themes were identified, resulting in a procedural model, representing relationships between responsible microfinance factors. Findings: The three main dimensions in the model of inclusive microfinance - conditions, proximity, and access - were integrated in order to promote a dynamic that respects the assumption of a responsible financial inclusion with regards to design, offer and access of products and services related to microfinance. © 2017 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

The study analyses the views of 106 preparers of SACCO disclosures. Principal Component-Factor analyses and ordinary least squares regression approaches are utilized to establish significant disclosure items and drivers. The findings show that SACCO disclosures are mainly addressed to members and the regulator. SACCOs provide disclosures to comply with regulations as well as build their image. The results reveal that disclosures by SACCOs in Kenya mainly center on mandatory financial aspects, which is followed by voluntary disclosure on strategic aspects, social aspects, governance aspects and environmental conservation in that order. The findings show that disclosures by SACCOs in Kenya are positively influenced by governance. According to the findings, the influence of the disclosure guidelines issued by the professional accounting body in Kenya and financial performance on disclosure seem to be weak.Other significant drivers of disclosure by SACCOs include resources (assets) and licensing.The findings are useful to policy makers in designing anoptimal disclosure policy for SACCOs in a developing country context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper reports a study that applied a choice experiment method in a novel setting to increase understanding of the preferences of investors in agricultural firms. A large questionnaire dataset consisting of 845 financially literate subjects enabled testing of the form in which residual and control rights provide incentives for non-producer investors to invest in agricultural firms. The choice experiment data were analyzed using a latent class model. The results demonstrate that the subjects were interested in the currently hypothetical, new types of investment instruments in agricultural producer cooperatives. Three investor classes were distinguished based on the preferences: returnseeking, ownership-oriented and risk-averse investors. Who controls the firm appears to be irrelevant concerning willingness to invest, while the rural ties of the respondent are positively related to the preference for voting rights. © 2017, MTT Agrifood Research Finland.

In addition to linking smallholders to markets, cooperatives provide their members with various services, such as extension, credit, input subsidies, and social programmes. While the literature contains many examples of success, there has been limited discussion on the often long and turbulent process by which cooperatives develop over time and the viable options for shortcuts. This study examines four emerging cocoa cooperatives in Peru to determine their overall business viability, the key factors that advanced their development, and their capacity to address the needs of their members. Our findings suggest that strategies for supporting cooperative development have largely failed to address major internal weaknesses and the challenges posed in the external environment. The cooperatives have received time-bound, uncoordinated, and often small-scale, interventions, which have focused on infrastructure expansion and technical assistance. Important areas related to business management and governance structures, trust relationships with buyers, and sufficient working capital have largely been ignored. Shortcuts may be achieved through improvements in access to business development and financial services, deeper engagement by private sector to support the development process, and commitment by stakeholders to monitoring and critical reflection for strategy refinement. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

With this in mind, the article focuses on a specific type of firms: cooperative credit banks. They are habitually seen as institutions which show a clear orientation toward ethics because their main objective is to provide direct benefits to internal and external stakeholders. To this aim, through an empirical investigation of their Websites, we analyze the propensity of these banks to provide Social Reports. Within the stakeholder management theory, the attention to mission, the number of stakeholders identified, the prospects of social reporting and their structure, and other aspects, are analyzed. Although many researches show that banking systems with a high number of cooperative banks can handle future potential periods of financial stress more efficiently, on the empirical side, the survey highlights that these banks are not ready yet to address the growing audience of potential customers who seem to be more interested in the respect of ethical and social conditions. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

	abstract = {To pursue development goals, policymakers and scholars alike have proposed that actors in rural areas may usefully engage in collective actions, e.g. by forming community groups, producer associations or multi-actor networks. One proposed benefit of such collaborations is the enhanced knowledge exchange and learning which may be created, and in the literature the dynamics of this are often explained via the concepts of embeddedness and/or social capital. To date however, studies tend towards a somewhat narrow, territorial, interpretation of these concepts, with the result that current understanding of how collaborations and learning evolve between rural actors is rather constrained. This paper aims to explore a broader interpretation of these concepts, through case analysis of a producer cooperative in the Scottish shellfish sector. In the case, the realities of member and management relations are revealed, along with the types of knowledge generated and the processes by which these are, or are not, shared between actors. In terms of embeddedness, our analysis reveals that, rather than the local community context which tends to dominate the literature, it is sectoral norms and habits which shape actor relations and learning most significantly in this case. In terms of social capital, we identify that tension-fuelled social relations are not in themselves a barrier to collaboration, again in contrast to existing claims, particularly where key actors have appropriate interpersonal skills, and where a values-based mindset ('cooperative know-how') is held in common. The findings therefore challenge popular assumptions about how embeddedness and social capital shape collective action and learning in rural areas, and illustrate the value of interpreting these concepts more expansively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

To achieve the proposed aim, an exploratory qualitative study of the four cooperatives operating in the sheep meat production chain in the State of Paraná in the year 2016 was done. Managers of these cooperatives and production chain experts were interviewed. For the analysis of results, cooperatives were classified into two groups: those which engage in various agro-industrial activities, and those which work exclusively in the sheep industry. The results obtained showed that there is not a single sheep production technological standard in the State of Paraná, and that cooperatives already worked in other agribusiness segments, the sheep industry being an additional activity in the portfolio of these companies, which seem to achieve better results by including this activity, involving higher expectations of expansion and seeking strategies to overcome major challenges, especially those related to animal slaughter and meat/meat by-product processing. © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

The work started with a documentary analysis and an accounting technique, named vertical analysis; in the next step, we used Mann-Whitney test to compare the formative lines of DRE of the a set of 15 cooperatives and 14 non-cooperative companies discriminated as belonging to organizations with higher sales in agricultural production in 2013. The results confirm the extent of the cooperatives structure in relation to the business portfolio, given the remarkable activities in concentric and conglomerate diversification. We observed the competitive parity between the business segments analyzed, mainly because there were no differences in the final rates of "profitability" when we compare the two cases. In addition, we can apparently refute the idea that this competitive parity is given by an orientation excessively directed to the market, at the expense of a social orientation, given the differentiating points externalized.},

Key principles identified for effective PAR agroecological processes include a shared interest in research by partners, a belief in collective power/action, a commitment to participation, practicing humility and establishing trust and accountability. Important lessons to consider for future work include: (1) research processes that did not start as PAR, can evolve into it; (2) farmer/stakeholder participation in setting the research agenda, from the outset, results in higher engagement and enhanced outcomes; (3) having the right partners for the desired outcomes is key; (4) intentional and explicit reflection is an essential component of PAR processes; and (5) cross-generational collaborations are crucial to long-term benefits. Key challenges that confront PAR processes include the need for time and resources over longer periods; the complexity of multi-actor process facilitation; and institutional barriers within the academy and development organizations, which prevent shifting investment towards integrated PAR agroecological processes. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore how the implementation of enterprise risk management (ERM) practices can help organisations to pursue both economic and social goals. To do so, we look at the credit cooperative banking sector, which often attempts to conduct socially responsible business practices. To deepen our understanding of how such banks deal with risk, we provide an in-depth study of one credit cooperative bank. The analysis highlights the peculiarities of ERM practices implemented in a specific context and explains how an ERM system enables credit cooperative banks to manage the risks associated with a duality of purpose. This research is relevant from a theoretical perspective because it addresses new trends in the risk management literature, thus elucidating how ERM systems can be implemented to support dual-purpose organisations. The study also adds to the literature on ethical banking, as it offers an in-depth description of how ERM systems work in this particular context. This paper also has practical implications; it provides insights to similar banks on how to manage risk in a way that supports social development in their local communities. Our analysis is also of interest to other types of socially-oriented businesses, which may follow a similar approach to operationalise ERM practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

The impact of vertical coordination mechanisms in local food supply chains in developing countries remains underexplored. This paper analyzes the impact of participation of honey producers in the Northern highlands of Tigray, Ethiopia in contracts and marketing cooperatives on their performance and wellbeing. The paper finds positive production and economic gains honey producers obtain from contract engagement. Honey producers under the contract scheme produce more white honey fulfilling the demand of processors, buyers and consumers. Contracting results in higher production due to the better access it causes to technology and skill transfers. Moreover, better conditions contracts offer motivates honey producers to produce more and supply larger to the market. © 2016, Alemu et al.},

We have designed a capabilities and abilities (CA)-BDI farmer decision-making model, which is an extension of the BDI architecture and includes internal representations for farmer household Capabilities and Abilities. This model is used to explore farmer learning mechanisms and to simulate the bounded rational decisions made by farmer households. Our case study focuses on the Gaoqu Commune of Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, China, where scallion is one of the main cash crops. After comparing the differences between actual land-use changes from 2007 to 2009 and the simulation results, we analyze the validity of the model and discuss the potential and limitations of the farmer land-use decision-making model under three scenarios. Based on the design and implementation of the model, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the CA-BDI framework is an appropriate model for exploring learning mechanisms and simulating bounded rational decisions; and (2) local governments should encourage scallion planting by assisting scallion farmer cooperatives and farmers to understand the market risk, standardize the rules of their cooperation, and supervise the contracts made between scallion cooperatives and farmers. © 2016, The Author(s).},

First, major shortcomings of dominating approaches for assessment of sustainability of farming enterprises like individual and family farms, agro-companies, agro-cooperatives etc. are summarized, and the needs for improvement underlined. Second, evolution of the “concept” and the major approaches for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises is discussed. More adequate definition of the farming enterprise’s sustainability is suggested as ability of a particular form to maintain its governance, economic, social and ecological functions in a long term. Finally, a specific for the conditions of Bulgarian agriculture framework for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises is proposed. The later includes a system of appropriate principles, criteria, indicators, and reference values for evaluating governance, economic, ecological and social aspects of farming enterprise’s sustainability as well as an approach for their integration and interpretation. The ultimate objective of this study is to work out an effective framework for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises of different type in the specific economic, institutional and natural environment, assist farm and agro-business management and strategies, and agricultural policies and forms of public intervention in agrarian sector. © 2015, ASERS Publishing House.

The plot- scale experiment was established in years 2013/14 and 2014/15 within the agricultural cooperative in Mojmírovce. There were four fertilization treatments on 600 m2 experimental plots in three replications in this experiment. The first treatment was unfertilized control. Other three treatments were fertilized by the same nitrogen dose of 160 kg.ha-1 and by increasing doses of sulphur. The second treatment was fertilized by a dose of 15 kg.ha-1 S, the third by a dose of 40 kg.ha-1 and a dose of 65 kg. ha-1 S was applied at the fourth treatment. The highest average yield 3.96 t.ha-1 was found when a dose of 40 kg.ha-1 S was applied. The application of sulphur in a dose of 65 kg.ha-1 was accompanied by a yield decrease by 11.4 % as compared to the treatment where a sulphur dose of 40 kg.ha-1 was used. An average oil content of 45.1, 45.5, and 44.0 % was found in treatments in which the doses of sulphur of 15, 40 and 65 kg.ha-1 were applied. No significant difference among the treatments fertilized by sulphur was found. The average oil production reached 1809, 1802 and 1595 kg.ha-1 in cases of treatments fertilized by sulphur doses of 15, 40 and 65 kg.ha-1.},

Two agricultural cooperatives of family farmers in the municipality (the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Goiás (Federação dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura do Estado de Goiás - FETAEG) and the Union of Rural Workers of Rio Verde (Sindicato dos Trabalhadores Rurais de Rio Verde)), representatives from four of the five companies that operate in the city’s biodiesel sector and that have been awarded the Social Fuel Seal (Selo Combustível Social - SCS) and 43 family farmers in Rio Verde who belong to the PNPB participated in this research (defined from an intentional non-probability sample). It was found that governance using contracts has been unable to limit possible opportunistic actions in the municipality. Uncertainty was identified on the part of the producers regarding their loyalty to cooperatives and companies as a result of prior unfavorable experiences, particularly in relation to the price charged by certain companies. Finally, the contract, while offering guarantees, may be adverse for the producer. © 2017, Universidade de Taubate. All rights reserved.},

By identifying economic and non-economic incentives to be members of cooperatives, our conceptual framework is novel. Our empirical work analyzes panel data from 2001–2009 for Finnish cooperative banks and compares two empirical concepts of the membership ratio. We find evidence that monetary incentives are important reasons to join, but also the size of the community from which members are recruited plays a role. Over time, monetary incentives have increased and this may have contributed to faster growth in membership in cooperatives based in larger municipalities after these changes. Cooperatives attracting new members primarily on the basis of monetary rewards is also consistent, over time, with a reduction in the role of the common bond. © 2016 The AuthorsAnnals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC},

However, most existing environmental policies consider ecosystems' desirable properties as given, leading ecosystem managers to favor "turnkey" solutions. How could public policy better support local collective initiatives aiming at reconciling agriculture and the environment? This paper presents an empirical case study from western France, in which a partnership between an agricultural cooperative and an ecological research center resulted in a collective design initiative. We conceptually model this initiative drawing upon recent design theories and Georgescu-Roegen's 'fund-flow' model, defining 'ecological funds' as the starting point of a collective design process. The results highlight the importance of developing policy instruments that can better support local innovation processes through greater democratization. Adopting a design approach to sustainable agricultural landscape management could be particularly fruitful in situations where collective action is necessary but where there is no common good recognized as such, and no existing community identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We develop a classification of traditional versus restructured cooperative organizational attributes based on an inductive approach. Using this classification and integrating concepts from the business literature (i.e., market and brand orientation), we hypothesize three types of relationships: (a) the influence of organizational attributes, i.e., ownership, control and cost/benefit allocation, on organizational performance; (b) the influence of strategic, i.e., market and brand orientation, attributes on organizational performance, and (c) the influence of organizational attributes on market orientation. We examine these relationships empirically in two studies. In study 1, using data from 114 agribusiness cooperatives, we demonstrate that strategic attributes have a greater influence on organizational performance than organizational attributes. In study 2, we replicate the design from study 1, i.e., tracking attribute scores over time, with a subsample of 25 cooperatives 4 years later. This second study generally confirms the findings of study 1. Taken together, the results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on strategic attributes both in the literature and in practice. © 2016 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, recently researchers reported that one of their primary challenges to their expansion is the high level of inefficient. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between growth and efficiency of SACCOS using economies of scale concept. Then we address the role of management of the capital structure and allocation of resources in the expansion of SACCOS. The study used financial statement data from 60 SACCOS in Tanzania for the period of 2004-2011. The findings supports that most of SACCOS are small and cost inefficient because the industry is young, but, the efficiency increases as SACCOS expand. Second the allocation of resources in liquid, financial and non-financial investment leads to no expansion in SACCOS. Thus, the growth of SACCOS via increasing loan to members, members' savings, shares, and institutional capital should be encouraged as it increases the efficiency of SACCOS. Also, SACCOS should minimize the allocation of assets in other investments which are different from credit to members. © 2016 CIRIEC.},

	abstract = {About 100 million rural households in China have obtained forest property certification, which could serve as collateral to help households obtain microloans intended for forest management and investment. However, it is still difficult for households to receive these loans using forests as collateral. The strong demand for loans from the Rural Credit Cooperative cannot be met. This paper attempts to understand microloan access behavior using 241 respondents in three typical Chinese counties. It argues that the loan is determined by both the demand from the household as well as the supply from banks. Logistic regression models are used to investigate what might affect accessibility to households’ microloans. Household characteristics like age, education, income, forest characteristics as well as the regional variation of loans are used as explanatory variables. Age, education and income as well as the perception of the bank services are found statistically significant. Other findings include that only half of the respondents who received loans supposed for forest management but use for other purposes. Most importantly, it is found that joint-loan arrangement is more suitable for small-scale households and direct-loan and guaranteed-loans are better match larger property size. A simplified loan-process and discount points would lower transaction costs and improve rural households’ accessibility to microloan using of forest property collateral. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

	abstract = {Takāful is an insurance mechanism which satisfies the religious values of Muslim consumers and which has exhibited steady growth in Islamic finance systems. However, takāful does not comprise a significant share of the global insurance market, which is dominated by stock-based, mutual and cooperative organisations. Despite literature advocating its appeal to non-Muslim consumers, there is a gap in research exploring consumer behaviour in this demographic group. This qualitative phenomenological study utilises the theory of planned behaviour as a framework to explore the beliefs and attitudes towards takāful among non-Muslim consumers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to identify potential salient mutual-cooperative and religious attributes. The data demonstrate that non-Muslim consumers are unfamiliar with takāful products and this knowledge deficiency generates attitudes that negatively influence decision making; however, the provision of product information reveals that faith-based attributes create beliefs that may be salient to attitude formation and influence decision making when applied to the theory of planned behaviour. This study is important for takāful researchers in advancing the discussion on non-Muslim consumer behaviour, and for takāful operators in understanding non-Muslim behavioural influences as part of a strategic expansion of that demographic. The results suggest further research is required to identify takāful’s salient attributes and their influence in the decision-making process for non-Muslims. In addition it asks what marketing and promotional strategies should be employed to improve awareness and understanding of takāful among non-Muslims. © 2016, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

Design/methodology/approach – Given that different indicator variables were used to measure apple quality, the authors employed a principle component analysis method to reduce the measurement dimension. An ordinary least square regression was employed to analyse the effects of member size and selective incentives of agricultural cooperatives on product quality. Findings – The empirical results show that member size and cooperative’s product quality bear an inverse “U-shape” relationship, and food safety certification and target market variables tend to positively and significantly influence cooperative’s product quality. In particular, the cooperatives with more food safety certificates and targeting supermarkets and export enterprises are more likely to supply high-quality products. Originality/value – This study provides the first attempt to measure apple quality and investigate the factors that influence cooperative’s product quality. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The article presents the influence assessment of significance of some selected variables from the entrepreneurs' accounting system on the achieved profit or loss of the agricultural companies in the Slovak Republic. Accounting information serves as an active tool for internal users for operational as well as strategic company management, and for external users the information is determined as legally binding output information which is a subject to disclosure. Individual financial statements of assessed agricultural companies are considered to be the relevant source of information. Agricultural companies are represented by commercial companies and agricultural cooperatives. Profit or loss after income tax presents the final complex effect of economic company's performance. The existence and development of companies is conditioned by assets which amount and structure depend on focus and the range of subject activity but as well as on specific factors set by the production process in the agricultural primary production. The increase in liabilities is notable by the influence of unsufficient amount of own company funding sources, mainly the increase in trade payables. The continuance of company reproduction process is secured by a bank loan drawdown. The income situation of companies of agricultural primary production is favourably influenced by the subsidies of non-investment character. During the observed period of years 2004 - 2014 the examined variables were assessed by means of statistical methods. The obtained results of rate determination of statistical correlation between selected variables by means of classical canonical analysis and non-parametric correlation analysis secured that in the assessed group of companies all analysed variables influenced statistically significantly profit or loss after income tax, mainly the total value of assets and non-investment subsidies, except for years 2010, 2012 a 2013, when the statistically insignificant correlations was determined between profit or loss and especially short-term trade payables and current bank loans. As regards the existence point of view it is recommended to companies to maintain the optimal assets and capital structure as well as the achievement of suitable profitability of company's activity. Only the complex attitude towards the subject issue can be the assumption of sustainability for companies of agricultural primary production in the Slovak Republic and the increase in their performance. © 2017 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences, License.},

Responding to high charge-off rates for these loans and concern for systemic risk, the National Credit Union Administration imposed in 2013 new rules on federally insured credit unions that limited the purchase of loan participations from a single originator to the greater of $5 million or 100% of net worth. This study uses a difference-in-difference framework to examine the effect the policy had on returns. As a result of the policy change, credit unions with a high share of net worth in loan participations earned, on average, a return on assets 47 basis points less than their counterparts. Further, we find evidence that suggests these lower returns were driven by a decline in participation loans with recourse provisions, liquidity issues, and relatively higher interest expenses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Due to increased governance through universal codes, standards and certification, Fairtrade risks becoming an abstract ethical and regulatory tool, disconnected from the moral economies of those poor farmers it is intended to benefit. In response, the paper makes a case for a deeper understanding of the moral economies of farmers involved in Fairtrade networks and the ways in which these emerge out of moral experiences that are deeply embedded in local social and cultural relations. Through a case study of Eksteenskuil Agricultural Cooperative in South Africa’s Northern Cape, it seeks to demonstrate the importance of understanding the moral experiences of producers to better consider what is at stake for them, focusing on notions of cooperation, fairness and the ‘good farmer’, perceptions of community, and concerns with survival and self-sufficiency. The paper concludes that working in culturally-sensitive ways with producer communities and understanding how their local moral worlds are structured is vital in bridging the gap between abstract ethical discourses and the place-based moral experiences of producers, and to ensuring the effectiveness of Fairtrade initiatives. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten committees of management members, ten professional managers and seven co-operative consultants. The study reveals a lack of application of both incentive and monitoring schemes in these entities. An over-emphasis on cost effectiveness is resulting not only in the current little application of such schemes, but also in obstacles towards the application of new ones in the future. Furthermore, any application of monitoring schemes in particular is perceived as having negative implications on the level of trust between the monitor and the monitored. Additionally, few incentives are being applied to promote co-operative principles despite the declared management willingness to do so. The study points out that a number of lacunas need to be overcome for the realization of both types of schemes. Co-operative managers need to become more aware of the objectives of their co-operative and also more determined towards promoting the co-operative principles. The paper also concludes that no trust implications need to arise in the implementation of any type of scheme as long these are well designed, explained and implemented. One recommended way towards promoting monitoring schemes is the introduction of an updated Co-operative Societies Act including new obligations on the internal control environment.},

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's (UNESCO) has included Langkawi's 99 islands in its global geopark network. One of the most popular geopark sites in Langkawi is Kilim Karst, originally developed as a fishing community under the management of the Kilim Community Cooperative Society (KCCS). Following Kilim's recognition as a geopark, the role of the KCCS has evolved to encompass the management of local geotourism activities, ensuring that the community's involvement is consistent with UNESCO's sustainable development benchmarks. This study discusses the role played by geoparks and geotourism in the cooperative community entrepreneurship of local populations. Using the interview method, the authors consider the role of community-based entrepreneurships in developing geotourism in Kilim. With the full cooperation of the local government, the KCCS helps to develop local entrepreneurs who lack fundamental business knowledge. The authors review the performance of the KCCS based on their 2011-2014 annual general meeting report. The results of this review, coupled with the growing number of tourists, reveal the success of the KCCS' commitment to supporting local entrepreneurship. The proceeds of these activities have subsequently been redirected to the diversification of the KCCS' business portfolio for the sustainability of the community. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

A propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) models are used to estimate treatment effects by controlling for selection biases. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through group discussions made with randomly selected farmers in the study area. Findings indicate that the probability of farmers' membership decision increases with age, education level, family size, social networks, land property and accessibility to cooperatives. Both PSM and ESR models show that membership is positively associated with household income and assets. The ESR estimation results further confirm that members economically perform significantly better than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better than members if they had joined cooperatives. The results of group discussions also verify overall direct and spill-over effects, though cooperative services to members and non-members are undifferentiated. The results indicate a need for a mechanism to enhance the participation of poorer farm households, and to further improve member benefits as potential areas in making cooperatives more meaningful, attractive and sustainable. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the drivers of profitability in pig farming in Wakiso district that surrounds Kampala city, the capital of Uganda. One hundred pig farms were sampled in a random and purposive procedure and data were collected using a standard pretested questionnaire. Production and management of pigs was affected by lack of organizational strategies to achieve economies of scale at farm level, poor access to market information, limited use of fair and meaningful quality standards, feed shortages during the dry season, disease risks such as African swine fever, and limited access to extension services, agricultural insurance, credit and other financial services. We found that the profit per pig was UShs.17495. Experience in years, amount of land area under piggery use, number of workers, number of pigs sold, making and use of budgets, record keeping and availability of extension services were found to have a significant relationship at 5% with the profit made from piggery business. The piggery business can be made more profitable by establishing farmer groups through which they can save some money and build capital for further investment in their farms. Cooperatives from where farmers can borrow money to support their farming activities should also be introduced. Farmers should be provided with proper extension services, genetically better and more disease resistant pig breeds. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.},

The study incorporated 151 farm households in Gozamin District, East Gojjam, in Ethiopia. A survey questionnaire was used to gather data. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used as methods of data analysis. The result indicated that livelihood diversification, measured by the inverse Herfindahl–Hirschman diversity index, has a positive and significant effect on sustainable land management activities. Besides, farm households who participated in agricultural extension packages and those engaged in farm cooperatives and in non-farm wage employment activities joined significantly more in sustainable rural land management practices. The integrated rural livelihood and sustainable land management strategy that can help jointly maximise the farm household livelihood and the land management practices is required. Rural livelihood development policies need to promote and adapt rural institutions like farm cooperatives and comprehensive agricultural extension services. © 2017 The Author(s).},

In this archival study, resource dependency theory and agency analysis are combined to provide theoretical insight and empirical analysis of gender diversity on effective financial management in member-governed, community financial institutions. The investigation is possible due to the unique characteristics of the organisational form and region being examined—credit unions in Northern Ireland. The sector has not been subject to external regulation on board gender, yet a wide array of gender mix on boards ranging from 100 % male to 100 % female are in existence. In addition, effective financial management is crucial to their survival and their ability to meet member objectives. Boards with higher female representation exhibit superior financial management first, in respect of loan book quality in the period of austerity following the financial crisis and second when measured against return on assets. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Findings indicate that for both cooperatives, innovation was predominantly spread through formal vertical linkages (i.e. between hierarchal representatives), but was significantly controlled by key actors in leadership positions, resulting in large disparities in the innovation potential of different cooperative members.

Social benefits that farmers may use to get by (bonding networks) had two dimensions: emotional support and social support. Social benefits that farmers may use to get ahead (bridging networks) also had two dimensions: tangible and intangible resource sharing. The desire to gain these social benefits from cooperation (except for emotional support) emerged as strong predictors of farmers' willingness to cooperate in a proposed new agricultural cooperative. Surprisingly, the expected economic benefits of cooperation did not have a significant effect on willingness to cooperate.

Marine Areas for Responsible Fishing (Áreas Marinas de Pesca Responsable, AMPR) have emerged as a new model for the co-management of small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica, one that involves collaboration between fishers, government agencies, and NGOs. The primary objective of this paper is to elucidate some of the key variables that influence collective action among small-scale fishers in Tárcoles, a community in the Gulf of Nicoya. We examined collective action for the formation of a local marketing cooperative and participation in management through the AMPR. We apply the social-ecological framework as a diagnostic and organizational tool in the analysis of several types of qualitative data, including interviews with key informants, informal interviews, legal documents, and gray literature. Findings illustrate the importance of socio-economic community attributes (e.g., group size, homogeneity, previous cooperation), as well as that of social (e.g., equity) and ecological (e.g., improved stocks) outcomes perceived as favorable by actors. In addition, our work demonstrates the importance of certain kinds of external NGOs for facilitating and sustaining collective action. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the advantages equity capitalization programs based on retained earnings from patronage sources may provide cooperatives and their patrons that traditional equity financing methods do not offer. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a model used to assess patron benefits from a cooperative that is financed by a combination of allocated equity acquired from noncash patronage refunds and unallocated equity acquired from retained earnings. The level of patron benefits is represented by the present value of the after-tax cash flow patrons receive from the cooperative, and the model is used to determine the combination of noncash patronage refunds and retained earnings that provides the greatest present value given the levels of those parameters that affect capitalization of the cooperative and the distribution of cash benefits to patrons. Findings: The analysis demonstrates that only pure plans, i.e., plans based entirely on retained patronage refunds or entirely on retained earnings, will be associated with the greatest present value for any particular set of parameter values. Cooperatives that are characterized by low marginal tax rates and growth rates and whose patrons are characterized by high marginal tax rates and discount rates are those most likely to benefit from equity capitalization programs based on retained earnings. Research limitations/implications: The model is based on the assumption of constant parameter values and does not account for the existence of nonpatronage income. Practical implications: A useful extension of this work would be the development of a decision aid capable of generating basic operating statement and balance sheet data and enabling cooperative decision makers to conduct experiments concerning alternative financing strategies based on retained earnings. Originality/value: The analysis contained in this paper is based on an explicit model and extends across a broad range of values for various parameters that affect the level, timing, and present value of cash distributions from cooperatives. Because the cash flow received by patrons is determined after the cooperative’s planned equity growth is met, cash flow comparisons are equivalent with respect to the capital provided the cooperative. In addition, the revolving period is endogenously determined. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The study used qualitative research strategies including desk study, case study, and focus group discussions. The study compared the involvement of three milk collecting actors that were classified into large cooperative (KPSBU), small cooperative (KUD Puspa Mekar), and private company (Bina Kitri Bersama). A total of 18 dairy farmers, 3 milk collecting actors, 2 milk processors, and one livestock officer were interviewed. Three focus group discussions were conducted. The large cooperative performed better in services, milk collection, and milk quality assessment compared to other milk collecting actors. Members' commitment, inconsistent milk quality, and shortage of good quality fodder were the hindering factors that influenced the collection of good quality milk in the large cooperative. In conclusion, the large cooperative had better performance in service provision, it also had better infrastructures in milk collection and milk quality assessment compared to other milk collecting actors. Increasing the milk quality standard by milk processing companies affected the milk price since 2000.},

Similar to other economic organisations, agricultural cooperatives have witnessed structural changes in recent decades in terms of governance and/or management models. Portuguese agricultural cooperatives have been compelled by their context to adopt a traditional model of ownership and control. The main goal of this study was to analyse issues related to the management structure and financial performance of cooperatives, based on data collected for olive oil cooperatives located in the northern interior region of Portugal. Combining a qualitative analysis of structure and decision-making, a financial assessment and the application of a multi-criteria approach (PROMETHEE II), the overall results are in line with expectations (e.g. low levels of member participation, nonprofessional management, low profitability ratios, low leverage and an ability to fulfil financial commitments), except for the relationship between professional management and financial performance. The existence of professional management does not lead to better financial performance. This result reinforces the belief that cooperatives that are structured differently have different and conflicting stakeholder interests.},

	abstract = {An on-farm trial of carp polyculture was carried out with participation of women farmers from Sundardeep Women Fish Farmer's Cooperative (15 women farmers) in Chitwan District and Mishrit Fish Farmer's Cooperative (22 women farmers) in Nawalparasi District to field-test the enhancing effect of periphyton on use of feed and fish production. The trial was conducted for 8 months from April to December 2015. Women farmers stocked six carp species and two small indigenous species (SIS) to ponds. Women farmers were divided into two groups. One group fed their fish with dough of rice bran and mustard oil cake, while the other group installed bamboo substrates in their ponds and fed their fish with half the amount of the feed used by the first group. Women farmers netted and weighed fish monthly to check fish growth and calculate rations. Women farmers were provided with a book to record fish harvested for consumption or sale and fish mortality. Final harvest was done after 8 months of culture. The netted fish were counted, weighed, and returned to the pond as the farmers wanted to keep fish for their biggest festival "Maghi" in mid-January. In aggregate, 84 % of farmers consumed fish at home, and 41 % of farmers sold carps. The trial showed that culturing carps with SIS with 50 % feeding amount and with bamboo substrates in ponds resulted in a 22 % higher fish production as compared to the culture of carps with normal feeding. More interestingly, the gross margin of the half-fed periphyton enhanced carp polyculture was almost two times as much as that of the normal fed polyculture system. Women farmers also benefited socially as well as economically from the interactions within the cooperatives, which increased their self-confidence and developed leadership skills in some members. © Asian Fisheries Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether negative incentives in the pay-for-performance mechanism would trigger loan officers to strategically reject potentially good loans. If so, what is the feasible solution to alleviate the problem. Design/methodology/approach: A framed field experiment was conducted to test loan decision behaviors using loan officers from Rural Credit Cooperatives in Shandong, China. A 2 by 2 between-subject design was adopted to generate variation in incentives and prior information about credit risks. Findings: Results showed that loan officers did ration credit by rejecting more loans when facing risks of personal income loss. However, providing risk information about the application pool boosted the approval rate and offset the behavioral responses by a roughly same magnitude. Research limitations/implications: Findings in this study suggest that certain institutional settings can result in credit rationing via strategic loan misclassification. Further, information sometimes generates similar effects as those costly incentives or mechanisms that are not implementable in practice. Originality/value: This study adopted an innovative monetized experimental design that allows researchers to examine the (otherwise unobservable) trade-offs between Type I and Type II error in loan misclassification as incentives change. In addition, an anchoring prior information treatment is used to solicit the relative power of almost costless information and costly monetary incentives, and to point out a potentially feasible solution. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this approach, the efficient management is crucial to that cooperatives offer the best that have to their members. Given the above, the purpose of the study is to analyze the efficiency of Brazilian credit unions, the CAMELS model. The research is descriptive, with documentary procedure and quantitative approach to the problem. Consolidated financial statements, disclosed by credit unions, available in the Central Bank’s website (2014), performed data collection. For the data analysis was applied the factor analysis, data envelopment analysis and absolute frequency. The survey sample consists of the 25 largest credit unions that make up the Central Bank ranking. The results show that the applicability of CAMELS model to determine the efficiency of credit unions offer relevant information to decision makers. Finally, it is concluded that 76% of the top 25 ranking of the Central Bank of credit unions were efficient in all periods analyzed. We conclude that the CAMELS model can be used as a complement to determine the efficient performance of the credit union, and a related advance to previously existing models such as the PEARLS and CAMEL. © 2017, Universidade de Taubate.

	abstract = {Research Question/Issue: This research investigates the antecedents of board members’ monitoring behaviors at the individual level. The main idea is that individuals who are both conscientious and identified with shareholders are those most likely to adopt monitoring behaviors. Research Findings/Insights: The study was conducted using a survey of 166 board members of a large Canadian credit union corporation. Data on monitoring behaviors were collected directly from the chairpersons of the boards they participate in. The results validate the hypothesized moderated mediation model in which perceived importance of monitoring by board members mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and actual monitoring behaviors, on the one hand, and identification with shareholders moderates the relationship between conscientiousness and the perception of the importance of monitoring, on the other hand. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By investigating the mediating effect of the perceived importance of the monitoring role in the relationship between conscientiousness and monitoring behaviors, our study provides an empirical test of the attention-based view in the context of boards of directors and thus contributes to opening the ‘black box’ of board behaviors. Further, by looking at the interactive effect of conscientiousness and identification with shareholders, our study brings new insights into the motivational drivers of directors’ monitoring behaviors. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study invites practitioners in charge of board members’ recruitment and selection to reconsider their practices in order to target individuals demonstrating high levels of conscientiousness. It also highlights the importance of implementing board cultures that value conscientiousness and emphasize shareholders’ interests. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {In Europe, mainly the Mediterranean region, intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides has been recorded over the past 30 years, exceeding, in some cases, the limits of contamination authorized by the European Union. The intensive use of pollutants in fields near ecological coastal wetlands has led to implementation of pesticide monitoring programs to recover aquatic systems such as the Mondego estuary (Figueira da Foz, Portugal). According to information from the agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley, Primextra®Gold TZ is the most-used herbicide in corn crop fields. Biomarkers, such fatty acids (FAs), proved to be new and potentially powerful tools to detect, illustrate, and evaluate exposure to and the effects of contamination hazards. They play important roles in establishing neural levels in organisms' biochemical and physiological responses and are considered good bio-indicators of stress and potential indicators of ecosystem health. Bivalves are currently used in ecotoxicological bioassays because of their ecological importance, wide geographic distribution, ease of handling in the laboratory and in the field, and their ability to filter and ingest large volumes of water and sediment particles. Thus, the main goal of this work was to determine the toxic and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) responses of two size classes (small and big) of the two marine bivalve species Cerastoderma edule and Scrobicularia plana to the herbicide Primextra® Gold. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the fatty acid contents, and thus the nutritive values, of both species and size classes collected in the field with those under laboratory conditions. Results show S. plana is more sensitive to the herbicide than C. edule. In general, among the larger-sized specimens in the field, S. plana is more nutritive than C. edule, but among the smaller-sized specimens, the opposite tendency is seen, where C. edule presents a greater abundance of FAs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The grassland is the most important resource for the herdsmen in Inner Mongolia, China. In the 1980s, pastureland was administratively allocated based on household size. The subsequent changes in socioeconomic and new household characteristics suggest that adjustment is needed for more efficient land use. This study reviewed the recent progress of the rental market and investigated the herdsmen's behaviours regarding grassland market transactions in Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia. The economic assumption is that there exists a variation in values by household for each given parcel of land, which drives land transfer to users who can generate higher values. Each household is characterised by its initial pasture landholding, herding facilities and demographics. But the gain from the transfer must be deducted from the transaction costs, and cooperative membership can significantly reduce the transaction costs. An econometric model is developed and tested with data collected from household surveys in the Xilingol League. The results indicate that household size is the most significant variable for land transfer in the long run. Herdsmen have been dynamically adjusting herding equipment and pasture landholdings, allocating labour between herding and non-herding activities in response to these changes in society. Cooperative organisation was found to be significant in facilitating land transfer due to its role in reducing transaction costs. Higher quality land with higher rent is also found to be more likely to transfer since the percentage of the transaction cost is lower than lower quality land.  © Australian Rangeland Society 2017.},

The problem of research sought to understand the strategies of these leaders, called mediators, to articulate the symbolic universe of farmers, with the expectations of public policy and the circuit where the money flows. To understand this issue an empirical research was carried out in a Cooperative Credit System called Cresol. The theoretical framework that guided the analysis of the information articulated the concepts of frames (McAdam, McCarthy and Zald, 1999) and "negotiation of intimacy" (Zelizer, 2005). The conclusion is that the mediators operate its strategy of making trust and friendship (intimacy) on institutional affiliation. Its action acquires an instrumental bias in that converts economic transactions in intimacy, financial transfers in expanding and strengthening social relations and identity system. © 2017, Universidade de Brasilia.

It was developed through literature review and interviews in institutions related to certification in Brazil. Its main results indicate that: i) half of the farmers cooperatives in Brazil were certified between 2009 and 2015; ii) in a few cooperatives are concentrated the most of the coffee producers and most of the sales of fairtrade coffee; iii) Brazilian scientific research suggest that certification has contributed to the improvement of the property management and also to internationalization of the business; iv) international literature indicates advantages, but problems in the distribution of the benefits and also many where the certification’s impacts were derisory.

In contrast to the general failure one CEO, Terry Thomas stands out both for his success in co-operative rebranding and returning to profitability the UK Co-operative Bank and because he alone amongst the top echelons of the Co-operative Groups Management based his strategies on a clearly articulated philosophy based on his understanding of the values and purpose of the co-operative movement rooted in its historical traditions grounded in the writings and achievements of Robert Owen, The paper goes on to provide a case study of the bank’s process of transformation from loss-making subsidiary to the first positive co-operative national brand in the post-war period of its history. The author argues that lack of appropriate vision based on the founding values and purposes of the Co-operative Movement is the principal reason for the management’s and governance failures that have beset the UK Co-operative Group. Instead of using the past to help in understanding the present and planning for the future, the UK Co-operative Group Leadership ignored it or worse used the past successes to congratulate itself and disguise its manifest failures. In this, they were supported by an uncritical Co-operative Union (later renamed Co-operatives UK). Davis argues large co-operatives cannot be managed by a civil service responsible to an elected board. Co-operatives need a servant-leadership model of professional management dedicated to the transformational goals set by the founders of the co-operative movement. This needs a radical rethink and promotion of co-operative management education and a dedicated executive recruitment that seeks out value-based professionals whose attitudes and values are compatible with Co-operative values, ownership and purpose. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Farm subsidies have become increasingly maligned in agricultural policy debates, but the merits of subsidies are a distraction from deeper political, economic, and ecological problems in agriculture. Drawing on a history of the U.S. Farm Bill, this paper argues that a fixation on farm subsidies ignores why they came into being, and more generally glosses over the imperative for modern states to intervene into agricultural economies. Karl Polanyi's 'double movement' framework is used to situate the rise and fall of agricultural supply management within food regime theory. In the second, or surplus food regime, the U.S. government wielded excess commodities as geopolitical tools—even as domestic farm policy labored to contain overproduction, and thus support agrarian viability. In the subsequent corporate food regime, “free market” agriculture displaces and discredits supply management, even as massive government intervention into how food is grown and sold continues. Making space to remember historical price support programs, to situate their accomplishments and limitations, and to recognize residual supply-management mechanisms (such as farm cooperatives and agricultural marketing orders) is crucial for fostering agricultural viability in the US and beyond. Twentieth century supply management had flaws, but it cannot be wholly omitted. This paper highlights key motivations, elements, and contradictions of these policies and programs to begin the process of considering how supply management principles and strategies could be updated and enhanced for 21st century agriculture. Such a framework would need to pay more attention to diversity within domestic and international agricultures, and be more sensitive to the multi-scalar dimensions of food systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Although voluntary certification has recently gained importance in the agricultural industry, information asymmetry is not always completely addressed. This study analyzes how the relative proportion of boundedly rational consumers in the market influences the effectiveness of voluntary certification mechanisms by using a duopoly game model of high- and low-quality firms. The presented results show that a change in the proportion of boundedly rational consumers leads to different certification behaviors and a different market equilibrium. We also find that the existence of boundedly rational consumers is an important factor in the failure of voluntary certification. Indeed, when the relative proportion of such consumers is very high, voluntary certification is ineffective at improving market efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence, price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings: The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications: It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications: The research confirms that individual dairy farmer’s loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value: Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

According to the agency theory, banks influence the operations of SACCOS. However, empirical knowledge remains scant on the measures banks apply to control these operations and on SACCOS' governance-related reactions to bank requirements. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper explores measures used by banks to monitor and control SACCOS-partners in addition to assessing SACCOS' governance-related reactions to bank requirements. The paper utilizes data collected through in-depth interviews held with both the management of five banks selected primarily because of their active involvement in wholesale lending to SACCOS. In addition 11 SACCOS linked to these five banks were selected in Tanzania and Kenya. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. The findings reveal that measures applied by banks to monitor and control SACCOS-partners include accessing and investing in information on SACCOS-partners and their clients, and requiring both guarantees and forced savings. Compliance with these measures was found to result into two governancerelated reactions: 1) improved compliance with own by-laws, regulations, policies or procedures, and government regulations; and 2) realignment and/or reduced compliance with some of their own by-laws, policies, regulations, and procedures, and thus some of the government regulations, to accommodate bank requirements. © 2016 Practical Action Publishing.},

It focuses on the motivations of consumers to financially contribute to a cooperative by examining the risks and benefits associated with the investment. Based on a survey of 759 consumers, it links their motivations for joining a cooperative to different forms of risks and benefits associated with the investment. It shows that the risks related to cost sharing and switching costs are important determinants for consumers. Other factors that affected the likelihood of joining a cooperative were expected benefits with respect to user network externalities and infrastructure gains. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {While providing essential access for large portions of city populations, the quality of paratransit services in Sub-Saharan African cities is poor. Poor quality of service can be attributed to two features of the paratransit business operating model: driver remuneration on the basis of a daily ‘target system’; and cash-based business management in which vehicle depreciation is ignored as an operating expense. In Kenya, the voluntary organisation of fragmented inter-city matatu businesses into Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) has resulted in improved service, regulatory compliance and technology adoption, but little is known of how they operate. The aim of this paper is to gain insight into how the Kenyan inter-city matatu SACCOs are organised and have improved services, and to explore the transferability of this experience and the lessons it offers. The exploratory nature of the study, and constrained resources, necessitated that the research adopt a qualitative case study method. It was found that most of the case study SACCOs have addressed the root causes of poor service quality by shifting the remuneration of drivers from daily cash targets to salaries, and by requiring vehicle depreciation costing through compulsory contributions to the cooperative's capital savings from which vehicle acquisition and repair loans can be derived. Due to the particular shuttle-like nature of inter-city services and the considerable institutional support that exists in Kenya for cooperatives, the direct transfer of successes to other contexts is likely to prove difficult. Identifying the features of the inter-city SACCO model that have led to paratransit service improvements, and attempting to replicate these, may therefore be more effective than attempting to replicate the model in its entirety. These features are argued to be operator consolidation, accompanied by salaried drivers, systematic vehicle monitoring and compulsory vehicle depreciation costing. They can be adopted in other forms of paratransit organisation and regulation, but will require considerable adaptation to context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The paper assessed the performance of farmer’s multipurpose cooperative societies (FMCSs) in Benue State of Nigeria. Specifically the study evaluated the capacity of FMCS in delivery effective marketing services to its members and ascertains the marketing functions performed by FMCS towards effective marketing services to farmers (members) in Benue state. Data were obtained from 306 respondents who are management committees of 36 selected FMCS. Data obtained were analyzed with appropriate statistical tools. Thus, evidence from the result revealed that, the FMCS are capable of delivering various marketing services to their members. Findings also revealed that the FMCS performed various functions that facilitate marketing of their members’ farm produce as most of these marketing functions are performed to a great extent, but advertising and awareness campaigned as well as market survey and market research are not properly delivered as part of marketing functions. So in a bid to strengthen the potentials of FMCS towards effective marketing services delivery to members, the following recommendations are provided. The government should endeavor to partner with FMCS by providing them with expertise and supply them with productive resources; also the government should design a synergy between Nigeria Export Promotion Council and FMCS, so that farmers can export their produce to international market which will boost the contribution of agriculture to the GDP. Finally, the cooperative leaders should design and invest in research and market survey which will boost the competitiveness of cooperative in the competitive environment. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

This type of pollution, even though not always due to agriculture (example of the catchment of Ambleville, county 95, France where the nitrate pollution is mainly due to sewers (2012)), has been largely related to the agricultural practices (Sci Total Environ 407:6034–6043, 2009). Taking note of this observation, and instead of letting it paralyze their actions, the agricultural cooperatives decided with Agrosolutions to act directly on the field with their subscribers to change the agricultural practices impacting the water and the environment. This article shows how the French agricultural cooperatives transformed the awareness of the raw water quality problem into an opportunity for the development and implementation of more precise and responsible practices, to protect their environment.

The current Abe administration has introduced so-called Farmland Banks to facilitate land transfers to expanding farms, including general corporations, which have long been banned from farmland access in Japan. The paper argues that farmland deregulation puts the ‘incumbent’ local stakeholders of farmland governance, such as local agricultural cooperatives, local administrations, and not least farmers themselves, at risk of losing access to state support and influence. At the same time, the responsibilities for coordinating farmland consolidation have been placed onto the same local stakeholders. The state of local farmland governance has long been critical to impeding coordinated consolidation, whereas deregulation facilitates ‘predatory’ corporate farmland use. In contrast, evidence from Hikawa Town in Shimane Prefecture shows how exceptionally strong local control over farmland enables consolidation—albeit in the ‘defensive’ interests of the local incumbents. © 2016, © 2016 German Institute for Japanese Studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed new light on the issue of preference heterogeneity in cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the ideas of Habermas and Luhmann, this paper interprets preference heterogeneity of cooperative members in terms of the precarious relationship between the categories of “system” and “lifeworld.” The argument is buttressed with a case study of an agricultural cooperative recently founded in Central Greece. Findings: The sensitivity of cooperatives to the lifeworld contexts of their members exacts the price in the form of the member preference heterogeneity problem. If this sensitivity is taken to be the constitutive characteristic of cooperatives, then the proposed argument hammers home their fundamental ambivalence, as they are necessarily fraught with the potential for internal conflict. Research limitations/implications: The paper urges for a radical rethinking of Georg Draheim’s thesis of the “double nature” of cooperatives. “Double nature” is shown to aggravate the member preference heterogeneity problem. Practical implications: The results of this study inform the cooperative leaders’ quest to strike a balance between the interests of their members and the demands of the external socio-economic environment. Originality/value: This research contributes significantly to the literature on collective decision-making costs incurred by cooperatives. The failure of cooperatives to balance the sensitivity to members’ interests and to the external environment is exposed as the root cause of the divergence and heterogeneity of member preferences. This heterogeneity is shown to boost collective decision-making costs. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Food security is one of the main goals of rural poor people. To enhance food security in this context, participatory action research can help to ensure sustained success while considering entire food value chains (FVC). This paper assesses the feasibility and potential success of upgrading strategies (UPS) as well as their assessment criteria as developed by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists. The results form part of a larger participatory research project conducted in two climatically representative regions of Tanzania: semi-arid Dodoma and subhumid Morogoro. This paper presents the findings with respect to food processing, waste management and bioenergy, along with income generation and market participation. Assessments on other components of the FVC, including natural resource management, crop production and consumption, are reported by Graef et al (2015). The assessments for food processing revealed preferences for preservation techniques, oil extraction processes and food storage devices for the semi-arid region. In contrast, in the subhumid region, the experts favoured food storage devices and preservation techniques. Assessments of waste management and bioenergy UPS for both regions indicated the importance of animal feed from crop residues, crop residues as mulch and compost from food waste, although with somewhat different priorities. Assessments on income generation and markets in both regions revealed preferences for savings and credit cooperatives and communication techniques, but also indicated that warehouse receipt systems and guarantee systems had a high impact. Assessments differed between the two different climatic regions, and to some extent also between the nationality of experts and their gender. The authors therefore attach importance to integrating different South-North and female-male awareness in assessments among scientists. Moreover, local and/or regional stakeholders and experts should be involved in developing site-adapted UPS for enhancing FVCs.},

The study employs a VRIO (valuable, rare, inimitable and organizational) model for the theoretical conception of constructs related to the resource-based view and competitive advantage. A case study was undertaken in a credit union, incorporating interviews at two levels of organizational management strategic and tactical as well as a questionnaire administered with two managers to identify relevant resources and a review of secondary data consisting of company documents. The study found that only one resource may be considered a generator of sustainable competitive advantage: human capital training. This was considered by the three sources to be valuable, rare, costly to imitate and exploited by the company. Two types of physical capital resources were considered to be generators of temporary competitive advantage: financial capacity and location. These appear in at least two sources, defined as rare and valuable and expensive to copy. Therefore, the organization gains a competitive edge guided by limited resources, namely human and physical capital. These findings provide important insights for the development of further studies, systematizing the resource-based view in a research agenda. This research has implications for academics, practitioners and policy makers. Explains the strategic assets that generate competitive advantage and which are essential for the survival of the company. The realization of the value of human resources for the company studied, emphasizes the importance and necessity of ensuring the satisfaction of the people and investing in training for obtaining sustainable competitive advantage.

	abstract = {In Central‐ and Eastern Europe, the collapse of socialist regimes resulted in a transformation of state‐owned agricultural cooperatives to privately owned lands from the early 1990s onwards. These socioeconomic processes resulted in landscape‐scale changes in biodiversity, ecosystem services and agricultural production. In parallel, large‐scale abandonment of croplands, especially on sandy, salty or frequently inundated areas, became common. Abandoned croplands are usually sensitive to species invasions, and are hotspots of noxious weeds, posing threats both to agriculture and nature conservation. Grassland restoration on former croplands can be an effective strategy for suppressing these species. Thus, a common goal of nature conservation and agriculture can be the restoration of grasslands on former croplands to (1) suppress weed and/or invasive species in line with the policy “Good Farming Practices”, (2) support animal husbandry by creating meadows or pastures, and to (3) recover biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the present paper we report “best practices” of grassland restoration projects from Hungary. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of spontaneous grassland recovery vs. active grassland restoration by seed sowing in terms of the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as weed control and biomass production. Our results showed that grassland restoration on abandoned fields offers a viable solution for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services. Seed sowing ensures higher weed control and biomass production, but results in lower biodiversity compared to spontaneous recovery. Both restoration methods can be cost‐effective, or even profitable even within a relatively short period of a nature conservation project. © 2016, Copyright: © 2016 Valkó et al.},

Using focus groups, a household survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the interplay between value chain integration dimensions and value chain performance along the malt barley value chain in Ethiopia. The analyses were based on survey data sets obtained from 320 farmers and 100 traders and qualitative interview responses captured from sixty-two key informants selected from members of the chain. The structural equation modelling technique was employed to seek answer for the question of how value chain integration dimensions are related to performance. The results of the analyses showed the existence of positive relationships between coordination of activities and performance; between joint decision-making and performance at farmers-cooperatives interface; and between commitment towards long-term relationships and performance at farmers-traders interface. The study has made important empirical contributions in areas of value chain integration and performance and their interplays within the context of the studied malt barley value chain. The key findings of the study make important policy implications for agribusiness value chains in the developing countries. The study would open a venue for robust investigation based on a wider database from various agribusiness chains in Ethiopia or even beyond, for better validation of the findings. © 2016 Watabaji et al.},

Results showed a large increase in the proportion of beneficiaries accessing extension services from private service providers and expressing satisfaction with CESDM, attaining higher dairy productivity in milk and in gross margins per animal per year. However, there was only a marginal increase in willingness to pay or paying for the services and the majority of beneficiaries continued to sell milk through informal market outlets. On aggregate, CESDM posted positive net benefits and multiplicative economic power with the best performing dairy chains multiplying every shilling invested 4 to 46 times. On average, beneficiaries earned KES 4993 per farmer at a cost of KES 353 for services, inputs and equipment. We conclude that CESDM can be a viable and rewarding approach for delivering extension services to smallholder farmers but it is necessary to strengthen farmer cooperative societies because those paying for private services are still too few to sustain remunerative private sector investment in extension service delivery.},

	abstract = {Upon its triumphant return to power in 2012, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), under the leadership of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, introduced a set of new economic policies popularly called “Abenomics.” One of the main components of the new policy was a drastic reform plan for the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA), the party’s longtime loyal supporter. The announcement of the reform plan invited fierce opposition from the JA, which threatened to end its support of LDP in future elections. Why did Abe introduce the JA reform plan, even though it could lead to loss of electoral support for his party? Is he serious about carrying out the proposed reform plan, or is it just for show? This article analyzes the context of the JA reform plan from the standpoint of constructivist institutionalism focusing on policymakers’ ideas regarding party management. It claims that the LDP’s shift away from clientelism is not simply a product of electoral reform; its cause is deeply rooted in the history of the ruling party. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Some analysts report that 10 per cent or more of property/casualty insurance claims are fraudulent, while less than 20 per cent of fraudulent claims being detected. Consumer attitudes are becoming more tolerant of insurance fraud in recent years. Recognizing that not all insurance fraud situations are created equal, we investigate variability in perceptions of moral intensity in dissimilar insurance padding situations in a 2 (to help others versus to profit self) × 2 (a small credit union versus a large online insurer) model and compared the results between two independent samples (college students/Millennials and an older adult population). We also investigated the impact of ethical predispositions (formalism and utilitarianism) on moral awareness and moral judgment using these four scenarios. The results suggest that the Millennials may exhibit more situationalism and more lenient judgments of collaborative versus unilateral ethical violations. In particular, 'for self' versus 'for others' comparisons show striking differences between the two age groups. The results add to the growing literature in explaining intra-personal variability in moral decision making. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

More than half (53.2%) of the respondents had high level of awareness of the cooperative principles while 57.1% had high level of adherence to the principles. Meanwhile, inadequate financing and loan recovery difficulty (x=1.4 each) were the main constraints to adherence to the principles. There was a significant relationship between respondents' level of awareness and adherence to the cooperative principles (χ2 0.013, p ≤ 0.05). Agricultural cooperatives in the area largely adhered to the cooperatives principles. However, capacity building on innovative financial sourcing and loan recovery mechanisms should be embarked upon by management to enhance the adherence.},

This article presents a comparative modeling narrative on cooperative organizational forms' potential impact on equitable rural development. This speaks to issues of both increasing the size of the economic pie and how this income is distributed. The case is made that cooperatives can potentially generate higher rates of growth and more equitable growth, even in competitive economic environments. An important type of cooperative that is focused upon is one based on the linking of smaller farms into a cooperative. Economies of scale and scope as well in transaction costs can be captured by the cooperatives. Given cooperative governance, one would also expect higher levels of x-efficiency. Overall, cooperatives can generate relative high incomes to cooperative members, whilst remaining competitive with the traditional privately owned large farms. Critical to the success of the cooperative is a set rules and regulation that place them on a level playing field with the privately owned farm. In addition, the implementation and practice of cooperative principles are key to the success of the cooperative farm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe the extent of agricultural losses incurred by the farm households due to flood; to assess the farm households gender-based vulnerability to flood; to identify the coping strategies used by them; and to estimate factors that drive the choice of these coping strategies. Design/methodology/approach – Using both purposive and simple random sampling techniques, the paper selected 120 farm households from the flood prone areas of the state, using the list of the State Agricultural Development Project (ADP) contact farmers as a sampling frame. Data for the paper were collected using a set of structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The information collected included the extent of agricultural losses incurred by the farm households, farm household’s level of asset base, flood coping strategies adopted by the farmers and so on. The data were collected in August 2013. Findings – More than 70 per cent of the farmers’ farmlands were affected by flood, resulting in more than 80 per cent of their staple crops (cassava, rice, yam, maize and vegetables) and livestock (sheep/goat and chicken) being lost. Women were generally more vulnerable than men to the effect of flood. Selling of assets, borrowing of loans to diversify the means of livelihood, short-term migration, support from social network, compensation of losses from National and/or State Emergency Management Agencies, planting of agro-forestry trees, change of date of planting, land terracing, construction of drainages, cover cropping and making of ridges across slop constituted the flood coping strategies of the farmers. On the factors influencing the choice of these coping strategies, the level of education of the household head, frequency of extension visits in a year and tenure security status were positively and significantly related with land and crop management strategies, such as planting of agro-forestry trees, planting of cover crops and construction of drainages across farmland. Age, access to credit, farm size and membership of cooperative societies had negative relationships with selling of assets and short-term migration. In addition, membership of cooperative societies and flood experience were positively and significantly related with institutional measures, such as support from social network and National and State Emergency Management Agencies. These observations underscore the need for training, cooperatives and enhanced farm capacity (credit and farm size) in coping with flood by the farmers. It is recommended that governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should assist the farmers in these regards. Originality/value – Climate change induced flooding has become a developmental issue across the world. As countries continue to be hit by massive flooding, food production also continues to be hit adversely. Nigeria has joined this league because of the rampage flooding across the country in recent times. Anambra State is down stream of both rivers Niger and Benue and, hence, one of the states vulnerable to flooding in Nigeria. Available literature suggests that greater efforts have been made to quantify the economic implications of flooding on agriculture and the concomitant coping strategies in developed than in developing countries. This paper, therefore, assesses the extent of losses suffered by farm households, their level of vulnerability and flood coping strategies. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

There were three treatments of fertilization and the block method of experimental plot size of 600 m2 in triplicate was used in this experiment. The first treatment was unfertilized control treatment. Other treatments were fertilized by the same dose of nitrogen 240 kg*ha-1. Treatment 3 was fertilized three times during spring and treatment 2 was fertilized except 3 spring doses also in autumn. Results showed that yield of rapeseed was greatly influenced by weather conditions. Both experimental years were not equable in precipitation and temperatures. The highest average yield (at 12% moisture) 3.69 t*ha-1 was reached at treatment 3, where any autumn dose of nitrogen was not applied. It means an increase by 55.04% and 24.66% compared to unfertilized control treatment and treatment 2. Autumn dose of nitrogen did not influence significantly yield of seeds. Values of N.N.I. ranged from 0.71% to 1.25% and there were not observed any significant differences among treatments as well as between experimental years. © 2016, University of Zagreb-Faculty of Agriculture.

	abstract = {The study aimed to analyze the horizon problem in agricultural cooperatives in Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the strategies employed by the cooperatives to minimize them. This problem arises due to the temporal perspective of the cooperated be different of the cooperative organization, because the cooperative members tend to prioritize the projects and the investments that aim to benefit their economic activity in the short term. Methodologically, we chose the mixed method in the execution of search, ie, we were used qualitative and quantitative information. Thus, we sampled 10% of agricultural cooperatives linked to the Organization of Cooperatives of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (OCERGS). It was found that the cooperatives that have the "grains", as the main business activity, presented more intensity of the horizon problem. Most of the variables used to capture this problem showed elevated levels of agreement. It was also observed that the financial condition of the cooperative affects the incidence of the horizon problem. Among the main strategies to minimize this problem are: the distribution of surpluses, the programs of relationships and incentives with the membership and the return of social capital to the cooperated in the cooperative after large period. This study highlights the need to adopt new organizational models for overcoming of the horizon problem, but to achieve this strategy it is necessary to update current legislation taking into account the new environment of agribusiness. © 2015, Universidade de Taubate.

The analyses of the institutional environment were based on the New Institutional Economics, with emphasis on the Douglass North's theory (1990) about the institutions and occurred with in loco interviews in each cooperative unit that was covered by the sample. The analysis of the cultural environment was based on the characterization of the organizational culture of each cooperative unit, according to the Competing Value Model, developed by Cameron and Quinn (1998), that typifies it in group culture, innovative, market and hierarchical, applied to the same managers, through online electronic questionnaire. The analysis of the social environment was based on the theoretical concept of social capital and the respective characteristics identified in the units by adapting the model proposed by the World Bank study group (BM), prepared by Grootaert et al. (2003), through the content analysis of the interviews. As a result to the established problem it was concluded that, even C. Vale being a single cooperative, there are influences of the institutional and the socio-cultural environment in the process of management of the cooperative units in Parana and Paraguay. Finally, according to the grouping proposal of the cooperative units based on the collected data, four specific clusters were identified.},

Most women's cooperatives function by limiting their operations to small scale banking activities and enlisting men's participation in various ways. The paper concludes that the scope of empowerment of women through women's cooperatives is severely constrained by the way property rights and gender relations are structured in the state and the manner in which local male politicians have manipulated the societies for partisan ends. © 2015, © 2015 Asian Center for Women's Studies, Ewha Womans University.},

Secondary issues include analyzing the difference between technology security and information system security and examining the role that organizational insiders must play in maintaining information system security. The difficulty level is three, four, and five. This case could be used to supplement or cover an information security chapter in an undergraduate or graduate Introductory to Technology course. As part of a management curriculum, the case is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses. The case could also be used with an individual and group decision making chapter in Principles of Management, Organizational Behavior, and Organization Theory, or chapters which address the planning or controlling functions in Principles of Management. It can be taught in a single 75- minute class with two hours of student preparation outside of class in addition to time needed to read the assigned chapter. CASE SYNOPSIS Organizations face ongoing challenges to develop and maintain comprehensive systems to maintain information security. In order to do so, an understanding of both the technical and social aspects of an information system is necessary. Management must recognize the difference between information and technology security. By definition, an information system consists of (1) the environment, (2) the technology, and (3) the people. To have an adequate information system security strategy all three must be considered. The case involves an information security breach at First Freedom Credit Union. In this case, member credit card information was stolen, not by technological means but rather because of human error. The executives believed that they had adequate information system security, but were taken by surprise when their members' credit card information was stolen. The case addresses the issue of the financial services environment, the technology countermeasures that are currently in place, and the people who are using the information systems. A point is made that information is not only stored within computer-based systems, but is reproduced in the form of printed reports, backup tapes, emails, etc.},

Our analysis focuses on four Moroccan milk collection cooperatives that started using a milk analyzer with the aim of eliminating cheating by their suppliers. The cooperatives' room for maneuver in improving quality management was limited by the presence of competitors for milk collection and by the agro-industry's lack of transparency in the way its own quality controls were applied. Future studies on how producer organizations can meet the quality challenge should include the strategies of other actors in the value chain in their analyses. © 2015 European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes.},

Institutional economic theory and anecdotal historical evidence suggest that these core institutional mechanisms also had an effect on the employment structure of early credit cooperatives. By examining the employment structure of current cooperative banks, we aim to provide insights to the question of how and to what extent original institutional mechanisms of credit cooperatives may still be functional. We use administrative establishment data from Germany and compare employment structures of banks by legal form. The results indicate that cooperative banks in comparison with otherwise similar private and savings banks are characterized by more stable employment, an older workforce, more extensive training activities, and a more homogeneous composition of employees.

Design/methodology/approach: A model was developed and tested with data collected from 691 knowledge workers from 15 North American credit unions. Findings: Knowledge hiding and knowledge sharing belong to unique yet possibly overlapping constructs. Individual employees believe that they engage in knowledge hiding to a lesser degree than their co-workers. The availability of knowledge management systems and knowledge policies has no impact on intra-organizational knowledge hiding. The existence of a positive organizational knowledge culture has a negative effect on intra-organizational knowledge hiding. In contrast, job insecurity motivates knowledge hiding. Employees may reciprocate negative knowledge behavior, and knowledge hiding promotes voluntary turnover. Practical implications: Managers should realize the uniqueness of counterproductive knowledge behavior and develop proactive measures to reduce or eliminate it. Originality/value: Counterproductive knowledge behavior is dramatically under-represented in knowledge management research, and this study attempts to fill that void. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Yet in the current context of climate change, in which we turn to genetics, irrigation or innovation in cultural practices to maintain production quality, could the mountain environment emerge as a solution for adapting to climate change in vine-growing? Here we explore the role of cooperative policies that may be deployed on the territorial scale, using an agent-based model. Our model was based on the viticulture of the Banyuls-Collioures AOC area, which is characterized by small-scale vine-growers and marked by widespread involvement in cooperative systems. The simulation results showed an important role of cooperative policies not only to conserve narrow production window and required vine quality, but also in respect of the emblematic landscape structure. These results should foster vine-growers to strengthen their cooperatives and adequately use these organizations to mitigate future climate change impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cooperatives are businesses that comprise the collective economic activity of farmers through democratic structures. Its proper management enables a better access to inputs, the application of advanced techniques of agronomy and makes a profitable marketing possible. Globalization and the increasing asymmetry in the markets call for a modernization of cooperatives. Thus, to ensure their survival it is essential to address the challenge of globalization and market orientation. This paper establishes a typology of cooperative exporters based on a sample of 45 Spanish citrus cooperatives and analyses the existence of significant differences between them based on their knowledge of markets, market orientation and innovation. The results show that there are differences in knowledge of markets among those cooperatives that export through second grade cooperatives and those who export directly. Additionally, differences were also significant in innovation and market orientation among cooperatives that exported sporadically and those with an export plan. © 2016, Universidad del Zulia.

The objective of this research is to address an emerging problem seen in the business model of agricultural cooperatives. These vertically expanded farmer associations market their products jointly. However, within the cooperatives farmers remain competitors seeking their own best interest, simultaneously seeking contracts for the most profitable crops in the most desirable part of the season; this behavior can work to the detriment of the group. The model developed considers the problem of asymmetric information and internal competition within the cooperative, as well as traditional factors relevant to agricultural planning. Thereafter, an auction based coordination mechanism is formulated, which leads production decisions toward a coordinated outcome despite each individual acting independently and on his/her best interest. The mechanism is shown to approximate optimal production targets through focused information discovery and a well-structured contract allocation methodology. The results presented show the viability of implementing such planning scheme in practice as well as the optimality gap under a variety of settings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: This article examines the program of agricultural cooperative (JA) reform initiated by the Abe administration in November 2013 and ending with draft legislation approved by the Diet in August 2015 for enactment in April 2016. The government linked JA reform to its broader program of economic reform in several ways: as an important item on the agenda of regulatory reform; as a ‘trump card’ in the transformation of agriculture into a growth industry; and as a means to strengthen the international competitiveness of the domestic farm industry in order to facilitate further opening of Japan’s agricultural market. The Abe administration also had an additional, political objective in accomplishing JA reform – to weaken the political power of JA as one of the country’s most formidable and influential pressure groups. This article evaluates the nature of the reform program and its success in achieving its wider economic and political objectives. It argues that the reforms to date are both radical and limited. They are radical because they are unprecedented; on the other hand, they are limited because the extent of the change is relatively circumscribed and therefore its potential to achieve the government’s broader economic goals as well as its narrower sectoral goals is relatively modest. © 2016 Japanese Studies Association of Australia.},

Responding to the economic crisis, the companies cut off investments, wages and reduced personnel. However, the companies have to adapt their business strategies to cope with the crisis. This paper conducts a strategic assessment of the Greek agricultural cooperatives during the first half of 2013 using in-dep interviews withcooperative executives in order to illustrate how they have responded to the crisis and also to investigate their strategic options for the upcoming period. The results of the analysis show that agricultural cooperatives have chosen the retrenchment and cost-cutting strategies by restraining their activities while they appear eager to export their production. In addition, the cash shortage forced them to count exclusively on their members to finance any new economic activity. According to the cooperatives’ executives, their adaption strategies exclude abandoning the activities and selling the equipment and their real estate properties, while they involve exports, the experienced personnel and marketing investments. These results could provide helpful directions not only for the agricultural cooperatives’ management boards but also for the food industry businesses operating under a severe economic situation such as the present Greek economic crisis. © 2016, Agricultural Economics.

The study is informed by cross-disciplinary literature in rural development, specifically, multi-functional agriculture and nested markets. Results show a complex, dynamic terrain where new strategies are emerging within an agricultural sector struggling to survive global free trade policies and neoliberalism. Here, rural tourism is neither a simple, business-orientated project nor a step-by-step process of tourism “development”. It emerges, together with nested markets, in the rural agricultural domain. Farmers, residents and newcomers draw upon historical practices and cultural knowledge to create innovative, quality products and educational experiences that contribute to the sustainability of local agricultural livelihoods and cultural traditions. However, shifts in public sector roles and structural changes in the growth and power of the agriculture cooperatives exacerbate the tensions and conflicts evident within the community in this struggle for rural survival. The study offers possibilities for new forms of “local tourism experience” and nested markets that can contribute to sustainable rural development, and has links to universal key issues of empowerment, control, understanding, markets and product development in rural tourism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of name change, if any on the financial performance of deposit-taking savings and credit co-operatives (SACCOs) in a developing country characterized by a vibrant SACCO sector. Sparse studies exist on the impact of name changes on revenue-cost performance in mutual financial institutions such as SACCOs. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a standard event methodology over a six-year period (2008-2013) to investigate the impact of name change on the return on assets (ROA) and operating profit margin (OPM). The study then uses a panel regression method to study the impact of name change on ROA and OPM for a sample of 212 deposit-taking SACCOs over the period 2008-2013. Findings: The results, which are robust for a variety of controls, provide evidence in support of a consistent positive association between name change and subsequent financial performance of deposit-taking SACCOs in Kenya. The positive impact of name change seems to be experienced about four years after the name change. The results reveal muted influence of regulation on name change and financial performance of SACCOs in Kenya. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses solely on deposit-taking SACCOs in a developing country context over a six-year period only. Extending the time period and including a sample of control SACCOs operating purely back-office service activities would add power to the analyses. Practical implications: The current study illustrates the contribution of name change on the financial performance of SACCOs in a developing country characterized by a vibrant SACCO sector. Overall, the results show that name change announcements signal an improvement in SACCOs’ future prospects. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the contribution of name change announcements on the financial performance of SACCOs in a developing country context. The study adds to the sparse literature on the impact of name change on the financial performance of mutual financial institutions that are not listed on the securities exchange. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

I find symptoms of synergy effects from potential collaboration between different cooperative banks. Conversely, stronger competition from credit unions, which, until recently, remained outside the official supervisory system and had poor loan portfolios, corresponds with cooperative banks' worsened loan portfolio quality and performance. The results allow for the conjecture that leaving shadow banks outside the supervisory system may create unwanted competition and may negatively influence the stability of the banking sector. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The aim of this paper is to interpret the concept of a business model from the pattern of coordination mechanisms used by an Italian wine cooperative to manage its inter-organizational relationships. Design/methodology/approach – The business model is taken as the structure and governance of the relationships between the focal firm and its exchange partners. The empirical analysis is based on a qualitative investigation, analyzing material collected at the Farming Cooperative Gran Cru. Findings – Several different coordination mechanisms were used to rethink the firm customer value proposition, showing a very complex and dynamic inter-organizational system: Process control mechanisms, knowledge suppliers and clan control mechanisms. The combination of mechanisms enables the firm to govern the extreme complexity of external complementarities and interdependence among activities and resources. Practical implications – The study is particularly helpful to managers because wine entrepreneurs and managers can influence their networks’ features and strategies, as well as the mechanisms for governance of the relationships and extracting customer value. Originality/value – The study seeks to enrich the debate on the strategy/structure fit by shifting the focus from the organizational to inter-organizational level of analysis. The analysis centers on boundary-spanning relationships between one wine firm and its partners and knowledge suppliers. This perspective brings business model analysis and inter-organizational design closer because variables of the business model – such as customer value – can be seen as combinations of inter-organizational coordination mechanisms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Encased in this scenario, knowledge management has become a topic of discussion since the society of knowledge, intellectual capital and the ability to generate knowledge, are necessary ingredients for competitiveness. Credit unions have become an important tool for social inclusion and strong mechanism of income distribution, mainly in the Amazon region. The aim of the study was to analyze the practices of Knowledge Management in Credit Cooperatives of the states of Rondônia, Acre and Amazonas. This is a quantitative descriptive in nature, using the technique Survey to collect data. The data collection instrument consisted of 30 closed questions were used Likert scales five points, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”, drawn from the model of knowledge management proposed by Terra (2001) Data were collected electronically through LimeSurvey, and the research was directed cooperatives affiliated to the system and SICOOB, CREDISIS, and the data were statistically analyzed with the software R. The results show that the cooperative has advanced gradually in the field of knowledge management. As a conclusion, it is believed that cooperatives, as well as knowledge management are still issues in recent Brazilian history and in academia, especially in the Amazon region therefore require the expansion of research and investment. © 2016, Universidade de Taubate.

Further, our model predicts that a cooperative firm is less prone to monitor-manager collusion, and that it monitors excessively in high-return environments. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The value of membership of an agricultural producer cooperative to a farmer is universally understood to include market access, improved bargaining power, and reduced transaction costs. As a result of consolidation in agriculture, many farmers in developed countries have found themselves in complex cooperative structures in which market orientation may elevate capital-related membership benefits over the traditional patronage and farming-related benefits. This study utilized the heterogeneity in producer organization structures to examine the significance to farmers of membership in modern agricultural cooperatives. Survey data including 682 Finnish agricultural producers in the livestock sector enabled the subjective value of cooperative membership and the relationship with transaction cost benefits to be analyzed. The effect of vertical integration in cooperatives on the self-reported value of membership benefits was assessed with a sample consisting of members in three types of cooperative organizations: dairy marketing, dairy supply, and meat cooperatives. The findings confirm that a stable market channel is still the most important benefit that producers perceive as deriving from cooperative membership. Multivariate ordered probit analysis indicated that the market channel is equally appreciated by large and small producers, but the reduced uncertainty brought by a cooperative buyer is particularly valuable to farmers who are investing in farm expansion. The survey findings indicate that the more competition for the raw material from producers there is in an area, the greater is the pressure cooperatives may be under to develop their service offering in order to attract members. © 2015, Alh.},

Multi stage sampling technique was adopted in sample selection. Data were collected with use of questionnaire and interview schedule. The sample size was 150 fish farmers randomly selected from a list of 1500 registered ICT user fish farmers obtained from fish farmers cooperative office in Andoni, headquarters of Zone II. Data were analyzed using descriptive tools such as percentages, presented in tabular forms. Majority, (43.3%) were 41-50 years with a mean age of 42.5 years, 91.3% were males, 76% were married, 63.3% had a family size of 1-4 people. Majority (56%) had secondary education, 50.6% had between 21-30 years in fishing experience. ICT devices used includes mobile phones, radio, television, internet, journals and magazines among. Fish farmers needed information on pond construction, sources of fingerlings, sales and marketing, diseases treatment, weather/temperature an many more. ICTs play the following roles in fish farming: information exchange, knowledge sharing, promotion of education, monitoring illegal fishing and price information provisioning. The challenges facing them includes high cost of device, low level of education, power supply, network problem among others. It was recommended that education and training be given to the farmers by the extension agents, power supply and network services should be improved the various bodies responsible for the services.},

Consumer co-operatives in South Korea have been rapidly growing during the last decade. There are two leading theories in finance that explain capital structure: the trade-off and pecking order theories. Focusing on consumer co-operatives in South Korea, the paper aims to analyze empirically what determinants have effect on the capital structure of consumer co-operatives and which of the two theories is more plausible. This study reveals that profitability and firm size have a significantly negative effect on leverage while tangibility and growth have a significantly positive effect on it. In conclusion, it seems that neither of the theories above perfectly accounts for the capital structure of consumer co-operatives because of the differences in governance characteristics between consumer co-operatives and IOB as well as in the costs of bankruptcy, agency, informational asymmetry and securities issuance.

	abstract = {The recognition of family farms and agricultural cooperatives as catalysts for agricultural recovery during the perestroika years went along with the rediscovery of the world-famous theoretician of the peasant farm Aleksandr V. Chaianov. The economist’s rehabilitation resulted from the changing conventions of public discourse towards the end of the Soviet era. Yet, Chaianov’s return needs to be linked also with the official image of the rural economy in the preceding decade when in academic and political debates on private subsidiary farms the socialist village took on new contours. Household farming which had previously been condemned as either a ‘petty-bourgeois’ mode of production or an indicator of the incomplete transition to socialism, was accepted as a component of socialist agriculture. Mirroring a new understanding of socialism, this paradigm shift was an important precondition for the broad public response to Chaianov’s rehabilitation. In the end, the turn towards family farming and co-operation remained an intellectual and political phenomenon with barely any impact on the agrarian order itself. The economic legacy of the Soviet era and local power constellations prevented a fundamental change of the rural order in favor of household-based agriculture. © 2021 Institut National de Recherche Pedagogique.

Here we asked whether domestic dogs evaluate humans interacting with one another over neutral objects. In two experimental conditions, the dog's owner tried to open a container to get a junk object that was inside, then requested help from an actor sitting next to her/him, while the dog watched the interaction. In the Helper condition, the actor held the container stable to help the owner to open it. In the Nonhelper condition, the actor turned away and refused to help. In the Control condition, the actor simply turned away in the absence of any request for help. A neutral person sat at the other side of the owner throughout these interactions. After the interaction the actor and the neutral person each offered a piece of food to the dog. Dogs chose food randomly in the Helper and the Control conditions, but were biased against the actor in the Nonhelper condition. The dogs' avoidance of someone who behaved negatively to the owner suggests that social eavesdropping may be shared with a nonprimate species. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Therefore, more work needs to be done to understand the social attributes that transform members into active members. In this paper the incentives that sustain members' participation over time and the contribution of members' active participation in the cooperative's competitive advantage are studied. Empirical evidence is provided via a questionnaire completed by 241 cooperative members of a Dutch feed supply cooperative and interviews with cooperative experts. Results show that active membership builds on social attributes, such as cooperative culture, open communication, trust, involvement, and the willingness to be active. It is explained that these social attributes create benefits for both the cooperative and its members. Finally, suggestions are presented to stimulate active cooperative membership.},

This paper draws on a case study of organic rice farming in Hongdong District, South Korea, and provides insights into communitarian cooperative organic farming, a collective organic farming model. Various organic farming practices (e.g. integrated rice-duck farming) have been collectively adopted by small-scale rice farmers in Hongdong since 1994. Organic rice farming in Hongdong is characterised by place-based cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, and strong community leadership. Hongdong has demonstrated that communitarianism and smallholder cooperatives can work for each other complementarily and therefore that communitarian organic farming through smallholder cooperatives is highly operational. The Hongdong organic farming model is of great relevance to other parts of rice-growing Asia, which are dominated by smallholding farmers, in terms of the twin goals of food security and food safety. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using survey data of 421 women members and 210 nonmembers of a coffee producer cooperative in Western Uganda, this study investigates the determinants of women's participation in cooperatives and women's intensity of participation. The results highlight the importance of access to and control over land for women to join the cooperative in the first place. Participation intensity is measured through women's participation in collective coffee marketing and share capital contributions. It is found that duration of membership, access to extension services, more equal intrahousehold power relations, and joint land ownership positively influence women's ability to commit to collective action. These findings demonstrate the embeddedness of collective action in gender relations and the positive value of women's active participation for agricultural-marketing cooperatives. © 2015 IAFFE.},

This article discusses one such experiment that women's savings and credit cooperatives in Nepal have undertaken to mediate conflict and build peace at the local levels. Using women's narratives emerging from interviews and focus group discussions, the gendered assumptions behind women's community-based peacebuilding activities, and implications for women's sustained participation in peace work, are examined. The findings reveal that this model of peacebuilding relied on educating and training women but neglected to explore the structural inequalities that cause violence. Indeed, the expectation placed on women's savings and credit co-operative members to perform unremunerated and sustained peace work in their communities may itself reflect inequalities of power that community-based peace models need to address. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2015 All rights reserved.},

Due to climate change and policy fragmentation household food security and nutrition remain a perpetual challenge, especially for women eking out a living on the periphery. One of the premises that this paper is based on is the assumption that women are prime producers of their communities’ food, which is mainly for food security. Inqolobane Yobumbano Secondary Co-operative (IYSC) could be seen as an initiative that entrenches this role, adding to the burden of women’s care work and ‘subordination’. Contradictorily, the initiative offers women the opportunity to transform this role, empowering them and enabling them to take control of their lives in many ways. Issues pertaining to food security and insecurity are intertwined with women’s struggle for land, which mirrors the unfinished business in post-apartheid South Africa. The case of IYSC is used to interrogate opportunities and challenges besetting the efforts of mainly women in Inanda township. The Secondary Co-Operative is an apex co-operative body formed in 2013 and it has four primary co-operatives. This association was formed with the primary purpose of improving the functioning of agricultural co-operatives within the Inanda area in dealing with food insecurity, poverty, unemployment and inequality. © 2017 Ndwakhulu Tshishonga.},

The main aim of this paper is to analyze the development of the capital structure and capital disparity across the farmers' cooperatives from fourteen regions of the Czech Republic for time series 2009 - 2013. For this analysis is used the debt leverage indicators and method of comparative statics. Data are obtained and processed from the database of enterprises of Albertina. The financial and economic crisis lowered the debt to equity ratio and debt to assets ratio and the profitability ratios as well and the indicators reports V-shaped trend. The disparity of the ratio values among regions at the end of the monitored period seems not to be changed. Usually Prague as the region with the highest GDP per capita during the monitored period reports usually the extreme values in most ratios and higher deviations in debt ratios and lower deviations in profitability ratios. Also the impact of capital structure indicators on the profitability of cooperatives seems to be not significant during the monitored period.},

Nevertheless co-operative performance is affected by pervasive incentive problems. CUMA history suggests how social capital is a critical resource in overcoming some incentive problems. The CUMAs succeeded in creating effective co-operatives through the development of a dense fabric of relations: (i) among the family farmers' members within their local co-operatives; (ii) between the local co-operatives; and (iii) through their network with a multiplicity of actors. Some lessons from this cooperative experience can be broadly useful to governments and development practitioners to help unlock the family farming potential in developing countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The application of a maturity model to 15 credit unions in North America revealed that an overall level of KM maturity is at an early stage of development, but there are signs of future improvement. Credit unions operate in a highly competitive, knowledge-intensive financial industry and experience various pressures to increase their efficiency, which they can achieve through the implementation of KM solutions. Despite the absence of official KM strategies, KM projects were introduced locally in order to fill particular knowledge gaps. The availability of IT infrastructure and the implementation of KM-related technologies alone are insufficient to ensure universal success of organizational KM activities. Credit union managers periodically access and use academic research in their decision making. At the same time, they prefer accessing scholarly knowledge in translated form from books, practitioner magazines, and consultants. It was concluded that organizations competing in the knowledge-intensive sector have an inner need for KM solutions. © 20162015 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work aims at providing a framework for the analysis of governance in networks of cooperative firms. It builds on four bodies of literature: cooperation, transaction costs, monopoly capitalism, production networks. The framework associates the specific principles that define the identity of cooperative organizations (self-help, member ownership, democratic control, financial participation, limited capital remuneration) alongside more general governance levels (embodied values, property rights, control, resource allocation). We then apply the same dimensions to production networks and propose a stylized networking model for cooperatives. We introduce market power, and identify two polarized types of networks: (1) heterarchical forms of coordination based on cooperation and mutual help, (2) hierarchical coordination based on exclusive direction. We compare both types with our normative framework providing examples and brief case studies for each network type. Recommendations to scholars and practitioners point at the opportunity to discriminate inter-firm relations and production development strategy in terms of the values of cooperation, at all governance levels. Die erweiterte Governance von genossenschaftlichen Unternehmen: Koordination zwischen den Unternehmen und Übereinstimmung der Werte: Mit diesem Beitrag wird bezweckt, einen Rahmen für die Analyse der Governance in Netzwerken genossenschaftlicher Unternehmen zu schaffen. Die Arbeit basiert auf vier Literaturbereichen: Genossenschaftswesen, Transaktionskosten, Monopolkapitalismus und Produktionsnetzwerke. Der von uns entwickelte Rahmen verbindet die spezifischen Prinzipien miteinander, die, neben allgemeineren Governance-Kategorien (verkörperte Werte, Eigentumsrechte, Kontrolle, Ressourcenallokation), die Identität genossenschaftlicher Organisationen definieren (Selbsthilfe, Unternehmen im Eigentum der Mitglieder, demokratische Kontrolle, finanzielle Beteiligung, begrenzte Kapitalrendite). Sodann wenden wir dieselben Kriterien auf Produktionsnetzwerke an und schlagen ein stilisiertes Netzwerkmodell für Genossenschaften vor. Anschließend führen wir das Phänomen der Marktmacht ein und identifizieren zwei Extrempositionen von Netzwerktypen: (1) "heterarchische" Koordinationsformen, die auf Kooperation und gegenseitiger Hilfe basieren, und (2) hierarchische Koordination, die auf exklusiver Anweisungsbefugnis basiert. Wir vergleichen beide Typen mit unserem normativen Rahmen, wobei wir für jeden Netzwerktyp Beispiele und kurze Fallstudien bringen. Unsere Empfehlungen an Wissenschaftler und Praktiker zeigen die Möglichkeit auf, bei den Beziehungen zwischen den Unternehmen und bei den Produktionsentwicklungsstrategien eine Unterscheidung in Bezug auf die genossenschaftlichen Werte vorzunehmen, und die, für jegliche Governance-Kategorie. La gobernanza de las empresas cooperativas: la coordinación entre empresas y la coherencia de los valores: Este trabajo trata de proporcionar un marco para el análisis de la gobernanza de redes de empresas cooperativas. Se basa sobre cuatro pilares de la literatura: la cooperación, los costes de transacción, el capitalismo monopolístico y las redes de producción. Los autores asocian a estas dimensiones los principios específicos que definen la identidad de las organizaciones cooperativas (autoasistencia, propiedad de los miembros, control democrático, participación financiera y remuneración limitada del capital), al mismo tiempo que niveles de gobernanza mas general (valores incorporados, derechos de propiedad, control y asignación de recursos). Los autores aplican entonces las mismas dimensiones a las redes de producción y proponen un modelo para las cooperativas. A continuación presentan el poder de mercado e identifican dos tipos polarizados de redes: (1) formas heterogéneas de coordinación basadas en la cooperación y en la ayuda mutua, (2) coordinación jerárquica basada en la dirección exclusiva. Se comparan estos dos tipos con el marco normativo de referencia, proporcionando ejemplos y breves estudios del caso para cada tipo de red. Las recomendaciones a los especialistas y a los expertos muestran la oportunidad de hacer distinciones en las relaciones entre las empresas y la elaboración de una estrategia de desarrollo de la producción en términos de valores de cooperación a todos los niveles de gobernanza.

Il se base sur quatre piliers de la littérature: la coopération, les coûts de transaction, le capitalisme monopolistique et les réseaux de production. Ils associent à ces dimensions les principes spécifiques qui définissent l'identité des organisations coopératives (auto-assistance, propriété des membres, contrôle démocratique, participation financière, rémunération limitée du capital) en même temps que des niveaux de gouvernance plus générale (valeurs incorporées, droits de propriété, contrôle, allocation des ressources). Les auteurs appliquent alors les mêmes dimensions aux réseaux de production et proposent un modèle stylisé de réseautage pour les coopératives.

Among various revolutions country has come across, there is a prominence for the industrial revolution for bringing power loom sector and mill sector in place, however this development on one hand has led to the downfall of the handloom fabric industry. Following agriculture, handloom is the second largest sector in terms of employment, as it provides direct and indirect employment for about 43 lakh weavers and associated employees. This sector contributes nearby 15percent of the cloth production in the country. Handloom industry is very powerful in terms of exclusivity, production flexibility, scope of novelty and modernization, meeting the requirement of the suppliers promptly and such wealthy prospects in weaving tradition (Ministry of Textiles 2015).

	abstract = {There are more than one million agricultural cooperatives members in Iran. In the meantime, the rapid development of the animal husbandry in Iran has forced cooperatives to meet the members’ scientific and practical needs for completing production cycle of the dairy industry. Livestock production covers a wide spectrum of livestock activities including bee keeping, silkworm raising, and aquaculture, indicating widespread business systems in Iranian animal husbandry. Due to significant livestock population, various animal products, such as raw milk, red meat, white meat (chicken and fish), eggs, and honey are produced. Thus, the mentioned cooperatives need to meet the markets demands for keeping competitive advantage more than any time before. Only when innovation is fostered, market competitive advantage can be maintained. Today, sustainability and innovation issues have a great importance in some organizations such as agriculture cooperatives. The term “entrepreneurship” is coined to describe this need to keep organizations in competitive situation by innovations tools. Presently, it is believed that entrepreneurship can be developed. Organizational, personal, and environmental aspects are important factors toward entrepreneurship fostering. This study took into consideration three factors in cooperatives, including structure, strategy, and leadership.The results of research revealed that these three variables play important role in entrepreneurship development in cooperatives. Thus, consideration of these aspects can help in development and boost cooperatives profits. The result of modeling by structural equations methods showed that 38% of the variance of entrepreneurship as a dependent variable could be explained by these three factors in cooperatives. © 2015 Tarbiat Modares University.

Considering that SACCOs in Kenya lack the necessary resources to acquire the best information systems, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate MISs currently in use in the SACCO subsector to determine how well they are serving. Design/methodology/approach: Using the ISO/EC 25010 Software Product Quality Model, the quality of MISs operated by 215 Deposit-Taking SACCOs in the Kenya was evaluated to determine their level of performance. Findings: The results indicated that the MISs currently in use by the SACCOs serve them well in terms of functionality, efficiency, reliability, ease of use and portability. However, vendor support, technical training and implementation process are a big concern to the SACCOs. Practical implications: The SACCOs in Kenya need not look for other MISs as the ones in use satisfied the condition required by the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Product Quality Model. The areas that require attention are vendor support services by entering into contracts technical training and service level agreement; and good project management in software implementation. Originality/value: The research addresses itself to one of the biggest setbacks faced by a fast growing subsector in adopting ICT with limited capacity and infrastructure. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach – Data collection occurred in 26 states and the Federal District of Brazil. There was validation of 171 questionnaires answered at the strategic and tactical levels in the context of cooperatives in 13 sectors of Brazil’s economy. Structural equation modeling was used as an application to verify the data with the use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings – The results made it possible to verify the relationship between SMC and the social and environmental performance. The coefficient found for the relationship between SMC and economicfinancial performance also had a positive effect. Practical implications – The research results provide evidence that SMC is directly related to the economic-financial and socialenvironmental performance of cooperative organizations. SMC may also contribute to the analytical process of organizations from the statistical dimension and an applied empirical structure. Originality/value – The model reached support in both relationships with significant values, demonstrating that the dimensions and scales used to measure it were satisfactory, validating the proposed model. This finding demonstrates that these organizations have the skills to meet the requirements of and manage stakeholders, even if one person plays different roles, i.e. the cooperative member, which is basically the owner, supplier, consumer and customer. © FECAP.},

The statistical results indicate that cooperative members who have large families or are dissatisfied with the financial management of the UGPPM do not pay irrigation fees; whereas female and elderly cooperative members, and those who perceive the UGPPM decision-making process as autocratic, do not regularly participate in collective maintenance activities. The socio-cultural homogeneity of the UGPPM sustains the flexibility of rules and facilitates free riding. © 2015 European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes.},

Secondary issues include analyzing the difference between technology security and information system security and examining the role that organizational insiders must play in maintaining information system security. The difficulty level is three, four, and five. This case could be used to supplement or cover an information system security chapter in an undergraduate or graduate Introductory to Technology course. As part of a management curriculum, the case is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses. The case could also be used with an individual and group decision making chapter in Principles of Management, Organizational Behavior, and Organization Theory, or chapters which address the planning or controlling functions in Principles of Management. It can be taught in a single 75- minute class with two hours of student preparation outside of class in addition to time needed to read the assigned chapter. Case Synopsis: Organizations face ongoing challenges to develop and maintain comprehensive systems to maintain information security. In order to do so, an understanding of both the technical and social aspects of an information system is necessary. Management must recognize the difference between information and technology security. By definition, an information system consists of (1) the environment, (2) the technology, and (3) the people. To have an adequate information system security strategy all three must be considered. The case involves an information system security breach at First Freedom Credit Union. In this case, member credit card information was stolen, not by technological means but rather because of human error. The executives believed that they had adequate information system security, but were taken by surprise when their members' credit card information was stolen. The case addresses the issue of the financial services environment, the technology countermeasures that are currently in place, and the people who are using the information systems. A point is made that information is not only stored within computer-based systems, but is reproduced in the form of printed reports, backup tapes, emails, etc.},

The model provides a wider comprehension of the CR concept and introduces both the drivers and consequences. Research limitation – This investigation is based on a sample of members of one union of co-operatives in the specific dairy milk industry. Practical implication – The results give new guidelines to redress the co-operatives traditional management, namely the management of intangible assets like reputation. Internal culture, satisfaction with management, image and communication can boost reputation and thus organizational performance and members’ loyalty.

Three types of stores are found within Eroski: 1) cooperatives with significant employee ownership and voice; 2) cooperatives with modest employee ownership and limited voice (known as GESPAs); and 3) conventional stores with no employee ownership. Key data are monthly observations - 9,800 for supermarkets and 2,150 for hypermarkets (large superstores combining supermarkets and department stores). By estimating first-difference models, the authors find that hypermarket stores with cooperative ownership have significantly faster sales growth than do GESPA stores. For supermarkets overall, they find no significant differences in performance among the three types of stores. For a subgroup of small supermarkets, however, cooperatives outperform conventional stores. To investigate the mechanisms that help explain why cooperatives perform better, the authors provide additional evidence that takes into account the more extensive opportunities for employee involvement, training, and stronger economic incentives in cooperatives. While cooperative members are better paid than peers in comparable firms, individual data show that job satisfaction is lower for cooperative workers than for GESPA workers. Though this may reflect higher worker expectations in cooperatives, alternatively cooperatives may constitute a "high-stress work system." © The Author(s) 2014},

Special attention is paid to community-based organic agriculture as a pathway to rural development. The Philippines has two decades of experience of community-based natural resource management. Unlike public natural resources such as forests, watersheds or fisheries, however, the community-based organic agriculture programme is intended to deal with the private property regime. Thus, if the programme is to be successful, agrarian land reform must continue. Integrated rice- duck farming is among the suitable and viable options for organic agriculture, given that rice is a major agricultural crop and duck meat is popular in the Philippines. Area-based organic food certification systems need to be formulated and a government-farmers partnership should be forged to facilitate farmers' access to domestic and international organic food markets.},

Common and different features of principles of credit cooperative formation in Europe, USA, Latin America, and Asian-Pacific region are viewed. Experience of development of agricultural credit cooperation of Russia and its involvement in international cooperation programs are studied. As a research method, systemic approach to study of historical experience of organization of agricultural credit cooperation, as well as comparative, structural, and functional analysis, was used. It was determined that systems of agricultural credit cooperation, which develop in a sustainable manner, showed extraordinary feasibility in various manifestations of economic crises due to them being built on the basis of existing horizontal ties of shareholders and formation of effective management system, built on practical implementation of principles of ethical economy. Appearance and aggravation of internal contradictions in the system of agricultural credit cooperation are viewed. The authors come to the conclusion that these contradictions have deeper basis than peculiarities of national economy and are connected to differences between principal theoretical preconditions of emergence and development of credit cooperation. Various interests which lie in the basis of emergence of specific cooperative associations come to the surface of economic reality as initial factors, which, in the process of development, show their contradiction to general tendencies of development of national economy, tendencies in the global division of labor, and global competition in conquering markets for sales of agricultural products.},

This created new market income opportunities for dairy processors, but also fostered the necessity for investments to access these markets. A literature review sees cooperatives to be disadvantaged at this point, because their organisational structure hinders their access to external financial resources. Confronted with these equity constraints, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how German dairy marketing cooperatives adapted to the new business environment and have been performing from 2000 to 2012. Design/methodology/approach – An approach combining descriptive data from public sources and financial ratio analysis was used to test hypotheses, derived from Transaction Cost Theory. Findings – Contrary to assumptions, cooperatives gained market shares on the German dairy market. However, dairy cooperatives managed to overcome the internal equity constraints only partially via mergers, which intensified structural change. Focusing on cost leadership, German cooperatives were not able to successfully diversify their product portfolio and still operate mainly in the fluid, low margins dairy market segments. Frustrated by their diminishing influence on the decision making process in the vastly grown cooperatives, a majority of farmers cancelled their cooperative membership. Practical implications – Until today an absolute turning point for the cooperative organisational form has not yet occurred, but if cooperatives do not find the means to invest more heavily in the new markets, a slow decline of cooperatives is expected. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the existing literature on marketing cooperatives by providing insights on the performance of cooperatives through combination of from theory derived assumptions with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe an equity management and planning tool used by rural electric cooperatives (RECs) and based on the times-interest-earned ratio (TIER). The objectives of the paper are to construct a mathematical model that provides a rigorous foundation for the TIER approach, modify the approach so the rate of return on equity is a function of the cooperative’s equity position, demonstrate how elements of the model can be used by RECs in setting electric rates that will enable them to accelerate the retirement of member equity, and derive a generalized form of the “modified Goodwin formula” that can be used by both RECs and agricultural cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach – Mathematical and graphical expressions of the TIER approach are developed. Simulations are used to demonstrate how RECs can set electric rates according to a target revolving period. The modified Goodwin formula is generalized to include the payment of cash patronage refunds through use of a growth model of an agricultural cooperative developed in Royer (1993). Findings – This paper demonstrates how TIER analysis and the modified Goodwin formula can be used by cooperatives to aid their decisions regarding debt and equity financing and their choices regarding cash patronage refunds, equity retirement, and growth. The paper demonstrates that cooperatives that fail to recognize the functional relationship between the rate of return on equity and the equity position may substantially underestimate the equity position necessary to meet interest coverage requirements and overestimate their ability to grow and retire equity. It also shows that RECs may be able to make substantial improvements in equity revolvement with only modest increases in electric rates. Research limitations/implications – The model developed in this paper has been simplified to focus on fundamental financial relationships. To apply this model, cooperatives may need to modify it to accommodate the complexities of their business operations. Practical implications – TIER analysis can provide a useful equity management and planning tool for both RECs and agricultural cooperatives. It also can be used by lending institutions to assess the financial health of individual cooperative organizations. Originality/value – Constructing a mathematical model that provides a foundation for TIER analysis, modifying the approach so that the rate of return on equity is a function of the equity position, demonstrating how RECs can use the model to set electric rates according to a target revolving period, and generalizing the modified Goodwin formula so it can be used by agricultural cooperatives are all original contributions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Based on data from 412 households, this study used the sustainable livelihoods approach to analyse changes in livelihood strategies and the relationship between those changes and rural household attitudes in an eastern coastal region of China. Focussing on household off-farm employment decisions and land transfer decisions, we classified the households into six types based on their livelihood strategies, namely, off-farm employment-oriented, balanced, off-farm, idle, professional, and conventional. The survey results indicate that two capital factors, age and education, and two mediating factors, wage and crop prices, are important influences of off-farm employment decisions, whereas factors such as policies and subsidies, machinery, activities organized by local agricultural cooperatives, and land rent substantially influence land transfer decisions. By analysing the characteristics, trends and driving factors of livelihood transitions, i.e., changes in rural household livelihood strategies, from 1993 to 2013, we explored the mechanisms of livelihood transitions. The results indicate that the proportion of conventional households decreased and the proportion of off-farm employment-oriented households and off-farm households increased. Agricultural production transformed from a system of scattered households (conventional and off-farm employment-oriented households) into broad-scale management households (professional and balanced households). These changes were the main characteristics of livelihood transitions under rapid industrialization combined with rapid urbanization in the Qingpu district. Rural livelihood transitions exhibited a stepped pattern, going through an initial stage, a self-organizing stage, and a government-led stage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to investigate the effect of cooperative societies on household food security in six villages of Northern Ethiopia. Cooperative societies have significant contribution to the food security and poverty reduction. However, limited empirical studies exist in the study areas about the roles of cooperative societies on food security. Design/methodology/approach – Primary cross-sectional data were collected from randomly selected 400 households. The study also gathered secondary data from the cooperative associations and government offices for comparison purposes. The paper applied Heckman two-stage model to capture the effect of cooperative societies on household food security. Findings – The probability of the households to join cooperative societies and also ensure food security depends on various determining factors like institutional factors, demographic variables and rural functions. The paired sample t-test shows that the mean income and expenditure of the cooperative member households were 70 and 40 per cent higher in 2010 and 2011, respectively, than in the baseline. The two-sample independent t-test indicates that the mean income and expenditure of the member households were 47 and 32 per cent higher than the counterpart households. The Heckman model explains that cooperative societies have statistically significant, positive and robust effects on household food security at 1 per cent level. Research limitations/implications – A few variables might suffer from endogeneity problem, although theoretically insignificant and have no sound justification. The study also considers only two indicators of food security (income and expenditure), but the findings of the study would have been good and sound with several and composite food security index. Practical implications – Such impact studies on cooperative societies are limited in the study areas. Thus, this study helps decision-makers, cooperative analysts and other concerned bodies to give priority for cooperative societies so as to curtail the food insecurity problem. It can also make meaningful contributions to bridge the gap in the cooperative literature. Social implications – The present study can improve the understanding of cooperative societies in the country. The finding of this paper can serve as an input for university students, decision-makers and cooperative analysts. The result can also strengthen the economic justification for policy intervention on cooperative societies. Originality/value – Most studies in the areas address the financial performance, historical movement and opportunities and challenges of cooperative societies. This implies that more work is necessary to obtain a clear picture and broad spectrum about cooperative societies, and thus, this study addresses the effect of cooperative societies on household food security. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the financial sustainability of Tanzanian saving and credit cooperatives (SACCOs). Design/methodology/approach - The data set used in this study comes from SACCOs' audited financial reports for the year 2011. The performance was estimated using return on asset (ROA) and financial sustainability was estimated using the ratio of total expenses to total revenue. Linear regression was used to investigate the determinants of financial sustainability. Findings - The results show that, about 61 per cent of the sample SACCOs is operationally sustainable and 51 per cent of the total sample is both operationally and financially sustainable. The average sustainability score was 127 per cent. On average, the results for profitability (measured by ROA) is higher than some of the results reported for standard microfinance in the region and globally. In terms of sustainability the result forecasts a promising future for financial cooperative business model as an alternative form of financing the poor. Research limitations/implications - Only SACCOs with audited financial statements were included in the study, thus the conclusion is limited to SACCOs with similar characteristics. Future work might consider extending the analysis to include SACCOs with non-audited financial statements. Practical implications - Based on the sample SACCOs can under good management can be used as a sustainable social conduit for financial access and social economic development among the poor in Tanzania. Originality/value - This study contributes in two ways. First, it contributes towards the scanty empirical literature on the performance of SACCOs in developing countries and in Tanzania in particular. Second, it provides provocative evidence which appears to contradict earlier and more pessimistic accounts and it challenges the ontology about extending member-based microfinance. Copyright © 2015.

In Norway, alongside mandatory quotas regulating the composition of Public Limited Company boards, voluntary quotas were designed to increase women's membership on the boards of agricultural co-operatives. This radical step to secure a minimum of 40 per cent women makes these boards an interesting site for investigating the construction of gender in a traditionally male-dominated organization. In the debate, arguments in favour of a quota accentuated diversity and differences between women's and men's competences, opinions and values. The analysis of interview data from the boards of four agricultural co-operatives suggests that equal representation is a muted, taken-for-granted value. Equality and diversity are not understood as incompatible ideas, and gender is produced dynamically through practice rather than constituted as an inherent, fixed attribute. Gender as difference is less pervasive than expected as women tend to be recognized as belonging to the gender-neutral category of a board representative despite any recognized differences. The study demonstrates that voluntary quotas may change the context and both challenge old assumptions and promote new understandings of gender in local situations. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Through this analysis, I show that the movement's administration of a democratically managed form of agricultural production exemplifies a unique form of social movement resistance – namely, what I call self-governmental resistance. Rather than reformist or revolutionary contention, self-governmental resistance – performed by movements like the MST – redevelops state policies by vying for and often taking control over the design and implementation of agricultural production. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

We find that in the case of the cooperative types of MFIs, increases in average loan sizes are associated with decreases in female participation in the administration and governance. Further, the findings demonstrate that with increases in the participation of women borrowers, the number of women in organizational governance also increases. These findings suggest important research and practical implications regarding women’s empowerment through participation in mutual cooperative societies.

	abstract = {This paper empirically shows the influence of two contradictory institutional logics on practice variation by studying the case of an agricultural cooperative group in which cooperative and financial logics rub shoulders. It also explores how the link between institutional logics and practice variation leads to a particular performance level in the newly created practice. The Delphi research method has been used to test theoretical concepts, interviewing a panel of 24 experts. Results show that the influence of practice variation can become a key element in evaluating the performance of new practices in agricultural cooperatives. The results highlight the fact that it might be possible to find a balance between cooperative and capitalist logics, by implementing an appropriate governance structure. These results show how important it is for a cooperative group to communicate effectively, to maintain democratic management and links with the membership, and to give its administrators topquality training.

	abstract = {Prior to 2007, Uganda pursued a centralized strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction that placed greater emphasis on agricultural development as a means for empowering citizens in the rural sector where 80% of the population lives and derives livelihood through various forms of subsistence farming. Since coming to power in 1986, the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Government has pursued various policies such as Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) approach under the Prosperity for All (PFA) program. Instead of enriching all Ugandans, the PFA program has benefited few individuals who are politically well-connected to the ruling elite. Based on a historical comparative analysis of impact studies of MFIs and SACCOs in Uganda, we are inclined to further argue that the program has failed to stimulate economic development and reduce chronic poverty because its activities and operations have excluded the rural people who need them the most. Unlike traditional SACCOs that are owned and controlled by their members and rely on member savings and share capital, political SACCOs rely almost entirely on government loans channeled through the Microfinance Support Center (MSC) and Uganda Post Bank. The poor performance of rural credit programs in Uganda is attributed to widespread corruption and politicization of their operations. The greatest challenge facing political SACCOs in Uganda is how best to protect themselves from direct government control, while continuing to receive government funding.},

While, in the agricultural sector, much of the literature on agricultural co-operatives has highlighted their continued market dominance, this article focuses on the case of an unsuccessfully transformed tobacco co-operative in the small South African town of Mokopane. While state deregulation of the agricultural sector did not mean that all forms of associational support for farmers were lost, farmers there faced a more precarious position. A general decline in farming has resulted in significant changes in the nature of land utilisation. Mining and game farming have become the district’s economic mainstay. This article also highlights shifts away from communal, inter-personal forms of organisation within co-operatives well before the official coming of the neo-liberal epoch. None the less, the scope of decision-making by co-operative management was limited by the oversight of the Ministry of Agriculture, which functioned as a safety net of sorts, but also considered that the interests of ordinary farmers were best upheld by co-operatives remaining non-profit entities. © 2015 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.},

It draws on a community study conducted in a former coal-mining town in the United Kingdom. The policy background is the UK's Digital by Default agenda, which seeks to make online services the primary form of service access and transaction. In the context of a digitally organized society, a person's status is created through his or her ability to provide certain status markers to authenticate who they are. Status is created through a person's file, and those lacking an online profile become thin-filed and therefore excluded from many online services. The article argues that digital authentication is a feature of the formation of status in a digitally organized society. Without online system files, individuals lack the power to access public services, banks, credit unions, and e-commerce, and they feel a lack of social honor because of their low authentication status. © 2015 (Bridgette Wessels).},

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate the factors that affect the market exit of Brazilian singular credit unions from 1995 to 2009; it also identifies and lists the determinants of various types of market exits and analyzes whether profitability is a significant factor for credit union survival. This study was conducted with accounting data provided by the Central Bank of Brazil, which derives only from individual cooperatives, i.e. singular credit unions. Quarterly financial statements from these credit unions that were active from 1995 to the second quarter of 2009 were employed, totaling 71,325 observations for 1,929 credit unions. Based on survival and the model of competing risks (such as the Cox, Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, and Competing Risk models), the results show that there is no statistical evidence to ensure a correlation between profitability and credit union survival. The results also suggest that the size of credit unions plays a key role in their survival and longevity and that their funding and investment management are related to their survival and risk of market exit. In conclusion, the results confirm the initial idea that the duality inherent to credit unions - cooperative principles versus economic efficiency - might influence the stability, survival, and longevity of these institutions. Such results may also imply that a credit union embracing the rationale of a private bank will become more estranged from its members, something which will hinder its future operations and increase the likelihood of its exit from the market.},

The analysis suggests that cooperatives as organizational forms throw up special challenges to the OB researchers, as they are special types of organizations that incorporate business-like features of the investor-owned firms as well as the voluntary nature of nonprofits, thereby increasing the complexity of the context to make it an interesting area of research. For future research, OB researchers will have to go beyond the employee-centric research to include cooperative members as important constituent of the organization, specifically focussing on trust, commitment, organizational citizenship behaviour and leadership behaviour. The article identifies certain roadblocks in getting the attention of the researchers in the OB area and suggests certain ways to overcome these roadblocks. © 2015 Institute of Rural Management},

Extending organization theory on memory and forgetting, we detail how commemoration not only tends to legitimate capitalist forms of organizing, but also excludes alternatives. Finntowns, with their emphasis on cooperative organizations and community, provide a unique opportunity for organization studies to explore commemoration and forgetting in terms of power relations, time, and space. These marginalized spaces contained alternative organizations coexisting and contrasting with dominant capitalist organizations.

For the past thirty years in Greece, numerous women's agricultural co-operatives have been established in rural areas and scholars have articulated several aspects of their role in both women's life and the local development. A cursory glance at the history of the women's agricultural co-operatives in Greece and a review of the literature highlights the uniqueness of this type of entrepreneurship (a rarity in Europe) and their significant role for rural society cohesion, mainly in geographically and economically isolated rural areas. In this paper we employ a SWOT analysis to elaborate on strengths and weaknesses, which vary from co-operative to co-operative. Either bottom-up or top-down created women's co-operatives are currently a social innovation. Their strengths mainly concern economic independence and social inclusion of women in rural areas, while their weaknesses are mainly associated with funding, organization, administration, know how, culture, product promotion and marketing problems. Nevertheless, they are called upon to survive in a competitive environment; although difficult, it is one that provides opportunities that most likely can outweigh threats. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

In this study, we investigate the changes in benefits to borrowing and saving members around the adoptions of transactional websites by credit unions for the period of 2000–2009. Using the propensity score matching method, we show that credit union adopters offered borrowing members a better interest rate than non-adopters immediately after the recession of 2001–2002 and a similar rate when economy rebounded. Our results indicate that transactional websites offer credit union members more convenient services with no negative impact on the interest rate on deposits. The results are robust to different definitions of internet-based services non-adopters and different models used to estimate adoption probabilities. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In Northeast Thailand, the Alternative Agriculture Network Isan (AAN Isan) is struggling to secure income and subsistence agriculture for its members. This is achieved through a number of activities, some of which are introduced here in detail. Producer cooperatives, organic farming, green markets, or a local herb medicine center all aim at empowerment within the present market situation by using aspects of the health discourse to support their arguments and at the same time reinforcing a specific local politics of identity, rooted in notions of culture and religion.},

The methodology includes a literature review, interaction with officials, rice experts and insurance experts, and discussion with farmers. A study was undertaken at province level to assess the impact of using rainfall index as a threshold. Additionally, focused group discussions (FGD) were conducted with rice farmers at the village level. Key issues targeted in the FGD were to understand the behavior and practices during droughts, impact of drought on crop yield, methods already in use to reduce the impact, such as plantation of drought-resistant rice, and the adoption of crop insurance. Data availability is a challenge and has led to withdrawal ofWeather Index Insurance (WII) in 2015. WII have threshold levels based on historical rainfall. Adoption of coping mechanisms, such as drought-resistant rice and irrigation increases the chances of adverse selection. In absence of ground based weather data, a combination of satellite agriculture drought information can be used to make crop insurance more attractive as it would help in reducing basis risk and improving insurers and farmers' confidence in the product. Discussion with farmers, insurance companies, and the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) in Thailand suggested low awareness among farmers about the potential benefits of weather index insurance products. Relatively low compensation is also an obstacle. Proper marketing and awareness raising campaigns should also accompany the introduction of index-based insurance products. © 2016 by the author.},

We consider the case of Mozambique, where the government has made agricultural concessions to corporations, as well as land grants to communities. These uses may stand in competition with one another, and we test if violence affects the awarding of concessions or land grants. We analyze district-level, GIS-generated data on concessions, grants, and civil war events. We find wartime violence intensity is associated with more concessions and fewer grants. We conversely find recentness of violence is associated with fewer concessions and more grants. Embedding our empirical analysis in a community resilience framework, we suggest the intensity of wartime violence may erode local institutions - be they traditional governance structures, or agricultural cooperatives seeking community lands - or limit their access to government bodies and local NGOs tasked with vetting, delimiting, and monitoring proposed concessions. Paradoxically, recentness violence may mobilize those same institutions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Drawing on interview data collected from senior administrators, teachers, governors and students in the school, this paper seeks to understand why a school with a commitment to social justice would go down the academy route given the social justice concerns raised by such a move. This paper also considers if becoming a co-operative academy presents an ironic opportunity to resist many of the current regressive educational trends epitomised by academisation. This paper suggests that within the current English context, as in many other locations, a socially just approach to schooling requires alternatives to be explored and that the case study school's engagement with the Co-operative Society might present one such exploration. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

	abstract = {Banking services (mobile money services and platforms) in most countries today is no doubt technology driven. In Nigeria, for instance, the introduction of electronic banking has brought some advancements and complications to the ways and manners in which banking services are performed. In fact, the resultant effect of techno-driven (technologydriven) banking services on savings and borrowing patterns of the rural poor cannot be undermined. This paper relied on data collected through questionnaire from a random sample of 250 respondents from rural Southwest Nigeria. A descriptive analysis of the data revealed average age of those surveyed to be 52 years with a mean household size of 6 members. Respondents' distribution by gender showed there were more males (53.6%) than females with 38.8% and 61.2% of the former and the latter having no formal education. Data analysis on available and accessible techno-driven banking services revealed use of mobile phones and occasional transactions from the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) as the most patronised. However, the result of probit model employed to ascertain drivers/enablers of technodriven banking services showed age, gender, household size, educational status, poverty level, power infrastructure and cooperative society membership as very important. While the coefficients of age, gender, educational status and cooperative society membership were significant and positive, those of household size, distance to banking facility, power infrastructure and poverty status were negative and significant. It is therefore, recommended that effort should be intensified at capacity building of respondents in order to catch up with the growing trend in technology advancement in the banking sector. Also, improvement in the dilapidated state of road and power and infrastructures in the study area is very crucial to effectively harness the benefit of mobile money services. © Isaac B.

Specifically, the authors identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China (traditional and modern ones) when the external environment changes, the cooperative size expands and heterogeneity in membership widens. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assume that the "uncertainty of the external environment" and the "deviation of organisational adaptation" constitute the two dynamic factors that generated risks for farmer cooperatives. A survey of 158 farmer cooperatives is obtained in Zhejiang province in 2010, and factor analysis is employed to identify the risks and their critical degrees of traditional and modern cooperatives. Findings - The results indicate that two types of cooperatives in China face drastically different sets of risks. Traditional cooperatives face larger competitive and human resources risks, whereas modern cooperatives face larger decision-making and behavioural risks. Product market risk, macroeconomic policy risk and financial risk are common critical risks faced by both types of cooperatives. Originality/value - In this paper, risks in China's farmer cooperatives were empirically studied and systematically discussed. The paper offers a typology to identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China (traditional and modern ones) according to property rights arrangements and governance structure.

We have developed more specific theoretical insights about this special kind of decision-making cost by showing the effect of differences in the level of member participation on democratic costs, differences in terms of democratic and influence costs and in terms of agency costs, and differences between both direct and opportunity democratic costs. Members should take both the relative direct and opportunity costs within total democratic costs into account when determining the optimal size and composition of their board. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Nonetheless, in the early 1990s, the first farmers’ cooperative marketing organizations, which were called agricultural producer groups, appeared in the market. T ese groups are bottom-up, voluntary organizations the primary purpose of which is to jointly sell their members’ output. In this paper, it is investigated why the new forms of governance, namely cooperative arrangements, were chosen, and we evaluate the implications of these choices on the market success of these groups. Empirical data were collected from 62 producer groups in one Polish province. We found that the groups were typically functioning as associations, unions, and limited liability companies. The factors that had an impact on the choices made were the number of members and the specific investment per member. Additionally, if the initial investment level was low, not only set-up and operational costs but also tax considerations played a role in the decision. T erefore, we argue that the new bottom-up cooperatives, which are theoretically suitable when the start-up capital is high or the number of members is large, will gradually be recognized and accepted in the market despite the fact that these cooperatives have a “bad reputation” caused by the socialist legacy. The new cooperative development trend confirms this argument. © 2015, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All Rights Reserved.},

With the growing awareness of environmental issues, improved approaches to agri-environmental management have become important policy issues. Previous studies on agri-environmental policies have focused on individual farmers rather than on collective action. However, some agri-environmental issues need to be managed by farmers co-operatively. Collective action can facilitate geographically appropriate management of resources, allow for shared knowledge among members thus increasing their capacities, and provide solutions for dealing with agri-environmental issues. However, sometimes, transaction costs can hinder collective action from being initiated. Moreover, farmers often need external support such as scientific knowledge, technical information and financial assistance. Thus, external help from public agencies or other interested bodies may be necessary to promote collective action. Many local and central governments encourage farmers and other stakeholders to take initiatives to manage the environment by themselves through various policy measures including technical assistance and financial assistance programmes. Collaboration with intermediaries is also necessary to facilitate state-community relationships. Governments can assist agri-environmental management, as opposed to interfering with it, through better agri-environmental policies that promote collective action. L'agriculture a des effets à la fois positifs et négatifs sur l'environnement. Les questions environnementales se faisant de plus en plus présentes, il devient important d'améliorer la façon dont les politiques approchent la gestion agroenvironnementale. Jusqu'à présent, les études sur les politiques agroenvironnementales se sont intéressées aux agriculteurs individuels plutôt qu'aux actions collectives. Certaines questions environnementales demandent cependant une coopération entre agriculteurs. L'action collective peut faciliter la gestion des ressources à un niveau géographique adéquat, permettre de partager des connaissances entre membres, et donc améliorer leur capacité, et offrir des solutions pour régler les questions environnementales. Cependant, les coûts de transaction peuvent parfois empêcher l'émergence d'actions collectives. En outre, les agriculteurs ont souvent besoin d'une aide extérieure comme des connaissances scientifiques, des informations techniques et de l'aide financière. Une aide des agences publiques ou d'autres institutions intéressées peut être nécessaire pour promouvoir l'action collective. De nombreux pouvoirs publics centraux et locaux encouragent les agriculteurs et d'autres parties prenantes à prendre des initiatives pour gérer l'environnement par eux-mêmes par le biais de diverses mesures gouvernementales comme l'assistance technique et les programmes d'aide financière. La collaboration avec des intermédiaires est également nécessaire pour faciliter les relations entre pouvoirs publics et communautés. Les pouvoirs publics peuvent aider la gestion environnementale plutôt qu'interférer avec elle, en mettant en place des mesures agroenvironnementales qui promeuvent l'action collective. Die Landwirtschaft hat sowohl positive als auch negative Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt. Mit zunehmender Wahrnehmung von Umweltbelangen hat die Verbesserung der Ansätze zum Agrarumweltmanagement einen hohen politischen Stellenwert erreicht. Bisherige Untersuchungen zu Agrarumweltpolitiken konzentrierten sich eher auf einzelne landwirtschaftliche Betriebe als auf ein kollektives Vorgehen. Einige Umweltbelange erfordern allerdings die Zusammenarbeit der Landwirte untereinander. Ein kollektives Vorgehen kann eine geografisch sinnvolle Handhabung von Ressourcen erleichtern, die Weitergabe von Wissen untereinander fördern und somit zu einer höheren Leistungsfähigkeit führen sowie zur Lösungsfindung bei Umweltfragen beitragen. In einigen Fällen kann es jedoch vorkommen, dass es auf Grund von Transaktionskosten nicht zu einem kollektiven Vorgehen kommt. Zudem benötigen die Landwirte oftmals Unterstützung von außen wie z.B. Kenntnisse aus Wissenschaft und technische Informationen oder Finanzhilfen. Daher könnte Hilfe von außen seitens staatlicher Stellen oder anderer Einrichtungen des öffentlichen Interesses erforderlich sein, um ein kollektives Vorgehen zu fördern. Viele Regional- und Zentralregierungen ermutigen die Landwirte und weitere Akteure, die Initiative zu ergreifen und sich der Umweltbelange selbst mit Hilfe von verschiedenen Politikmaßnahmen sowie technischer Unterstützung und Programmen zur Finanzierungshilfe anzunehmen. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Vermittlern ist ebenfalls erforderlich, um die Beziehungen zwischen Staat und Kommunen zu fördern. Die Regierungen können das Agrarumweltmanagement unterstützen, anstatt hier störend einzugreifen, indem sie bessere Agrarumweltpolitiken schaffen, die ein kollektives Vorgehen fördern.

	abstract = {Credit unions are membership-based cooperative financial services organizations that are run by and for their members. Historically, credit unions provided financial services for their members and encouraged community development through philanthropy and volunteering. The World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), the sector's global trade association and development agency, encourages the adoption of a management model, coined "new model," which encourages for-profit financial management practices. The "new model" approach is challenged by some practitioners and academics concerned that it will diminish the community involvement of credit unions. We explore the following research question: "Does the implementation of a management model that promotes for-profit-style financial management crowd out the community impact of credit unions?" We use a dataset extracted from 2,275 annual returns for 188 credit unions spanning 1996-2008, and find no evidence that community impact diminishes as a result of "new model" operating practices, suggesting a crowding-out effect is absent. © The Author(s) 2013.},

The statistical analysis uses nationally representative data for 8350 randomly-selected households interviewed during 2004/05 for the second Malawi Integrated Household Survey. Regressions are estimated separately for households in the north, centre, and south of Malawi to account for spatial heterogeneity. Results of a multilevel logit model reveal that households are less likely to be food insecure if they have larger cultivated land per capita, receive agricultural field assistance, reside in a community with an agricultural cooperative and relatively high annual rainfall, and are headed by an individual with a high school degree. Factors that positively correlate with household food insecurity are price of maize, price of fertiliser, number of household members, and distance to markets. Implications of these findings for policy are discussed. © 2013 Development Bank of Southern Africa.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian government has been encouraging fish farming in cages in federal water bodies, including hydroelectric reservoirs. Despite the government support, it is a new activity and the production model still needs some adjustment to reduce the production costs and achieve sustainability. The aims of this study were to determine the appropriate stocking density of Nile tilapia in cages in a hydroelectric reservoir and to evaluate to what extent fish size selection could improve their uniformity. Twelve cages (6m3) were placed at the Fish Farmers' Cooperative of Santa Fé do Sul and Region, Ilha Solteira reservoir, São Paulo, Brazil (20°12'10″S, 50°58'31.15″W). In stage I (initial fish weight, 78g), four stocking densities were tested: D1-800, D2-2000, D3-2500 and D4-3000 fish/cage, with three replicates. At the end of this stage (average fish weight, 255g), the fish were selected into three sizes, except for D1. In stage II, four stocking densities were tested, designed to obtain the following final production: D1-100kg/m3 (800 non-selected fish/cage), D2-80kg/m3 (600 fish/cage), D3-100kg/m3 (800 fish/cage) and D4-120kg/m3 (900 fish/cage). The trial ended when the fish weighed 800g. By reducing the initial stocking density from 2500 to 800 tilapia juveniles per cage, there was no need for selection. The growth performance was higher, the feed conversion rate was better and the time taken to reach harvesting was shorter. Consequently, the production cost reduced and the operating profit increased. Using the lowest initial stocking density, the risk of disease outbreak was also lower, and there was no need to use drugs for disease control since the mortality rate and occurrences of disease and deformity decreased and the dissolved oxygen level inside the cages was higher. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Such problems are believed to be hindering the adoption of sustainable forest management (SFM) and forest certification by forest farmers in China. Two strategies were introduced by the Chinese government with the purpose of addressing these issues, namely forest tenure reforms and their associated supporting mechanism, forestry property markets. Through two case studies in southern China, we investigated the effectiveness of the two strategies as well as their implications for the adoption of SFM and forest certification. The two cases were Yong'an in Fujian province and Tonggu in Jiangxi province. Personal interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with small-scale forest farmers who had already benefited from the two strategies as well as market officers working for the two selected forestry property markets. The study identified eight issues constraining the potential adoption of SFM and certification in China, including limited finance, poorly developed infrastructure and transport systems, insecure forest tenures, inconsistent forest policies, low levels of awareness, illegal forest management practices, lack of local cooperative organizations, and inadequate knowledge and technical transfer. We found that the new forest tenure reforms and forestry property markets had generally fulfilled their original objectives and had the capacity to assist in addressing many of the issues facing forests prior to the reforms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although several initiatives including demand side management measures have already been implemented, consumers from different backgrounds suffer from various drawbacks of quality supply. This paper explores the valuation of electricity quality from the perspective of domestic consumers in Hyderabad, India. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with 798 urban households. For analysis, we apply a scale-adjusted latent class model to identify heterogeneity in preferences and in variance-scale. The results confirm the hypothesis of highly heterogeneous household preferences and reveal limited preparedness of domestic users to pay for improved electricity quality and renewable energy. Further, most respondents prefer state owned distribution companies to private enterprises or cooperative societies. We argue that the estimated preferences, implying demand and willingness to pay for single attributes of electricity quality, can help policy makers to adequately incorporate consumers' interests into decision making. The results further indicate that domestic tariff hikes should not be used to finance extension of renewable energies or infrastructure investment to improve reliability in supply. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

They have a long history, and an evolving and interesting future. The case of China is perhaps particularly significant, as the co-operatives there are operating still within the context of state control, and it is not clear how they might develop in the future. Were China to decide that the co-operative and mutual corporate form had an important role to play alongside state, personal and shareholder-ownership models, then given the significant role of China in the global economy, this could have a major impact on the type of corporate diversity the world's economy enjoys in future years. These ‘alternative’ corporate forms include consumer co-operatives and producer co-operatives, as well as financial mutuals and employee ownership. There have been calls for this broadly defined mutual sector to become the most dynamic part of the global economy by the end of this decade.

The social performance assessment follows an internationally renowned methodology of social auditing. It provides the database for the construction of a social output, which, apart from outreach, evaluates social network quality, client benefits (protection from over-indebtedness) and other items that have not been assessed in efficiency analysis before. We develop a new analytical model for Data Envelopment Analysis and gain meaningful results for the sample of ACCs.

	abstract = {AbstractExpected daily FL ranges (length at date) of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha have been used throughout California's Central Valley to identify federally listed winter-run and spring-run juveniles in a mixed four-race stock. Accurate race identification is critical both to species recovery and to management of the water supply for 25 million people and a multibillion-dollar agricultural industry. We used genetic race assignment of 11,609 juveniles sampled over 6 years to characterize the accuracy of the length-at-date approach, specifically by testing two of its central assumptions: (1) juvenile FL distributions do not overlap between races on a daily basis; and (2) the growth rates that are used to project FL at date are accurate. We found that 49% of FLs for genetically identified juveniles occurred outside the expected length-at-date ranges for their respective races, and we observed a high degree of overlap in FL ranges among the four races. In addition, empirical growth rates were well below those from which length-at-date criteria were derived. Given the high degree of FL overlap between races, we conclude that modification of the length-at-date method will not substantially reduce identification error. Thus, we recommend that genetic assignment be used at least as a supplemental approach to improve Central Valley Chinook Salmon race identification, research, and management. © 2014, © American Fisheries Society 2014.},

	abstract = {Haitian cocoa consists mainly of the Criollo and Trinitario varieties, which are in strong demand around the world and are used in high-quality chocolate production. But the potential of Haiti's cocoa has never been optimized: it has long been sold on the international market in the form of ordinary unfermented cocoa. Only recently have producers become aware of the benefits of producing fermented cocoa. In 2009, thanks to technical assistance from the Peruvian cooperative CEPICAFE for the Haitian cooperative network FECCANO, and thanks to support from the French NGO Agronomes et Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (AVSF), their fermented cocoa output was immediately taken up and marketed by European firms, including the French fair-trade company Ethiquable. Since then, the global quality cocoa market has opened up to Haitian cocoa. At the local level, the economic, social and environmental impacts of this innovation are significant. There are two main lessons to be drawn from this experience: (i) exchanges between developing countries should be stepped up in agricultural assistance programs, as the "success stories" identified in the different countries involved have a higher potential for replication; (ii) collaborative business relationships, initiated some years ago now by certain buyers from developed countries, can provide more sustainable support for the development of family agriculture in developing countries. International cooperation, with innovative approaches such as the one adopted in this case by AVSF can, therefore, make an effective contribution to the agricultural development of developing countries. To consolidate the impetus given to Haiti's cocoa industry by cocoa fermentation, it is essential to focus interventions on increasing the output of quality cocoa, on better targeting of niche markets, on reinforcing small-producer cooperatives, and on improving local governance in the cocoa sector. © Auteur(s) 2013.},

In this paper we discuss the conditions under which cooperatives develop and sustain and also the role of local and central actors using a case study approach. Since cooperatives in the socialist system provided numerous social services and contributed to rural development, another research question concerns the survival of this tradition. Through twin case studies in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and East Germany we present the conditions and strategies for achieving sustainability of co-operatives. The results reveal important requirements for cooperatives to be sustainable: overcoming the communist legacy of mistrust against cooperative organizations, convincing members by building trust, coping with fundamental collective action problems, constructive communication that takes the problems and ideas of members seriously, finding cooperative leaders able to cope with members' opportunism and a facilitating state encouraging the development of cooperatives. © 2014 CIRIEC.},

	abstract = {The immediate consequences of the 2009 reform of the cotton sector in Benin are assessed from the farmers' perspective. Using a policy arrangements approach, we analyse how farmers experienced the transformations brought about by the reform and how it influenced their day-to-day activities. The new farmer cooperatives established after the reform were trusted by farmers. Many farmers returned to the sector, increasing cotton output. Nevertheless, productivity remained low, around 900 kg/ha, probably because the reform addressed mainly institutional constraints. Technical constraints relating to varietal choice, soil fertility improvement, and pest management were neglected. The policy arrangements emerging from the reform still generate discussion, in particular about the way actors and coalitions are organized. The top-down approach of the reform process has limitations for problem-solving, especially where actors' interests collide. The adjustments made under the reform with regard to farmer-based organizations and actors from public services, the caution solidaire, and farmers' supervision proved inappropriate for solving the institutional problems posed at the nodes of actors and coalitions, resources, discourses, and institutions, thereby further undermining the cotton sector. A mix of technological and institutional reforms might offer a more effective option for the future. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Feeding and forage-related needs were the most frequently assessed in the case studies involving smallholders raising small ruminants or cattle, whereas organization-related needs were the most frequently assessed in those involving smallholder livestock cooperatives. Meeting the feed and forage requirements of small ruminants and cattle is the most urgent need for livestock smallholders, but addressing this challenge will be difficult without concurrent control of the breeding season and common diseases as well as implementation of appropriate methods to track and cull unproductive animals. Empowerment of grass-roots organizations, particularly women's cooperatives, through literacy programmes and effective extension outreach could have significant impacts on the improvement of smallholder livestock enterprises.},

This study sheds light on alternative ownership-control models adopted by agricultural cooperatives in different regions across the world. In each of these models, we describe the allocation of formal control rights with a focus on decision management and decision control rights. We thus provide empirical evidence on the "separation of ownership and control" in agricultural cooperatives. We also analyze each of the governance models in terms of the associated ownership costs, including risk-bearing costs, the costs of controlling managers, and collective decision-making costs. In doing so, we are able to better understand the forces influencing the organizational efficiency of each cooperative model. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this, an effort was made for economic analysis of marketing costs incurred by Jaipur dairy in milk marketing. The study was based on secondary data of Jaipur Dairy Cooperatives which were collected from the monthly progress reports, audit reports and other related records of Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation, Jaipur Dairy Plant, Jaipur as well as from the milk collection and chilling centers. In order to study the marketing cost which includes the cost of collection and processing of milk, the data were collected from Jaipur Dairy Plant on different aspects viz., chilling charges, transportation cost and commission to milk collection cooperative societies, water and electricity charges, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and interest on capital expenditure. The data were arranged in simple tabular form and simple averages and percentages by total costs were computed, unit costs were also calculated by dividing each cost incurred by the quantity of milk handled. It has been found that the average total cost of milk collection spent by Jaipur Dairy was Rs. 18.79 and the average total cost of milk processing was Rs. 2.33/1 during the year 2009-10. These unit costs of milk collection and milk processing are important for policy and decision makers when they make policies and developmental programmes related to dairy sector for boosting the economy.},

Thus, the first purpose of this study was to specify criteria for performance benchmarking, and identify best practices in palm oil contract farming. Second, we also aimed at developing and implementing a benchmarking model with criteria for trading the products from palm oil contract farming. The approach to these goals was to collect data about palm oil marketing practices in the study area, and about contract farming economic status and practices. To test for validity or results, assigned trading practices were used for 3 months, and the results assessed qualitatively. There were three types of participants, namely (1) 73 farmers who joined the program, (2) the Wattana Agricultural Cooperative Oil Palm ramp, and (3) the Jiras Palm crushing plant. The best practices from the study overall fit the policy to "improve quality - reduce costs -increase price ". The best practice for farmers was to improve fresh fruit bunch quality by adjusting the harvesting cycle, and to sell as a group or create a farmer network based on quality policy. The best practices at ramps included comprehensive and vivid grading criteria, trustworthy quality selection, price incentive based on oil palm fruit bunch quality, management policy, public relations, technical assistance to suppliers, guaranteed accurate weighing scales, and establishment of a harvest team. The best practices of crushing plants were to create incentives for customers, quality-based purchasing policy, and attention to transportation advantages.},

Our model provides a reason why Coops are less prone than PMFs to pay variable bonuses to their managers. We show that this occurs under price competition when in equilibrium the Coop prefers to pay a flat wage to its manager relying instead on her intrinsic motivation, whereas the profit-maximizing rival adopts a variable, high-powered incentive scheme. The main rationale is that, by recruiting a manager whose preferences are aligned with the company goals (e.g., a consumer-owner), the Coop is per se highly expansionary in term of output. Therefore, the Coop does not need to rely on an externally hired manager who sets prices aggressively to expand market share and quantity. Furthermore, adopting a monetary reward based on sales and profits leads to distorted incentives with respect to the Coop’s goal, which after all is the welfare of its members. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {This article shows how paramilitaries and allied companies put grassroots development discourses of political participation and subsidiarity, environmental conservation, and ethnic empowerment to work in executing and ratifying their massive land grab in northwest Colombia. More than a case of trying to "whitewash" their malfeasance with fashionable and politically correct development-speak, I argue that the grassroots development apparatus-its discourses, institutional forms, and practices-became utterly instrumental to the illegal land seizures. Moreover, when operating alongside practices of land parcelization, iterative transactions, producers' cooperatives, and third-party intermediaries, grassroots development facilitated what could be called "land laundering." In the process, grassroots development became a conduit for paramilitary-backed state formation in which projects of liberal governance commonly associated with the imperatives of institution building, good governance, and the rule of law became perversely compatible with the region's economies of violence. With the World Bank increasingly concerned over the conflation of fragile states, violent conflict, and alarming land grabs, this article raises questions about how the grassroots solutions currently being endorsed by the Bank can in some cases actually facilitate dispossession, illicit economies, and violent political projects. The way paramilitaries harnessed grassroots development also has critical implications for debates about post-development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, management deficits, including the lack of regular financial audits, poses a threat to the sustainability and commercial success of these local voluntary associations and the positive impact that they might have on the welfare of their members. This paper considers how the provision of financial audit services for agricultural cooperatives can be strengthened. We assess the current status of agricultural cooperatives in the country and the demand and supply of financial audit services for them. We then review the approaches taken in 11 other countries for providing financial audit services to agricultural cooperatives in order to identify approaches Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives might consider. Insights are gained on the need for capacity building within cooperatives on financial oversight, building internal incentives for cooperatives to have conducted regular financial audits on their accounts, addressing the deficit of auditors within Ethiopia, and creating reporting mechanisms so that any emerging financial problems within a cooperative are made known and addressed in a timely manner. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Three out of four poor people live in rural areas, and the majority of rural inhabitants depend on agriculture. Access to appropriate financial services is a critical factor for agricultural development and yet, due to the specific constraints that come with financing agriculture (reaching isolated rural areas, working with highly seasonal activities, agro-climatic risks, etc.), developing an adequate supply of financial services remains a challenge in most of agricultural countries. Agriculture is one of the most determinative sectors of the Albanian economy and the main working alternative of people living in the rural areas. Microfinance programs target both economic and social poverty. To assess the effectiveness of these programs, MFIs need to measure the impact on the borrowers, who in our case are the farmers. The goal of this research paper pertained to economic impacts analysis, and what their implication on the farmers' income and activity is. In general, the study has identified various positive impacts on the farmers' activities that proclaim that ASC Union services are useful and viable. To assess these impacts, 100 questionnaires were conducted in Central and North Albania, while SPSS Software program with the main purpose to show the level of involvement of the farmers in the micro credit program and a model based on two-way causalities, together with econometric tools such as regression, cross-tabulation and correlation analysis, to address the issues of impacts were used. Overall, our study found out that 27% of the farmers choose to borrow from ASC Union because taking out a loan from this credit union is easier than borrowing from another MFI, while 15% said that ASC Union has the lowest interest rate in the credit market for the micro loans. Furthermore, 87 farmers out of 100, who were 4 to 10 year-old-members of the credit union, had their income increased in the last 3 years, whereas only 13 farmers answered that there was no change in their income in those years. Moreover, the farmers who took out 2, 3, 4 or 5 micro loans admitted that the micro loan was useful and helped them to increase and improve their activities, while on the other hand the ones who took just one loan proclaimed that there is no change in their income or activities.},

	abstract = {En adhérent à une coopérative agricole, les agriculteurs s'engagent à participer économiquement à celle-ci en tant que coopérateurs et également à participer à son gouvernement, en tant qu'associés. Or aujourd'hui, les chercheurs et directeurs de coopératives constatent une baisse de ces deux niveaux de participation. Ce papier a pour objectif de construire une typologie des adhérents de coopératives agricoles du secteur céréalier français au regard de leurs comportements de participation puis d'identifier les déterminants qui expliquent l'appartenance des adhérents à une des classes de la typologie à partir d'un modèle probit multinomial. Nous faisons l'hypothèse que les attitudes de confiance et d'implication organisationnelles manifestées par l'adhérent envers sa coopérative peuvent expliquer ces différences de comportements aux côtés de variables individuelles liées à l'adhérent et son exploitation agricole et de variables liées à la coopérative à laquelle il adhère. L'analyse des comportements de participation permet de regrouper les 290 adhérents de l'échantillon en trois classes distinctes: «les individualistes», «les bons soldats» et «les engagés». Les résultats du probit multinomial sur ces 3 classes montrent notamment un effet significatif de l'attitude d'implication organisationnelle, de la présence de stockage à la ferme et de la taille de la coopérative sur la probabilité d'être individualiste par rapport aux deux autres classes. When a farmer joins an agricultural cooperative, he or she undertakes to participate in the cooperative economically, as a co-operator, and also in its administration, as an associate. Yet, today, researchers and directors of cooperatives are observing a drop in member participation in both spheres. The goal of this paper is to build a typology of the members of grain farmer agricultural co-operatives in France, based on the members' participation, and then use a multinomial probit model to identify the factors that come into play and result in a member belonging to a given category in the typology. We make the hypothesis that attitudes with respect to organizational involvement and the member's confidence in his or her co-operative can explain these differences in behavior, along with individual variables tied to the member and his or her farm business, and variables associated with the co-operative to which the member belongs. Following the analysis of the participation behavior of the 290 members in the sample, the members can be grouped into three distinct categories: "individualists," "good soldiers," and "engaged.". © 2013 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

	abstract = {The third publication phase of the new Rural Sociology series (1998-2005) is presented in five parts. In the first part the author examines the socio-economic context: changes and problems in the agrarian and social structure caused by privatization based on the doctrine of neoliberal capitalism, refeudalization of village and agriculture, war consequences, intense social stratification and 40% fall in agricultural production, compared to 1988 and 1989. In the second part the author presents the crisis and implosion of the oldest Croatian infrastructure unit for rural sociological research and two research projects about the Croatian village in transition, settlement network and network society done in the Institute for Social Research in Zagreb. The third part is about the journal's logistics. Systematic rural sociological research lost all financial support in the last decade of 20th century which caused the final exodus of researchers. Along with the desintegration of the rural sociology school in Zagreb, it meant the loss of institutional support for the scientific rural sociology periodical. The highest price of the wrong policy was paid: human capital was squandered and the research field lost. The Institute's other research teams could not back up the very specialized journal of rural sociology. The fourth part of the presentation deals with the new concept of overcoming the crisis, editorial policy, changes in the Board and Council and the new profile of the journal which eventually changed its name in 2006. The original concept from 1963 was broadened and it comprised the cooperation of the Institute's research potential with contributions from sociology and other similar disciplines whose primary interest was social, economic and cultural development, based on rural, urban and spatial research, agroecology, protection of ruralism and bioethics. The journal's profile was defined as problem-solving and Rural Sociology remained the primary scholarly journal with the same structure and publication frequency. The fifth part is dedicated to the journal's achievements, primarily its most valuable works which defined the profile of the new series. The journal basically overcame the crisis and made up for the lost time, money and human potential by opening up to contributions from other scientific disciplines (first about the ruralurban continuum, settlement network and social processes in space, then about religious and other research in the Institute), and to foreign authors. Because of their excellence the author singles out 12 contributions by home authors and 9 thematic issues among which stands out the jubilee issue for the 40th anniversary of the continued publication of the first Croatian sociology journal. It was entitled "People who created Rural Sociology". Other special issues with their recent and well-founded theories and methodology include village in transition, network of settlements and network society, islanders and island communities and agricultural cooperatives. Due to a large number of scientific works (six out of ten), based on experimental research of the Croatian society and village, Rural Sociology is a valuable and visible publication in the world scholarly community; there is reference to works published in it in eight world data banks. © 2013 Institute for Social Research in Zagreb - All rights reserved.},

The study was based on two national surveys - one directed at a wide range of non-school state, private and cooperative organisations; the other at primary and secondary schools. The specific objective was to determine the extent to which the promoters and facilitators of EE/ESD have adopted the new trends and concepts emerged in this area, taking into account the fact that on-going initiatives may follow two differing approaches: i) a more naturalist and traditional approach based on natural scientific knowledge, and ii) a newly-developing and more innovative approach that places greater emphasis on the close ties and dynamic relationships between environmental quality, socio-political and socio-economic factors. Notwithstanding controversies arising for differing reasons (inertia/conservatism or complaint/contestation), the aim of this new approach is to achieve a more significant role for sustainable development in the broad social field of citizenship education and mobilising support for sustainable development. By reporting some of the most representative results, our aim is to contribute to a description of EE/ESD based on empirical observation. One finding, for example, refers to the persistent narrowing of the field of action that results from the predominance of ecological over civic issues. The general picture, despite some exceptions, is of initiatives dominated by traditional formats and themes (e.g. urban solid waste, nature conservation) and an underestimation of other areas of equal importance for sustainable development, such as greater coordination between schools and local communities in dealing with problems related to socio-economic, health, urban planning, quality of life, etc. Trend that is also evident in the excessive weight given to younger students, to the detriment of a wider approach that would broaden the scope of EE by including the entire age range of school communities, and a model that involves more effective ties with local communities, as described above.},

	abstract = {Currently, the alternative forms of management are increasingly applied in agriculture. Although their less negative impact on environment is generally supposed, there is still a lack of a reliable data about their real favourability for the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates, including millipedes. Therefore, the aim of our study was to find out, whether the form of agricultural management affects the structure of millipede communities and hence, the performance of their functions in soil ecosystems. The research was carried out using pitfall trapping through growing seasons 2005 to 2007 on the model territory of Agricultural Cooperative (AC) Očová (Central Slovakia). Millipedes were captured at four pairs of sites (8 sites in total). The same cultivated crop (wheat, barley, alfalfa or permanent law) with application of two different forms of agricultural management (conventional form and sustainable form with basic sustainable agro-environmental scheme) was characteristic of each pair of sites. The research results disclosed that the management form plays a significant role, especially in such agrocoenoses, in which the same crop is cultivated for several years (e.g. sites with alfalfa or permanent lawn), i.e., on the sites without ploughing or other similar agrotechnical measures. In these cases, the sites with the sustainable agro-environmental scheme had higher species richness (8 and 9 species) and higher total abundance of millipede communities (2.2 and 5.7 ind. collected per one day and one trap) than the sites with the conventional form of agrotechnical management (5 and 5 species, 0.09 and 0.3 ind. collected per one day and one trap). In order to obtain a more detailed knowledge about the impact of agricultural management forms on millipede communities, this kind of research should be carried out in different conditions (other crops, soil conditions, climate zones, etc.) as well. © 2014, Polish Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {This study has been undertaken with the purpose of assessing the role of craft and artisan cooperatives in the socio-economic advancement of their members in Abia State. The paper specifically identify and describes the socio-economic characteristics of members of the cooperative societies; find out the ways that members benefit from the cooperative group; examine the contributions of the cooperatives to rural economic activities in the study area; identify the constraints limiting the optimum performance of the cooperatives in the study area and make recommendations for greater effectiveness of craft and artisan cooperative societies in the study area. Survey design was adopted to conduct this study. Data was collected with the help of a self-administered researcher-constructed Questionnaire administered on 400 members of craft and artisan cooperative societies that were purposively selected. A pilot test of the instruments gave reliability estimates of 0.79. Data was analyzed descriptively using frequency, simple percentage and rank-order respectively. Results obtained (partial listing) indicated that education (of members) is a significant indicator that can effectively mobilize cooperative societies to attract government presence for assistance, lack of educated members could hinder the leadership structure of the group. Meeting frequently (usually weekly) could help to sustain cooperative societies and also serve as a catalyze for sharing of knowledge and new ideas which could be effective in improving business, solving personal and group challenges as well as increase work productivity. The Osusu scheme could help to abate poverty and solve the problem of insufficient and lack of fund which a significant population of craft men and artisans face often times. Finally, result shows that insufficient fund, migration, non governmental support, corruption among leaders etc. are some of the limiting factors to the optimum performance of craft and artisan cooperative societies in the study area. It was therefore concluded that organize effort to mobilize craft and artisans for cooperative spirit in the study area, and anywhere else, could assist to increase access to fund, dissemination of information and innovations, and reduce poverty.},

	abstract = {This study examined the extent to which farmer cooperatives enjoy social capital within their memberships as they become internationalised. The empirical basis was a survey of farmers in Finland. Findings from limited dependent variable regression models suggest that the farmers who are most loyal to their cooperatives tend to oppose its foreign investments. Another group of farmers tended to switch membership status between different cooperatives, and a third group tended to opt out of cooperatives. The two latter categories were characterised by a lower level of social capital, and both of them welcomed the cooperatives’ international operations. This finding was more significant for individual farm types than the social capital-linked opposition to internationalisation. A general conclusion is that the internationalisation of cooperatives seems to affect the members’ trust in the cooperative differently. Thus there is increasing heterogeneity within the memberships which may give rise to governance problems. © 2014, MTT Agrifood Research Finland. All rights reserved.},

Results from a qualitative study of managers and professionals across a variety of industries suggest that voice to targets at different formal power levels (peers or superiors) and locations in the organization (inside or outside a focal unit) differs systematically in terms of its usefulness in generating actions to a unit's benefit on the issues raised and in the likely information value of the ideas expressed. We then theorize how distinct voice flows should be differentially related to unit performance based on these core characteristics and test our hypotheses using time-lagged field data from 801 employees and their managers in 93 units across nine North American credit unions. Results demonstrate that voice flows are positively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at the focal leader of that unit-who should be able to take action-whether from that leader's own subordinates or those in other units, and negatively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at coworkers who have little power to effect change. Together, these studies provide a structural framework for studying the nature and impact of multiple voice flows, some along formal reporting lines and others that reflect the informal communication structure within organizations. This research demonstrates that understanding the potential performance benefits and costs of voice for leaders and their units requires attention to the structure and complexity of multiple voice flows rather than to an undifferentiated amount of voice. © The Author(s) 2013.},

The credit union is run by the Catholic diocese that envisioned prosperity to its members coming from different religious denominations and from low income families thus the need to recommend improvements to ensure its sustainability and service to the community. The study analyzed financial performance from 2007 to 2012 and determined members’ satisfaction of services rendered. It used semi-structured survey instruments, personal interview, and focus group discussion to gather data. Findings of the study revealed that members’ savings were not sufficiently protected. However, members were very satisfied with almost all of the services offered by the credit union. The study concludes that there is a need to improve its portfolio quality and liquidity management as evidenced by a high rate of loan delinquency. To ensure more sustainable operations, it is recommended that management exert effort to increase net loans receivables but at the same time address members’ high delinquency rate for loans. Additional investment on liquid assets is suggested for loan portfolio to generate more revenue and increase the net institutional capital. It is further recommended that future studies would include governance and organizational performance particularly on credit management processes to complement the results of this study. © 2014, University of San Jose-Recoletos.

Using a recent innovative approach termed the "Wallet Allocation Rule (WAR)" this research investigates whether measuring satisfaction relative to other competitors used exhibits a stronger correlation to share of deposits compared to measuring absolute satisfaction with the focal firm/product. Design/methodology/approach: A survey approach was used with a sample of 4,712 banking customers across the USA. Using the WAR, each respondent's satisfaction ratings were transformed into relative rankings and used to estimate their share of deposits. Findings: The results confirmed that at both the individual and the aggregate level examining relative ranked satisfaction correlates strongly with customers' share of deposits. At the individual level relative satisfaction explains 55 percent of the variance in share of deposits, as opposed to only 9 percent for absolute satisfaction. Practical implications: The findings indicate that managers need to rethink their current approach to satisfaction measurement and consider measuring their customers' satisfaction relative to competitors used. Furthermore, using aggregate level absolute satisfaction in managerial decision making can be misleading. Originality/value: This research provides a significant contribution to both the banking literature and the scientific literature in general by examining the robustness of a relative metrics approach within the retail banking and credit union market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The catchment area served by that stud covered nearly half of the province. Four years later, in response to the progressing post-war reconstruction, intensive growth of state-owned farms and farmers' cooperatives, another stallion stud was created in Braniewo. The formation of both studs was greatly aided by the State Stallion Stud in Kwidzyn. Horses from the two studs in the Province of Olsztyn were used for work in farming, for transport as well as for recreation and sports horse riding. Some of the horses could also be seen in historical films. However, the technological progress in farming gradually depreciated the role of horses, which led to a decline in horse breeding.

Our objective in the above discussion is to advance a conceptual framework using new institutional economics theories that draws attention to the importance of the organizational structure of contractors for the design of the proliferation of contracts increasingly governing agricultural production. Understanding the interplay between organizational form and contract structure is a necessary step in understanding why and how contracting is occurring, where and when it does.

To do that, they need to re-construct open and participative dialogue with their employees and members based on more democratic forms of communication and engagement. From this point of view, the measurement and communication of sustainability aspects may allow a dialogue to be mobilized with shareholders and stakeholders without losing the attention on competitive factors. Based on these premises, the article analyses the experience of a 5-year action research project (from 2006 to mid-2011), carried out within Unicoop Tirreno, an Italian consumers' cooperative, and aimed to implement different tools for sustainability accounting and to embrace a more open dialogue with stakeholders, in particular with employees and members. In this process of change, the tools implemented for sustainability accounting played a key role in supporting the cooperative to reinterpret its own values and in stimulating a new and participative management approach. The results indicate a virtuous circle between the management and measurement of cooperative principles and the management and measurement of sustainability issues. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This raises the question - if purely capitalist corporations are founded upon an understanding of property most in line with the theories of established property scholars Bentham and Locke, is there room for a different kind of concept of property in the realm of U.S. business? In this paper I explore the way in which the workers' cooperative model infuses a sense of moral responsibility into a group of individuals' understanding of "property" in order to create a collectively managed enterprise that measures success both in economic and socio-political terms. I first review a large body of literature on the various forms of cooperative ownership and management, focusing on the history of the co-operative model, the rights entailed under the model, and the advantages as well as criticisms associated with co-operatives. I then use this literature to situate a case study example of a co-operative organization - The Cheese Board Collective, a worker-owned artisan cheese and pizza shop in Berkeley, California - and to analyze my findings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Beginning in 1990, a series of different policies have been implemented by the Chinese government to promote farmer cooperatives (FCs). This article aims to explore the functioning of FCs on the basis of the type and scope of the services they provide and their connections with the rural communities. The findings show that activities carried out by FCs help to extend farmers' engagement in value-chain participation and management. FCs, as organizational innovations, also provide opportunities to bring knowledge providers and farmers together. Some FCs are starting to coordinate activities for farmers, rural communities and local government to make better use of collective resources. Four types of FCs are identified in the research: commoditybased FCs, community-based FCs, specialized technology providers and credit service providers. The emergence of these four types of FCs is embedded in broader institutional developments. The government mainly promotes commodity-based FCs and specialized technology-providing FCs. Companies focus on commodity-based FCs, and research institutes and development organizations are involved in community-based FCs. These findings imply that an integrated and broader view of policies is needed to promote the development of FCs in the long run. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2014.},

The poor farmers, especially those who lacked good civil morals, perceived the process chance to control the future development of the countryside. It seems most of them did not see or were not able to see the purpose of the changes in the social structure of the village, or especially the real intentions of the communists. Any manipulative ideological influence on the countryside is very harmful in its effect, and the consequences are difficult to remove even after a long period of time.

	abstract = {Soil erosion and sedimentation are natural landscape forming processes. However, they can be accelerated by human activities and therefore increase negative impacts on agricultural production as well as disturbing watershed management. Romania currently faces major environmental challenges and pressure on soil and water resources due to unsustainable farming practices and inappropriate tillage practices. The present work represents the first attempt to test the combined use of radionuclide approaches (i.e. 137Cs and 210Pbex) to quantify soil erosion changes in cultivated Transylvanian fields (Romania) at different temporal scales. Fourteen soil cores were collected along two transects in a cultivated field and two reference sites were selected to establish the mean reference inventories for both 137Cs and 210Pbex. A value of 5460±880Bqm-2 (n=10; CV=16%) was determined for the 137Cs mean reference inventory for both sites, given as areal activity±standard deviation, at 2σ confidence interval. As regarding 210Pbex reference inventory, its value (9640Bqm-2) is only given by the areal activity of one soil core from the second site. The high erosion rates obtained with the 210Pbex approach are an effect of the up and down ploughing practices which took place at the time of the local agricultural cooperative starting in the late 1950s. The middle-term redistribution rates provided by the 137Cs technique highlighted preponderant deposition processes in the field investigated, reflecting the changes in the cultivation system with ploughing across the slope at the beginning of 1990s. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a result of their historical linkages to the bureaucracy, many interests developed hierarchical, national organizational structures that enabled them to carry out a variety of vote-gathering functions that the parties had trouble performing themselves. Although electoral reform and long-term demographic trends have weakened the electoral influence of interest groups, these organizational complementarities between groups and the parties continue to matter in Japanese elections-including under conditions of two-party competition. To illustrate these points, I trace the evolution of interest group politics from the era of LDP dominance through the rise of two-party competition and the LDP's recent return to power, using postmasters associations and agricultural cooperatives as case studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the lender-borrower relationship as it relates to Sannong loans for agricultural and rural financial markets by Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCCs) and other rural lenders. This paper is motivated by recent reforms to the rural credit market designed to encourage increased lending, particularly to farmers. Little is understood about the lender-borrower relationship in rural China. This paper fills that gap. Design/methodology/approach: The paper investigates relational attitudes between 120 loan officers at RCCs in China's costal Shandong province, paired with a field survey using matched questions to 394 farm households in the same region. Pairing lenders' perception toward borrowers regarding RCC microcredit lending mechanism, against borrowers' perception toward lenders and how themselves were perceived by lenders in the same regards, the paper investigates the degree of disconnect between lenders and with distinct cluster groupings based on their perceptions, the paper analyzes the influence of demographics on the borrower and lender cluster memberships. Findings: The paper identifies four borrower clusters and two lender clusters. Borrower clusters are segmented on credit access and satisfaction with their rural lender. The paper also identifies two lender clusters, segmented principally on financial incentives and lending activities. While all lenders view farming with higher regard than farmers believe they do, one cluster is clearly pro-farmer while the second is somewhat indifferent. Indifference is more related to current portfolio activities. The paper draws conclusions that policy initiatives should be put in place at RCCs that close the gap between lender and borrower in their credit relationship. Rural lenders should concentrate on advocating RCCs' care and trust toward agriculture and farm households. At the institutional level, effort should be extended to train a dedicated team of loan officers that specialize in servicing farm households with standardized lending practices. This research provides financial institutions with outreach mechanisms to borrowers, while also training lenders to borrowers' sensitivities. Originality/value: Management studies of RCCs are few. This is the first paper that the authors are aware of that studies farmer and lender attitudes on the same scale. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The nineteenth century saw the standardization and rapid spread of the modern business corporation around the world. Yet those early corporations differed from their contemporary counterparts in important ways. Most obviously, they commonly deviated from the one-share-onevote rule that is customary today, instead adopting restricted voting schemes that favored small over large shareholders. In recent years, both legal scholars and economists have sought to explain these schemes as a rough form of investor protection, shielding small shareholders from exploitation by controlling shareholders in an era when investor protection law was weak. We argue, in contrast, that restricted voting rules generally served not to protect shareholders as investors, but to protect them as consumers. The firms adopting such rules were frequently local monopolies that provided vital infrastructural services such as transportation, banking, and insurance. The local merchants, farmers, and landholders who used these services were the firms' principal shareholders. They commonly purchased shares not in the expectation of profit, but to finance collective goods. Restricted shareholder voting assured that control of the firms' services would not fall into the hands of monopolists or competitors. In effect, the corporations had much the character of consumer cooperatives. This perspective also sheds light on the unusual importance given to the doctrine of ultra vires in the nineteenth century. While current legal and economic scholarship has focused incessantly on the separation between ownership and control, the prior separation between ownership and consumption, accomplished by the late nineteenth century, was another fundamental but generally overlooked turning point in the history of the business corporation. Understanding this transformation throws light not just on historical practices, but also on contemporary debates over deviations from the rule of one-share-one-vote.},

Hermes fervently believed that public control over industry and government would revitalize democratic institutions and eradicate political repression, institutionalized racism, and corporate capitalism. Established in 1941 as a cooperative grocery store for working-class Freret Neighborhood residents, the Consumers’ Co-operative Union (CCU) was the physical manifestation of Hermes’s utopian vision. For more than twenty years, the CCU was a space for exchanging local and national ideas about economic cooperation, racial justice, and political reform. Indeed, Hermes depended on a far-reaching New Deal support network that transcended his neighborhood and bridged political, racial, gender, and class divides. However, this coalition disintegrated in the face of white flight, anti-Communist hysteria, and urban economic decline in the 1950s. I contend that while particular depression-era neighborhood politics nurtured the CCU, larger national economic, political, and cultural trends ultimately confounded the cooperative’s ability to create sustained economic change in Freret. © 2015.

Many MFIs target women because more women than men are poor, especially in rural areas. Studies show that women manage money differently from men and have different leadership styles. Thus, in credit unions and financial firms, female and male managers achieve different results. In microfinance, gender diversity on the board of MFIs is beneficial, and loans authorized by female loan officers have lower default rates. Motivated by these findings, we ask whether MFIs with a female Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are more efficient at serving the poor without jeopardizing financial sustainability. We adapt the banking approach to managerial (in)efficiency to account for the outreach and sustainability goals of the MFIs, and evaluate whether MFIs' outreach efficiency differs by the gender of their respective CEOs. We estimate a stochastic frontier cost function using the Battese-Coelli (1995) model and the "true" random effects estimators using panel data from over 250 MFIs. We find that MFIs with female CEOs have significantly higher outreach efficiency than MFIs with male CEOs. Similar results are found with a two-step stochastic frontier approach. Overall, the results suggest that promoting gender diversity at the top levels of MFI management is likely to have both social and financial benefits. © The Author (2014).},

	abstract = {Consumer co-operatives in Korea have been growing rapidly since they launched their own shops. If co-operatives would be too much oriented to enlargement or economic growth, theymight easily pay no attention tomembers' participation which is one of the priorities in co-operatives. It could lead to losing the value of co-operatives. So it is important to adjust the balance between members' participation and economic growth. This paper focuses on the role of board of directors in doing that. It aims to examine how effectiveness of the board influences members' participation and the participation has effect on performance of co-operatives in the case of iCOOP Korea. The variables such as communication with members and usage of management skills and knowledge are employed asmeasures of the effectiveness of the board in decision-making process. The data are collected by survey the respondents of which are 222 directors of 30 primary co-operatives. It is analyzed by Structural Equation Model. The findings of the research are as follows. Firstly, communication of the board with members increases the members' democratic participation, and the increased participation contributes to improving the financial performance. Secondly, management skills and knowledge of the board does not have significant relations with the level of members' participation, even though members' economic participation has significantly positive relation with the financial performance. The findings imply that members' voluntary participation will be increased when boards of co-operatives try to reflect members' needs in the decision making processes, and it can help the co-operatives improve their financial performance. It suggests a clue for the trade-off between the value of co-operatives and growth of business which many co-operatives are trying to resolve. © 2014 The Authors.},

In this context, this paper aims to unpack the multiple, coexisting and interwoven marketing channels available for small-scale coffee producers, unveiling potential sources of uncertainty and tensions among competing actors and interests, and identifying and assessing the strategies used by organizations to influence farmers' marketing decisions. The analysis comprises two case studies based in the department of Huehuetenango (Guatemala), where the existence of distinct marketing channels combines with processes of product differentiation, namely organic production. Results show the limitations of standard fair trade mechanisms to secure farmers' engagement with cooperative organizations. Rather, technical advice to improve farming practices and quality construction seem to be a more effective mechanism to govern this collective supply chain. Nevertheless, these strategies could be further constrained by productive and organizational factors, affecting the sustainability of potential benefits delivered by these key collective actors. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

	abstract = {Purpose: There are many farmers in rural Ethiopia, who do not join cooperative societies, despite the different technical and financial supports from the government. This study thus aims to investigate the main factors that inspire rural people to join into the cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected relevant primary data from 400 sample households using a special household survey designed for this study. The study also reviewed different secondary materials. The collected data were analyzed using the two-sample t-test principle and cooperative participation probit model. Findings: The finding of the binary choice model illustrates that information access, special skill, membership in rural association, frequency of attending a public meeting/workshop, household head education, credit access, training access, number of family members in school, distance to main market, availability of infrastructures, farmland ownership and farmland sizes are the major explanatory variables that have statistically significant (p-value <0.05) influence on the rural people joining in the cooperative societies in the study areas. Research limitations/implications: This study was based on a cross-sectional survey. As a result, the finding may be subjected to some limitations though the study made all possible efforts to minimize the limitations. Practical implications: Many studies found that cooperatives are a basis for food security. Accordingly, the government can increase a number of cooperative societies in the region by giving more focus to knowledge- and awareness-based instruments like education, information center, rural associations, communication services and roads. These campaigns can attract more people to join the cooperatives and then get the different economic and social advantages from the cooperatives in order to ensure household food security. Originality/value: Some studies found that state, leadership, success history of the cooperative and autonomous status are the most important factors that determine not only the expansion of cooperatives in terms of a number of and types but also for the success of the cooperatives. This study, however, found the importance of information- and knowledge-based mechanisms as a basis to attract more people so that increase in a number of and types of the cooperative societies. Thus, the result of the study is significant for policy makers, social science students, researchers and cooperative societies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Ruth First was an important commentator on the Alexandra Bus Boycott of 1957, in which the author participated. Some 20 years later, the author was recruited by First to the CEA, where he worked with Ruth First and others on labour migration, forced labour and on the newly established communal villages and agricultural producer cooperatives. First, although heavily involved in administration, nevertheless managed to find time for fieldwork of this kind. The author contributed to ongoing fieldwork at the CEA, and his results were fed into the teaching through his contribution of interviews, work songs and other material for the Mozambican Miner, later published as Black Gold. Examples are given of the directness of Ruth's criticisms, and of her sympathy for ordinary Mozambicans. The article concludes with recollections of responses made to the author on Ruth's death. © 2014 ROAPE Publications Ltd.},

	abstract = {Within a context of known and alarming deterioration of water bodies and under pressure from the European Water Framework Directive, in 2009 the French government designated slightly more than 500 priority catchments. In so doing, it declared its objective of concentrating its efforts on these areas, trying out a methodology for action, and proving to the European Union that it was taking action. The present study has documented the on-going situations and actions on these Grenelle catchment areas and identified the broad types of actions and situations as part of a critical analysis of the approach retained by the government. After constructing an analytical framework of these areas, we assembled together a large collection of data to be analyzed with multivariate statistical analysis. These data were either gathered from surveys based on a questionnaire encompassing biophysical, agricultural, social, and economic aspects or based on spatialized statistical data sources. This work demonstrates key factors characterizing the catchment areas: the hydrological entry point for the definition of a field of action involves great variability of territorial size and therefore of the players involved (municipalities, farmers, cooperatives, users). Little attention is given to this aspect in the relatively rigid single legal procedure presently in force. On these catchment areas, we emphasize two main lines of structuring parameters: on the one hand, the relative diversity of land use and forms of agriculture, and on the other, the relative strength of the administrative structure. These results could be useful for those managing these issues in the different government agencies, those implementing the approaches, or local authorities responsible for resource management, as they provide a better understanding of how to adapt these experiments to other areas concerned by water resource issues. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Cantarranas presents high degree of marginalization, limited access to health services, and few opportunities to increase its economic income. The aim was to design a strategy for the sustainable harvesting and conservation of medicinal plants used by the community, as an alternative to solve social and environmental problems. The species were evaluated by ethnobotanical and ecological methods. Using structured interviews, index of cultural value, index of Friedman value, practices and management intensity, and uses and conditions treated were documented. The distribution and abundance were obtained with line transects method. Nineteen plants were evaluated, they are used to treat 51 conditions; the gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently treated with medicinal plants. The species with the higher index of cultural value were Equisetum myriochaetum (0.69), Psidium guajava (0.37), Jaegeria macrocephala (0.26) y Costus scaber (0.25). Hamelia patens recorded the highest level of fi delity (96[%]), followed by E. myriochaetum (88[%]). The values of management intensity are higher in species such as C. scaber (9.2) y P. guajava (9). The population density has a range between 1 and 387 individuals per hectare, depending on the species and life forms. Through linking society and University, we developed and offered a certifi ed program for members of the community related to the use and sustainable harvesting of medicinal plants. A Cooperative Society was incorporated with women of the community and they work in the conservation and sustainable harvesting of medicinal plants in the community.},

This study investigates why different producers make different choices, looking at both material and immaterial costs and benefits of the two choices. A qualitative study from Chiapas (Mexico) finds that a main reason for not choosing the co-operatives is the production requirements that follow organic certification. A survey on production costs confirms that members of an organic co-operative have more work hours than non-members in the same area. A probit analysis indicates that both coffee plot size and number of working household members influence the producers’ decision on sales channel. However, the study also finds that aspects not related to the organic production requirements can affect the choice, such as the level of trust in co-operative leadership, and the co-operatives’ payment systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

In order to study the marketing margin, the data were collected on different aspects viz., chilling charges, transportation cost and commission to milk collection cooperative societies, water and electricity charges, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and interest on capital expenditure from Jaipur Dairy Plant. The data were arranged in simple tabular form, and then simple averages and percentages were computed. It was found that product-wise highest margin was received from ghee (29.26%) and agencies-wise highest margin was also received from ghee which formed 76% of the total margins earned by distributors.

An interview was therefore conducted with Sérgio Niza, founder and head at the Centro de Formação de Professores and at Escola Moderna, a journal, both of which are connected to Movimento da Escola Moderna. The editorial work was done by Julio Groppa Aquino, an associate professor at Faculdade de Educação da Universidade de São Paulo. Through the in loco dialogue between interviewer and interviewee in September 2012, a sort of historic record comes forth, along with a critical-analytical one, about questions that have been essential to school practice since the return of democracy in Portugal in the 1970s and that seem to match in so many aspects the Brazilian situation and its peculiar inflections. With Movimento da Escola Moderna as the core subject of the interview, Sérgio Niza brings up the proposal of creating spaces for collective training management focused on theoretical-practical reflection about the pedagogic everyday life, offering also a sharp evaluation of the Portuguese education in the last few decades. Moreover, the interview brings us a timely reflection on Escola da Ponte (the Portuguese experience that is best known among Brazilians), as well as lucid considerations about contemporary Brazil, exhorting it to "go much further" in education.},

Using a time-varying probability regime-switching model and monthly data (2000M9-2012M3), we identify two very distinctive regimes: a low mark-up regime (R1) and a high mark-up regime (R2). Without setting any given date a priori, the results from both the regime-switching approach and a sequential search method indicate that the spread exhibits a significant upward shift around early 2008 for all lenders. The estimated switching model controls for the rising wholesale funding costs and changes in global consumer confidence over the sample period. The results show that building societies are generally less inclined to remain in R2 than most banks (particularly foreign subsidiary banks) and some credit unions, and are consequently more likely to offer competitive mortgages to borrowers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The degradation of product quality is one form of rent dissipation resulting from incomplete property rights in fisheries. Industry structure and information asymmetries can also lead to underinvestment in product quality, even when property rights are well defined. In this article we empirically examine whether the voluntary formation of a marketing cooperative was able to mitigate market failures that led to the production of inferior-quality fish. Specifically, we use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to measure the impact that the Copper River Fishermen's Cooperative, an Alaskan salmon marketing cooperative, had on ex-vessel salmon prices and salmon quality measures. We find that the cooperative was able to improve product quality, as well as attract and sustain a higher price for its salmon. Our findings provide empirical support for many of the key tenets of cooperative theory. Specifically, we find evidence that marketing cooperatives can address existing market failures, that marketing cooperatives can have advantages in high-quality product markets, and that over time, as a result of their success, marketing cooperatives may lead to lasting producer benefits even though they become obsolete due to nonmember free-riding. © The Author (2014).},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine how heads of small charitable performing arts organisations who did not possess backgrounds or qualifications in marketing interpreted the implications, for future marketing activities, of significant cuts in government funding and how their views on the value of marketing changed consequent to the cuts. Design/methodology/approach: Dervin's sensemaking interview method was employed to explore the processes, whereby the heads of 26 small nonprofit contemporary dance companies made sense of the marketing demands of newly constrained funding situations. Findings: Three groups of respondents were identified, respectively, labelled as marketing reductionists, knowledge seekers, and marketing activists. Many of the respondents did not distinguish between marketing and human resource management functions. Major confusions existed vis-à-vis pricing policies and how to evaluate returns on marketing expenditures. Research limitations/implications: The study covered a single sector in just one country. Replication of the study in other sectors and countries would be worthwhile, as would the comparison of how small arts companies deal with various other types of financial crisis. Practical implications: National bodies that award performing arts qualifications need to include marketing in their curricula and syllabuses. Arts marketing associations should make available on their web sites instructional materials relating to marketing. The government should encourage the formation of marketing co-operatives among small performing arts companies. Originality/value: The study applied a qualitative interview technique unfamiliar to most researchers in the marketing field. It was the first to investigate the impact of cutbacks in government funding on the interpretations of marketing held by heads of small arts organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

When a producer cooperative hires wageworkers or welcomes outside directors, one can no longer call that enterprise simply communist or capitalist. Such conflicting relations of production confront enterprise directors with a complex array of distribution pressures. Coexisting class structures create unique tensions between managers, merchants, and other revenue recipients. These contradictions can transform the nature of work. Although the concept of the hybrid has been recognized in class analysis, a systematic study of its forms and dynamics has yet to be developed. A theory of hybrid-directed enterprises reveals that communist class structures can be a spontaneous and successful enterprise component, as well as a catalyst for change today. © 2014, Association for Economic and Social Analysis.},

Based on Transaction Cost Economics, we develop a theoretical framework seeking to explain preferences for electricity supplied by cooperatives from a consumer perspective. Drawing on a convenience sample of 287 German electricity consumers and Choice Experiment data from an online survey, we estimate Willingness-to-Pay values for organizational attributes of electricity suppliers, while accounting for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Consumers in the sample exhibit a large Willingness-to-Pay for renewable energy. Our results also indicate a substantial Willingness-to-Pay for transparent pricing, participation in decision making, and local suppliers. Democratic decision making - a distinct feature of cooperatives - exhibits positive Willingness-to-Pay values for approximately one fifth of the sample. Taken together, our findings suggest a slightly higher Willingness-to-Pay for electricity produced by cooperatives.

The main objective of the study was to identify and analyse factors affecting (constraints) marketing of vegetables among small-scale farmers. Data were collected with structured questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and regression analysis. Results showed that prominent constraints of marketing vegetables among the small-scale farmers were: lack of access to credit, lack of access to storage facilities, lack of market information, lack of finance for farming, poorly developed village markets, poor producer prices, high perishability of produce, low patronage, inadequate access roads, small size of transport and high transportation costs. Variables that significantly influenced monthly net farm income were: gender (t = 3.913), farm size (t = 4.100), number of employees (t = 6.126), access to storage (t =-2.132), grading of products (t = 3.712) and access to extension services (t = 1.757). Recommendations suggested include: enabling accessibility through the development of better infrastructure in the form of storage facilities, roads for transportation and communication systems; and the formation of marketing cooperatives to overcome high transportation costs, small size of transport and individual small marketing output problems in order to attract and penetrate high value-markets. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.},

It proposes an anthropological approach that critically analyzes divisions of labor and the internal factions’ divergent concepts of “community”. In Sicily, workers in “anti-Mafia” co-ops recognize a sense of community and “way of life” in Mafia-influenced mobilizations outside the cooperative environment, contrary to the co-op administrators’ legalistic views of community.

	abstract = {A whole genome association (WGA) study was carried out to find quantitative trait loci (QTL) for sensory evaluation traits in Hanwoo. Carcass samples of 250 Hanwoo steers were collected from National Agricultural Cooperative Livestock Research Institute, Ansung, Gyeonggi province, Korea, between 2011 and 2012 and genotyped with the Affymetrix Bovine Axiom Array 640K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Among the SNPs in the chip, a total of 322,160 SNPs were chosen after quality control tests. After adjusting for the effects of age, slaughter-year-season, and polygenic effects using genome relationship matrix, the corrected phenotypes for the sensory evaluation measurements were regressed on each SNP using a simple linear regression additive based model. A total of 1,631 SNPs were detected for color, aroma, tenderness, juiciness and palatability at 0.1% comparison-wise level. Among the significant SNPs, the best set of 52 SNP markers were chosen using a forward regression procedure at 0.05 level, among which the sets of 8, 14, 11, 10, and 9 SNPs were determined for the respectively sensory evaluation traits. The sets of significant SNPs explained 18% to 31% of phenotypic variance. Three SNPs were pleiotropic, i.e. AX-26703353 and AX-26742891 that were located at 101 and 110 Mb of BTA6, respectively, influencing tenderness, juiciness and palatability, while AX-18624743 at 3 Mb of BTA10 affected tenderness and palatability. Our results suggest that some QTL for sensory measures are segregating in a Hanwoo steer population. Additional WGA studies on fatty acid and nutritional components as well as the sensory panels are in process to characterize genetic architecture of meat quality and palatability in Hanwoo.

	abstract = {The cooperative movement in Venezuela reached unprecedented levels of growth with the adoption of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (1999) and the Cooperatives Act (2001). By 2006 there were 108,000 cooperatives, and the figure rose to 306,792 in 2011 estimated that by 2013 only about 40,000 will survive, mainly due to the lack of consideration of associated labor and other cooperative values. These data justify the need to analyze the cooperative principles in the success of agricultural cooperatives in Zulia State. The research was conducted in the counties located at the South of Maracaibo’s Lake, a questionnaire to 51 cooperatives and interview to cooperative specialists were applied. Overall rate of success factors (IGFE), index review of success factors (IOE), and the index of productive activities (IAP) which have been subjected to correlation and means tests: success rates were constructed. The results emphasize that the principles with high average values and statistical significance in successful cooperatives are democratic management (0.7059), equal economic participation of partners (0.5233), education, training and information (0.4560), cooperation between cooperatives (0.4882) and commitment to the communities (0.3331). A significant correlation (P<0.01) between the IGFE (0.598) and IOE (0.598) with the dependent variable IAP was observed. It was concluded that the application of cooperative principles in the constitution and organization of cooperatives has been a condition of success. © 2014 Universidad del Zulia.

Following the 2008 financial crisis, ethical banks have expanded markedly. Some suggest that this growth is opportunist in nature and reasoned in the public's disenfranchment with commercial banks. However, this paper seeks to demonstrate how British EBs have been, and remain, connected to social movements and civil society organisations (CSOs). It employs a mixed-method approach to review EB coverage in media and to explore three UK-based EBs' connections with CSOs via Social Network Analysis, with the aim to compare them to, and contrast them from, building societies, credit unions and other alternative banks. The link between EBs and CSOs were further examined in interviews with EBs. Findings support the idea of EBs in the UK as countermovement by highlighting how connections with CSOs constrain EBs behaviour, but at the same time give EBs privileged access to niche markets. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study was to, using a case study research design informed by organizational economics theory, to examine the prospects for micro-insurance in promoting micro-credit in a low-income Anglophone country in sub-Saharan Africa – The Gambia. Two main research questions are addressed: first, what is the most appropriate micro-finance institution (MFI) organizational structure to maximize the economic benefits of micro-insurance? Second, what are the financial management and wider economic benefits of the use of micro-insurance by MFIs? Design/methodology/approach – To address our two research questions, we used a semi-structured interview protocol, informed by the organizational economics literature, to interpret the data collected from our field cases. We believe that these intrinsic qualities of case study methodology are particularly apt in the present study, given the complex and emergent nature of micro-finance and micro-insurance in low-income countries such The Gambia. By focusing on case studies in a single country, we also to some extent help control for variations in business environment that could confound interpretations of field data obtained from different jurisdictions. Findings – The results of our study suggest that the mutual (cooperative) structure of credit unions is likely to be the most cost-efficient and effective organizational form for reducing information asymmetries, agency problems and transaction costs. We also observe that micro-insurance can help reduce the risk of loan defaults, thereby increasing returns on savings and lowering the costs of debt. As such, micro-insurance stimulates the demand–supply of financial intermediation in less developed countries and so helps promote economic development. In addition to contributing new insights, our findings have potentially important commercial and public policy implications. Research limitations/implications – We acknowledge that our research is subject to inherent limitations such as the focus on three interviews in three different types of MFI organization while excluding other structural forms of organization such as government-owned/sponsored organizations. Nonetheless, the organizational characteristics of the cases examined in the present study are representative of most MFIs in developing countries. Given the prevalent hierarchical nature of corporate systems in sub-Saharan Africa, the views of the interviewees are also deemed to reflect those of other board members. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the conclusions from our research may need to be tempered in line with these inherent limitations with the research approach adopted. Practical implications – The insights obtained from our Gambia-based research could be generalized to developing countries elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, and indeed, other parts of the developing world. Consequently, the study could be of interest and relevance to international financiers (e.g. the World Bank), aid agencies, governments and other development organizations. Originality/value – Despite its evident business and development potential, academic management research on micro-insurance, and in particular, its role in supporting micro-finance initiatives, is still very much at an embryonic stage. Our study thus seeks to fill this knowledge gap. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In this paper the economics of seasonal production of cheese in the mountain in Norway is investigated and compared with keeping the cows at the farm, investing in a common pasture or in co-operative dairy farming. The comparison is based on calculations in a linear programming (LP) farm model supported with Stochastic Dominance with Respect to a Function (SDRF) for risk analysis. Mountain dairy farming involves free ranging cows on natural pastures for about 70 days. The contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, CLA and various antioxidants in the milk increase when cows graze alpine pastures affecting its processing properties, and flavor and chemical content of dairy products. Seasonal mountain cheese production is found to be generally preferable to the other alternatives for risk neutral as well as risk-averse decision makers. This is due to a higher price for mountain products, subsidy payments for mountain farming, and exemption for farm processed milk in the national milk quota. The risks are partly price risks but also yield and output risks as well as downside political risks since the profitability depend strongly on subsidies and premiums, and exemption for farmprocessed milk in the milk quota. Investments in farming co-operatives were unprofitable due to less subsidy payments compared to individual farmers. Effects of calving time, introducing fertilized pastures or night pens, and supplementary feeding to extend the mountain period and sustain milk yields are examined. The premium price for "mountain products", animal welfare, and farmer co-operation on marketing are discussed.},

The prior importance of institutions built around the use and management of collective resources is explored as an alternative proxy for social capital in pre-industrial economies. The results show that the social networks built around common lands and irrigation communities were a key element, together with relatively high levels of human capital and the existence of a wide layer of middle size farms, in facilitating the emergence of the cooperative movement in rural areas. © 2012 European Historical Economics Society.},

The empirical study takes as a reference the horticultural sector in southeast Spain, since this area constitutes the highest concentration of small-scale farm production in Europe, where the climatic conditions allow the possibility of several harvests in year-round production, as well as several alternative crops. Firstly, we study the production programming for an individual farmer, under the assumption that their decisions do not affect the balance of market prices. In this case a modified Markowitz model is used for the scheduling of crop marketing. Secondly, we study the sales arrangements for a farming-marketing cooperative, under the assumption that their sales volume is such that the entity is capable of altering the market balance. A model of monthly revenues and margins is proposed, and the results show a clear improvement in both margins and revenues if the harvest is programmed in this way. © 2011 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).},

The selection of enterprises has been implemented on base of differentness in the enterprise form, in the acreage of managed farm land and a differentiation of the enterprise subject. From a comparison of volume and structure of the supports it results that an agricultural cooperative uses a wide spectrum of particular types of subsidies, which is caused by a big acreage of almost 7 800 ha with orientation to both the plant and the animal productions. Similar situation is in the valued joint-stock company. Without received subsidies the economy of private farmer would be unprofitable in both the years. In monitoring it was proved that differentiation of enterprise activity in form of raw material process in excess of framework of agricultural basic industry decreases dependence of the income from operations on obtained financial means in form of supports. From the mentioned facts it is obvious that the received financial subsidies significantly positively influenced the operating results of all agricultural enterprises where the basic activity subject is plant and animal production.

Th e paper aims at a better understanding what market conditions and transaction attributes have favoured the emergence and the success of the Czech milk marketing cooperatives as well as if their current objectives and strategies are suffi cient for securing their future success. Th e methodological approach rests largely in the theory of industrial organisation combined with the new institutional economics. Establishing marketing cooperatives, dairy farmers balanced market power with processing industry. It is showed on six case studies that the Czech milk marketing cooperatives follow traditional objectives (securing sales, fair price and payment discipline); however, their priorities and strategies diff er according to their market environment.

Their development has been strongly influenced by the external environment and political approaches to cooperative promotion. Although farmer cooperatives have developed rapidly in China in the last three years, progress has not been uniform across the provinces, due to differences in farmer education levels and varying economic and social situations. In order to identify factors for the successful development of farmer cooperatives in Northwest China, two cases of provincially approved successful farmer cooperatives in Shandan county of Gansu province were chosen for this research. The results revealed that a stable legal environment; a dedicated initiator and leader; government financial and technical support; farmer understanding and participation of cooperative activities and appropriate external support from professional NGOs were the key factors for the successful development of farmer cooperatives in Northwest of China. This study also found some challenges that farmer cooperatives have faced in their development.

Members normally share their experiences and discuss how to solve their current existing social and economic problems and finally come up with appropriate solutions for their benefits, as well as for the benefit of the community.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper will first address how brands have enclosed quality signs and even more, how consumers respond to it. Then, it will examine to what extent Greek Agricultural Cooperatives have developed brands for their products and whether they have used quality systems in their activities. Thus, the starting point in the paper's argument is that Agricultural Cooperatives have been slow to develop brands while consumers have been displaying a positive attitude towards these products. Findings - This work suggests a solution to overcome the difficulties and drawbacks associated with the notion "cooperative product" and to compare its similarities with a collective brand, which has been previously proposed as a brand development strategy for the Agricultural Cooperatives. Practical implications - The development of a Quality System especially designed for agricultural cooperatives' products and, in combination with product certification, can be used as a part of their brand strategy. Originality/value - Agricultural cooperatives could build a brand development strategy based on quality systems, Total Quality Management elements and hence attain the benefits associated with their implementation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, many self-governance initiatives proceed with difficulty, particularly when these initiatives conflict with established rules and institutions. This paper addresses the question of the extent to which, and under what conditions, self-governance initiatives can become successful in heavily regulated policy fields. It, therefore, analyses a self-governance initiative by a Dutch farmers' association from two theoretical perspectives: Ostrom's institutional design principles and insights from the politics of self-governance. Whereas, Ostrom's principles focus on arranging interactions between the members of a self-governing community and their common resources, the focus of the politics literature is on the negotiations between the community and the governmental authorities to obtain room for self-governance. The paper reveals how the arrangements within the association influenced the negotiation between this community and the involved authorities, and vice versa. This mutual relationship can both positively and negatively influence the accomplishment of self-governance. Adequate self-governance arrangements can help to convince policy-makers to provide room in existing policies to accommodate self-governance. Conversely, policy-makers can help to set conditions for designing successful arrangements. Otherwise, both processes can negatively reinforce each other, and this can result in stalemates and blockades. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The inquiry offers what we consider to be the first synthesis of the evolution of Romanian cooperatives from the perspective of social economy. The article presents relevant information for understanding and explaining the conditions that facilitated both successes and failures of rural and urban cooperatives in Romania. The study reveals an unprecedented aspect of cooperatives precursors associated to the pre modern trade and with the precursors of the merchants that operate on the capitalist market, the fact that they had a fundamental moral resource: the mutual trust of the stakeholder partners. The capitalist merchants involved in mass trade that would eventually form a consistent part of the Romanian cooperative members would have been rather interested to gain money, to surpass the problems of the competition, than to cultivate with priority the principles of honesty, fair play, mutual trust, as part of the professional ethos. Thus, a moral resource indispensable to business, part of the moral profile of the cooperative stakeholders, available in the practice of the middle class precursors, was no longer as resuscitated and converted into social capital of the merchants and manufacturers confronting on the free market, being partly lost on the way. The precarious state of agricultural productivity was a poor source of expansion for the cooperative associations. The most visible expression of the absence of major stimulants for the development of the cooperative movement in agriculture was the presence of an explosive germ within the rural social structure where over 80% of the active population worked: the absolute majority (51.1%) of the auxiliary members of the families of agricultural workers and the relative majority consisting of the self-employed small agricultural workers (34.3%). The practice of subsistence agriculture within a family system with an active population overwhelmingly consisting of the family members that are helping the household head to perform a primate exploitation of the land drastically limited the opportunities to build and consolidate a vigorous cooperative movement. We discuss arguments presented by recognized experts concerning the identity of cooperatives as an institution of social economy: its finalities, relations between the normative state and the cooperative autonomy, types and frequencies of cooperative units, levels of participation of village and urban population to the cooperative movement. The article proposes a starting point for a debate concerning cooperation in relation to the dynamic of population needs, comparing cooperative politics versus real associative life, in the problematic context of social economy. We question the links between credit co operations, economic (production) co operations and the country level of economic development. We also bring into question the hopeless situation of the small agricultor on the market of agricultural products. We discuss the effect of administrative tutelage on cooperation, as well as a series of durable management deficits in the life of cooperative organizations. The study sheds light on limitations of cooperative autonomy due to interventions of powerful social actors.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of rural electrification through extension of existing grid on rural micro-enterprises in Niger Delta, Nigeria. The study used purposive sampling and obtained data using structured questionnaires and personal interviews with the owners of the micro-enterprises. From the data, summary information was obtained and the impact of connection to grid-electricity on the micro-enterprises was examined using a log-linear regression model. The result shows that although not statistically significant, on average, enterprises in communities connected to the electricity grid are 16.2% more profitable than enterprises in communities not connected to the grid, and the use of generating sets in providing back-up electricity makes micro-enterprises more profitable. The study also observed that micro-enterprise owners are fully aware of the importance of electricity access to the profitability of their businesses and those who can afford to buy generating sets willingly do so. Incidentally, the total expenditure on generating sets by some enterprises is up to three times (3. ×) the tariff for grid-electricity in rural areas. The high cost of self-generated electricity increases the total cost of doing business in rural areas thus reducing the profit margin of the micro-enterprises. In conclusion, for rural electrification to be more effective in improving the living standard of rural dwellers, the larger problem of increasing the national generating capacity and the availability of grid-electricity should be tackled, and rural electrification programs should be carried out alongside other programs that reduce the barriers to establishing micro-enterprises like the creation of rural agricultural co-operatives to promote the productive use of electricity. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This article explores the views of Smallholder Marketing Cooperatives' (SMCs) leaders and staff, to gain insight about the particular roles SMCs play in facilitating smallholders' market access.Design/methodology/approach: The authors conceptualized and executed two international workshops in which participants from 42 SMCs from 24 countries deliberated their lessons learned from real-life experiences.Findings: Participants defined three core issues to be tackled by SMCs to play their role related to facilitating their members' market access: good FO governance and management; access to capital and networking. They highlighted that smallholders' market access improves not only as a result of SMCs networking and negotiation with key actors in the public and private sectors, but also due to improved interrelationships among SMCs and other types of Farmers' Organizations (FOs). Peer-to-peer relationships with other SMCs are critical for mutual learning, collaboration and collective action.Practical implications: Peer-to-peer relationships among SMCs are crucial for them to overcome the internal and external social dilemmas SMCs are bound to face while improving smallholders' market access. This goes beyond the three kinds of relationships that scholars have pointed out thus far needed for effective FO development (relationships with members; the public sector and civil society; and with market players). This can be promoted and supported by development programmes.Originality/value: Most SMC studies concentrate primarily on their efficiency in production and marketing activities. This research proposes looking beyond this perspective, using a qualitative approach to explore the real-life experiences and views of actors involved. © 2012 Copyright Wageningen University.},

	abstract = {Materials with strong correlations are prone to spin and charge instabilities, driven by Coulomb, magnetic, and lattice interactions. In materials that have significant localized and itinerant spins, it is not obvious which will induce order. We combine electrical transport, X-ray magnetic diffraction, and photoemission studies with band structure calculations to characterize successive antiferromagnetic transitions in GdSi. GdSi has both sizable local moments and a partially nested Fermi surface, without confounding contributions from orbital effects. We identify a route to incommensurate order where neither type of moment dominates, but is rooted in cooperative feedback between them. The nested Fermi surface of the itinerant electrons induces strong interactions between local moments at the nesting vector, whereas the ordered local moments in turn provide the necessary coupling for a spindensity wave to form among the itinerant electrons. This mechanism echoes the cooperative interactions between electrons and ions in charge-density-wave materials, and should be germane across a spectrum of transition-metal and rare-earth intermetallic compounds.},

For that, a study case was promoted regarding the Rural Credit Cooperative of Sugarcane Suppliers and Cattle Farmers in the Piracicaba Region (Cocrefocapi). The main objective is to show the importance of Cocrefocapi to finance sugarcane suppliers from Piracicaba, analyzing the influence of some factors in the decision of sugarcane suppliers, in order to choose this cooperative as the main financing institution. Two econometric models of qualitativeresponse and a set of descriptive analysis were developed in this study. Results show that the land size is one factor which should be included when the demand for agricultural credit is analyzed. In addition, the econometric evidence shows that, bigger participation in the institutional capital of Cocrefocapi is not a factor which incentives members to borrow money in this Cooperative. On the other hand, although sugarcane suppliers who took loans in Cocrefocapi have chosen this institution because of lower transaction costs, results demonstrate that many of these people took loans in other institutions because they had other economic activities, which are not financed by Cocrefocapi.},

This paper contributes to the economic theory of the cooperative organization by examining it from a comparative economic perspective. Departing from Williamson's one-dimensional continuum of governance structures, the paper adopts the view that governance structures exhibit multiple dimensions and true hybrids are market-like on some of these dimensions while hierarchy-like on others. I show that the cooperative blends market-like attributes with hierarchy-like mechanisms and thus should be viewed as a true hybrid rather than as an intermediate form.

Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members.

First, despite the help and support by the government, the cooperative sector has not been able to play a major role in the development of the country and its share has not exceeded 3% of development program. The main aim of this study is identifying the factors affecting the participation of Shirvan-Chardavol township’s agricultural cooperatives’ members.; Approach: This casual comparative applied research which uses survey method for data accumulation, is of Quasi-experimental research type because of impossibility of controlling the research variables. A researcher-made questionnair was used as the main tool for gathering data. The face and content validity of the questionnaire were confirmed by a group of university professors and cooperative experts; also the reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed through calculating the Kronbach alfa coefficient (a = 0.80).; Results: The statistical society of the research included 751 active members of Shirvan-Chardavol township’s agricultural cooperatives, among which 260 people were selected for the study using classified proportional random sampling method and with the aid of Morgan sample-volume table. Data processing was performed using SPSS estatistial software, as well as descriptive estatistics (central and inferential indexes) and analytical estatistics (correlation coefficients and stepwise multiple regression analysis).; Conclusion: The correlation coefficient results show that there is significant relationship between the variables like age, background history of membership in cooperatives, the members’ agricultural land areas, annual income of the members, socio-cultural features, economical features, educational-extensional features, managerial factors, psychological features, political factors and communicational-informational factors from the one hand and the dependent variable of agricultural cooperatives’ members’ level of participation from the other. The multiple regression analysis results showed that variables like political, economic, managerial and social factors have positive effect on the dependent variable of agricultural cooperatives’ members’ participation, describing 65% of the changes of the mentioned dependent variable. © 2011 Science Publications.},

It was found that in agreement with Olson's theory, the number of members of the body had a statistically significant positive relationship with the life (between formation and dissolution) of the co-operative body. In addition, it was also found that factors that affected the opportunity cost of maintaining status quo, including the value of the land on which the co-op scheme sits and the real option value of redevelopment, had a significant impact on the timing of the dissolution of the co-op.

Design/methodology/approach: Oliver proposed an innovative framework to explain the relationships between satisfaction, loyalty, fortitude, and a sense of community. Findings: Analysis of questionnaire responses of 493 customers of banks and credit unions indicated that satisfaction, cognitive, affective, conative, and action loyalty are positively related to fortitude. Research limitations/implications: The Beyond Loyalty Model (BLM) does not address important strategic issues often associated with loyalty, such as firm profitability, complaint resolution, and firm profitability. Practical implications: This research is the first to find that customers of financial institutions acquire satisfaction and strong loyalty ties with their bank or credit union after dealing with their financial services provider for a relatively short period of time. Thus financial institutions should consistently seek relationship-building opportunities from the outset of their relationships with their customers.

	abstract = {Between 1950 and 2010, the British co-operative movement faced a series of commercial, structural, and corporate governance crises. Having pioneered many of the features of modern large-scale retailing since its origins in the mid-nineteenth century, from the 1950s the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) and the retail cooperative societies it served experienced plummeting market share, continued internecine rivalries, and increasing marginalization. In the early twenty-first century, however, co-operatives improved their market share and experienced a Renaissance in commercial fortunes despite continued fierce competition in food retailing. As yet there has been little exploration of the nature of this turnaround and the ways in which the once-foundering co-operative business model was re-engineered.Drawing on new research into the CWS (renamed The Co-operative Group in 2001), this article provides a historical analysis of the movement's decline and revival. As the article details, from the 1950s significant efforts were made to reform CWS and the movement as a whole. However, co-operatives were slow to adapt to the changing business environment, hampered by dysfunctional organizational dynamics that constrained structural change and limited efforts to compete with private retail multiples. Following an unsuccessful takeover bid for CWS in 1997, co-operative opinion coalesced around the need for change. In the final section, the authors analyze the factors underpinning the Renaissance, focusing on both organizational innovations and the reassertion of core values and principles on which co-operation had been built. This provides a fascinating illustration of how a business can respond effectively to internal and external challenges, yet retain its fundamental character. © 2013 The Author.},

	abstract = {In the 1990s, an expansion of small-scale (farm) forestry in medium to low rainfall areas was considered to be an important part of increasing the national forest estate but it remains a very minor source of timber, largely confined to the higher rainfall areas. In most areas, returns from timber are much less than for alternative land uses, even with low discount rates. If however, there are additional returns from plantation grazing and carbon sequestration and there are other potential management gains, multiple use plantations may be more attractive. The goal of this study is to estimate the net present values of multiple use spotted gum plantations in a medium rainfall area of southeast Queensland. For the case study, production, carbon sequestration and emissions data were supplemented by formal and informal interviews with landholders, sawmill staff and government extension personnel. Forest inventory, biomass and soil sampling, and stakeholder interviews were used as sources of primary data. The costs and benefits data were converted into monetary terms and discounted to produce net present values. Evaluations in this study identify the optimal rotation age of plantations to be 33-34 years. This is the case if including carbon and stock values, and using either farm- or factory-gate timber prices. The net present value increases significantly however if farmers harvest the trees themselves. In addition, at harvesting age, it was found that carbon and stock had the potential to account for 19.2 and 11.4% respectively of the total returns from spotted gum plantations. Policy initiatives to support the farm forestry sub-sector should include pricing greenhouse gas emissions and developing and strengthening farmers co-operatives and marketing institutions to enhance farmers' bargaining power. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

According to the results it can be seen that the real motivation for the development of cooperatives is farmers’ demands and the demands come from farmers’ pursuit of interests in forest industry. Cooperatives in China are still in the early stage of development, and the cooperative laws cannot cover all the basic features of the forestry and the cooperatives. Therefore, the relevant laws and guarantee systems for resource exploitation and management, publicity and demonstration, forestry technology training as well as the preferential policies such as tax breaks, are needed for the sound development of China’s forestry cooperation organization. © 2013 Estonian University of Life Sciences.

	abstract = {This article explores the women weavers of Manipur by using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. In mainstream India, males play the major role in weaving while women are involved in pre-weaving activity. In contrast to this, in the north-eastern states of India, especially Manipur, the weaving occupation is dominated by women, who often perform the dual roles of producer and trader. There are no power looms or cloth mills in the state even today, and these women weavers are to be credited for preserving Manipur's heritage by laboriously producing traditional textiles by hand. Globalisation and the opening of global markets may require their skills and knowledge to be upgraded to face the competition, and this study is an attempt to understand the world of the women weavers of Manipur in the context of a changing society. Their integral role in an industrially backward state is reflected in the lives of the 300 women selected for this study, which examines their socioeconomic conditions; the advantages and disadvantages associated with their working conditions; aspects of their health, wages and aspirations; their social relations with family and community; as well as the changing market structure, the technology used and production. Thus, an exploration of the women weavers' lives becomes a matter of acknowledging their contribution to society in the performance of their duties and roles according to their capacity, culture and traditions. © 2012 SAGE Publications.},

	abstract = {In negotiations over land-right acquisitions, landowners have an informational advantage over conservation groups because they know more about the opportunity costs of conservation measures on their sites. This advantage creates the possibility that landowners will demand payments greater than the required minimum, where this minimum required payment is known as the landowner's willingness to accept (WTA). However, in recent studies of conservation costs, researchers have assumed landowners will accept conservation with minimum payments. We investigated the ability of landowners to demand payments above their WTA when a conservation group has identified multiple sites for protection. First, we estimated the maximum payment landowners could potentially demand, which is set when groups of landowners act as a cooperative. Next, through the simulation of conservation auctions, we explored the amount of money above landowners' WTA (i.e., surplus) that conservation groups could cede to secure conservation agreements, again investigating the influence of landowner cooperatives. The simulations showed the informational advantage landowners held could make conservation investments up to 42% more expensive than suggested by the site WTAs. Moreover, all auctions resulted in landowners obtaining payments greater than their WTA; thus, it may be unrealistic to assume landowners will accept conservation contracts with minimum payments. Of particular significance for species conservation, conservation objectives focused on overall species richness, which therefore recognize site complementarity, create an incentive for landowners to form cooperatives to capture surplus. To the contrary, objectives in which sites are substitutes, such as the maximization of species occurrences, create a disincentive for cooperative formation. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.},

	abstract = {Self-interest frequently causes individuals engaged in joint enterprises to choose actions that are counterproductive. Free-riders can invade a society of cooperators, causing a tragedy of the commons. Such social dilemmas can be overcome by positive or negative incentives. Even though an incentive-providing institution may protect a cooperative society from invasion by free-riders, it cannot always convert a society of free-riders to cooperation. In the latter case, both norms, cooperation and defection, are stable: To avoid a collapse to full defection, cooperators must be sufficiently numerous initially. A society of free-riders is then caught in a social trap, and the institution is unable to provide an escape, except at a high, possibly prohibitive cost. Here, we analyze the interplay of (a) incentives provided by institutions and (b) the effects of voluntary participation. We show that this combination fundamentally improves the efficiency of incentives. In particular, optional participation allows institutions punishing free-riders to overcome the social dilemma at a much lower cost, and to promote a globally stable regime of cooperation. This removes the social trap and implies that whenever a society of cooperators cannot be invaded by free-riders, it will necessarily become established in the long run, through social learning, irrespective of the initial number of cooperators. We also demonstrate that punishing provides a "lighter touch" than rewarding, guaranteeing full cooperation at considerably lower cost.},

The results showed no analysis of product classification that causes the cooperatives fail to recognize how to control the quantity of the incoming and outgoing stocks appropriately. The results also showed no demand forecasting, resulting that certain products were ordered in higher quantity than stock demand on respective period, thereby affecting the evaluation of the inventory management performance, leading to a loss to certain kind of products, increased logistics cost, and deviation of data calculated for reserve management variables. In this study, the results also demonstrated that reserve management on the basis of order quantity can improve the effectiveness and reduce the ordering cost and reserve cost. Thus, forecasting and appropriate reserve model has reduced logistics cost in ordering in pursuit to the cooperative business substantially. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

	abstract = {Co-operatives have been likened to a 'network of contracts' or 'coalition'. This is particularly the case for 'producer owned' co-operatives that have small business operators such as farmers as their members. Although there has been some research into the strategic networking of co-operatives, there has been little attention given to the network behaviour and benefits to small firms as members of co-operatives, in particular to the benefits, risks and management issues associated with such networks. This research draws on case study data from Australian and French producer co-operatives to examine how small firms use co-operatives as a strategic network. It uses a conceptual framework for small firm alliances and networks originally developed by Street and Cameron (2007), and examines three research questions proposed in that study along with three interrelated theories (the resource based view, resource dependency and punctuated equilibrium). The study finds support for the conceptual framework and the theories as useful research tools. It also provides insights into the way small firms can use co-operatives to secure access to resources and mitigate environmental risk. However, the sustainability of these co-operatives is contingent effective network management, adaptability and the maintenance of member trust and loyalty. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cotton, both a source of livelihood for millions of poor rural households and a major source of export revenues, is a vital commodity for the economic and social development of Mali. Inefficiencies in the Malian cotton system at the ginnery and producers' cooperative levels (e.g., late payment to farmers and poorly functioning credit schemes) have recently led to an important decline in supply, threatening the sustainability of the sector. Using regional data from 1998/1999 to 2008/2009, this study aims to quantitatively assess the contribution of key determinants, such as cotton prices and timely payment, toward the downward trend in cotton area. A dynamic supply model, based on adaptive expectations and partial adjustment, is employed to estimate the effects of prices and institutional factors, such as credit recovery rates and date of payment to farmers, on the Malian cotton supply. Results show that supply responds significantly to cotton prices relative to cereal and fertilizer prices. Date of payment varies across agricultural cycles and late payment negatively influences land devoted to cotton. Low credit repayment rates create disincentives to grow cotton. Therefore, the revitalization of the Malian cotton sector depends upon getting both prices and institutions right. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a case study of two projects that integrated participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) methodology into both field practice and institutional development. The project evaluation data were collected from semi-structured interviews, observation and secondary sources. Findings: The cooperatives increased community income through collectively improving members' production and marketing capabilities. As well as economic benefits, the Shandan cooperatives show improvements in social collaboration that include enhanced inter- and intra-family relationships, community harmony and raised status for women. Research limitations/implications: The cooperatives have only operated since the new co-op law was enacted 1 July 2007. While the findings are preliminary, planned ongoing evaluation for the Shandan co-ops will review the sustainability of the economic and social gains made. Practical implications: The lessons learned from the participatory approach to improve rural cooperative development in Shandan County are relevant to researchers and practitioners, and can be applied by rural communities throughout China. Originality/value: Although the new style cooperatives have the potential to improve the rural economy, leading to poverty reduction and social development, there have been few case studies of the establishment and progress of these enterprises in China's poorer regions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Humans extensively help others altruistically, which plays an important role in maintaining cooperative societies. Although some nonhuman animals are also capable of helping others altruistically, humans are considered unique in our voluntary helping and our variety of helping behaviors. Many still believe that this is because only humans can understand others' goals due to our unique "theory of mind" abilities, especially shared intentionality. However, we know little of the cognitive mechanisms underlying helping in nonhuman animals, especially if and how they understand others' goals. The present study provides the empirical evidence for flexible targeted helping depending on conspecifics' needs in chimpanzees. The subjects of this study selected an appropriate tool from a random set of seven objects to transfer to a conspecific partner confronted with differing tooluse situations, indicating that they understood what their partner needed. This targeted helping, (i.e., selecting the appropriate tool to transfer), was observed only when the helpers could visually assess their partner's situation. If visual access was obstructed, the chimpanzees still tried to help their partner upon request, but failed to select and donate the appropriate tool needed by their partner. These results suggest that the limitation in chimpanzees' voluntary helping is not necessarily due to failure in understanding others' goals. Chimpanzees can understand conspecifics' goals and demonstrate cognitively advanced targeted helping as long as they are able to visually evaluate their conspecifics' predicament. However, they will seldom help others without direct request for help.},

	abstract = {The starting point for this paper is the finding that references to a system of self-managed firms as the future social order are quite exceptional in the published literature on Marxist thought. Despite ever more marked deviations of leftist political platforms from the centralised model of the URSS, it is clear that self-management has not taken the place of central planning in Marxist plans for the future. In contrast, the author will come up with evidence that an analysis of the self-managed firm system may offer clues for a critical discussion of major points of Marxian theory, including the labour theory of value, alienation, dialectics or the subject-object inversion in capitalism. Accordingly, in the individual sections of this paper each of these central aspects of Marxian theory will be separately addressed in the light of insights flowing from the economic theory of producer cooperatives. © The Author 2012.

	abstract = {At the heart of one of the most densely populated mega-cities of India lies an eco-friendly and sustainable developmental business model. The city in question is Kolkata and the profitable but environmentally friendly venture that will be highlighted in this paper is that of wastewater-fed aquaculture practiced by a cooperative run by the local fishermen, namely Mudialy Fisherman's Cooperative Society (MFCS). Initially the marshy wetlands of Mudialy used to be flooded with polluted waste water from the city and the local industrial complex. Ultimately, the polluted water was released to the sacred River Ganges. This cooperative society has radically transformed these wetlands into an urban fishery and a water-front recreational ecosystem. The present paper focuses on the incredible task completed by the MFCS and also reports the results of water-quality analyses to ascertain that conditions in the water bodies of MFCS are ideal for a profitable aquaculture practice. All the water quality parameters studied (physicochemical water parameters, concentration of different heavy metals, and zooplankton community structure) were well within the normal limits from the point of view of pisciculture. This proves the efficiency of the wastewater purification system adopted by the cooperative society. The major advantage of wastewater-fed aquaculture over conventional wastewater treatment is the large diversity of marketable products and therefore broad possibilities of income generation. Thanks to the poor fishermen of MFCS, the water drained from these wetlands into the River Ganges is no longer polluted. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The purpose of this research is to study the needs and opportunities for agricultural credit in the Adana region (675,000 ha including 223,000 irrigated). In the region farms have a very intensive production, with large input requirements and investments. In addition, prices and product yields fluctuate with weather conditions, market conditions, as well as farmers' choices to certain specialized production, which causes a large fluctuation in farm income. This offset can cause additional problems. On the other hand, traditional or modern family expenses, increase with urbanization. This phenomenon, coupled with a general increase in agricultural production costs, are causing a severe shortage of working capital to the farmer, who then sees the increase on its credit requirements. Normally, agricultural credit is mainly provided by the State agencies (Agricultural Bank, Agricultural Cooperatives). Indeed, this system is cheaper for farmers because the interest rates charged are well below the inflation rate but it requires guarantees, formality restrict the volume of loans actually granted, especially for small farmers. Thus, the latter to torment a parallel range of credit (loan shark, firms, non-agricultural banks, etc.) or the interest rate is generally very high and the formalities for obtaining less painful.},

	abstract = {Irrespective of the success of the Indonesian Government to achieve self-sufficiency of rice in 1985, and the rice price stabilization, paddy growers still suffer from a very low price for their produce. Koperasi Unit Desa (KUDs) -in Indonesian, or Village Unit Cooperative (VUC) have been entrusted with the marketing of rice paddies although their performance has always been less than satisfactory. One problem experienced by the KUDs is not having sufficient cash to purchase and process paddies into rice. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a simulation model to represent cash flows during one paddy plantation season for a KUD (VUC). The simulation model is a decision support tool that enables a KUD's (VUC) management to determine the maximum quantity of paddies to be purchased; the minimum borrowing and additional borrowing; and the earnings before taxes. An investigator-administrated questionnaire was used to collect historical data of the twenty randomly selected KUDs (VUC) on Lombok Island to validate the sub-models of the simulation model. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit (two-sample), linear regression, correlation and t- tests were used to validate the simulation model. The validation results have shown that the sub-models of the simulation model are valid, and these may contribute to the valid results of the simulation model. This study has found that the limitations of the paddy storage building, drying floor, and milling machine owned by the KUDs (VUC) may restrict the KUDs (VUC) from buying the entire paddies harvested. Therefore, further research is needed to find out the minimum capacities of those facilities enabling the KUDs (VUC) to work efficiently.},

Just as climatic profiles will influence the future viability of crops, institutions, i.e., governance agreements, rural household and community norms, local associations, markets, and agricultural ministries, to name but a few, create the conditions that foster sustainable food systems. Because discussions of agricultural sustainability often overlook the full range of social dimensions, we propose a dual focus on a broad set of criteria, i.e., human health, labor, democratic participation, resiliency, biological and cultural diversity, equity, and ethics, to assess social outcomes, and on institutions that could support diversified farming systems (DFS). A comparative analysis of case studies from California's Central Valley, Mesoamerican coffee agroforestry systems, and European Union agricultural parks finds that DFS practices are unevenly adopted within and among these systems and interdependent with institutional environments that specifically promote diversified farming practices. Influential institutions in these cases include state policies, farmers' cooperatives/associations, and organized civic efforts to influence agroenvironmental policy, share knowledge, and shape markets for more 'sustainable' products. The Californian and Mesoamerican cases considers organic and fair trade certifications, finding that although they promote several DFS practices and generate social benefits, they are inadequate as a single strategy to promote agricultural sustainability. The complex governance and multifunctional management of Europe's peri-urban agricultural parks show unexpected potential for promoting DFS. Unless DFS are anchored in supportive institutions and evaluated against an inclusive set of social and environmental criteria, short-term investments to advance diversified agriculture could miss a valuable opportunity to connect ecological benefits with social benefits in the medium and long terms. © 2012 by the author(s).},

Explanations have been put forward, comprising a variety of economic and sociological theories. The present study suggests that the social capital paradigm may add explanatory power when analyzing this development. It is claimed that the problems are due to the members having increasingly little trust in the cooperatives and in each other. The cooperatives' decision makers have no instruments for estimating how much social capital is lost when they pursue strategies of vertical and horizontal integration. Therefore, they do not consider this loss in their calculations. Thus, the problems caused by the cooperatives' vaguely defined property rights are becoming increasingly serious.

Some of the institutions even connect environmental and sustainability issues with their general business strategies. Compared with other countries, Canadian banks are best in class, as all six Canadian commercial banks, comprising over 90 percent of Canadian assets, systematically examine environmental risks for credits, loans and mortgages. We conclude that Canadian banks are proactive regarding environmental examinations of loans and that there is a need for a more accountancy related reporting on environmental risk management in financial institutions.

In addition to the so-called property rights problems (e.g., free-rider, horizon, and portfolio problems), the analysis of agricultural cooperatives has focused on issues of market power, agency, product quality, and increasingly producer and consumer heterogeneity. These last three elements are important features of the industrialization of the agrifood system. This article highlights the key concepts required for examination of cooperatives now and in the future and incorporates these concepts into a framework that can be used to examine the myriad situations and problem settings in which agricultural cooperatives are likely to be found. A key finding of the paper is that the procompetitive and distributional impacts of cooperatives depend critically on the sensitivity of price in the downstream retail market, the nature of the cooperative's governance structure, and the open or closed nature of cooperative membership.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the research is to identify the observable operational and supply chain barriers and constraints that occur in local food supply chains, especially with smaller producers, as they seek to increase market penetration across a wider geographic area. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopts a multiple case study approach using mixed methods of data collection where case study companies are interviewed and complete a questionnaire. This process allows us to create a supply chain map and create a narrative which records the burdens and impacts occurring in local food supply chains and smaller producers looking beyond local markets. This evidence is then set against the theory of constraints (TOC) to provide a theoretical underpinning and to examine consistency of the findings. Findings: Seven broad categories of constraint type are observed: constraints due to the nature of the market; due to scale and the nature of products; constraints related to employment and skills; institutional constraints; constraints in supply chain relationships; certification, policy and regulatory constraints; and constraints around personal beliefs and anthropomorphism. Each is described as to its origin, its limitation to business and where possible, how it might be remedied. The constraints point to some counter-intuitive results as far as common perceptions of local food are concerned but suggestions for improvement are made through collaborative producer efforts, alternative institutional intervention, supply chain re-engineering and logistics innovation. Practical implications: Practical suggestions are made to improve the inclusiveness of distribution networks, to better utilise regional food groups (RFGs), to develop opportunities to set up autonomous supply chain centres, or to broaden the function of farmer co-operatives. The paper also provides an alternative model of the TOC specifically adapted for local food producers, the focus of which plays to their strengths and focuses on building competencies across, up and down the supply chain. Originality/value: The adaptation of the TOC provides an advancement of knowledge in the area of food supply chain analysis and is done in a way that is more practical in use. The paper also provides the opportunity to take a similar approach to examining other niche supply opportunities in the sector, which may be dependent on other geographically defined barriers, such as seasonal or ethnic products. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This article argues that the dividend, though important, was only one aspect of financial assistance co-operative retail societies offered their members. By focusing on the period of the 1920s-40s, it explores how collective strength and mutual aid provided by societies extended to financial support during periods of economic crisis and industrial action. Credit in times of need was especially important for members of societies affected by trade depression, industrial crisis and unemployment during the interwar years. The article also argues that membership could give access to much wider support than is typically associated with the retail aspect of co-operative societies. For example, societies assisted individual members, or the families of members, during periods of illness and death. The article highlights how, as trading organisations, the spirit of mutual help within co-operative retail societies incorporated an element of collective expenditure. In addition to providing support for hospitals located in the communities in which they traded, societies also offered financial aid to nationally recognised charities. In this way financial assistance and support provided through the co-operative business model was not solely focused on extending the purchasing power of individual consumers. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This paper provides contextual data and information for the development of PAMs specifically for the buffer zones of protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon, sites where REDD+ has the potential to generate considerable social and ecological co-benefits. The study sites are the buffer zones of two national parks, Yanachaga-Chemillen (YChNP) in central Peru and Manu (MNP) in the south-east. Data were collected through smallholder household surveys (n = 200), covering livelihood strategies, land use practices and preference rankings of five REDD+ criteria. The findings suggest that PAMs in buffer zones could realistically achieve an additional ~10 % conservation of remaining forest and between 25 and 70 % additional reforestation of non-forest areas on private lands. The paper argues that in areas where agricultural co-operatives exist, such as MNP, these should be engaged in national REDD+ PAMs and supported by an international NGO; in areas where smallholders operate individually, such as YChNP, international NGOs may be best placed to gain local trust and thereby raise participation rates. The environmental effectiveness of REDD+ conservation PAMs could be greater in areas of intense agricultural production, yet financial and technical support for reforestation may offer the most effective avenue for carbon mitigation in these areas. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Thus, the study aims to identify some strategic enabling cooperatives to increase its revenue and result. Through simulations, the study also shows the effects on income if the suggested strategies are implemented and projections prove accurate. The relevance of this study is justified by the growing importance of costs in decision-making organizations, as well as the difficulty that shops belonging to cooperatives face to increase its turnover due to the restriction of the market. The methodology used in this project is the case study, considering the processes related to a cooperative, showing variable costs, contribution margin and market potential. The results of the study, it appears that the cooperative can increase by 64% its sales to farmers cooperatives that supply milk, if kept the relationship shown between the cooperative and ten associates evaluated.

To this end, it considers two alternative market structures. Namely, the pure ones, where the buyers of a primary commodity are private firms, and mixed ones, where a private firm competes against a producer's cooperative. According to the results, the pure-strategy location equilibrium in both cases involves a distance between the two players larger or equal to 1/4. Nevertheless, the equilibriums are qualitatively different. In the pure duopsony, a large distance is required to prevent a price war while in the mixed duopsony, the private firm tries to stay away from the co-op in order to ensure a strictly positive profit.},

	abstract = {In 2005, shortly after the Venezuelan government declared 'twenty-first-century socialism' as its development goal, Chávez launched 'social production companies' to change the way communities produced and exchanged goods. Investigation of the relationship between these companies, agrarian cooperatives, and the oil economy calls into question assessments by both the right and the left, the former portraying Venezuelan development initiatives as populist profligacy and the latter seeing them as a socialist alternative to neoliberal hegemony. An analytical focus upon ground rent and the way it is distributed through the social production companies that draws upon insights from the Marxian critique of political economy provides an original window onto the contradictions and limits of the Chávez government's development policies. Three case studies suggest that social production companies and their links with small agrarian cooperatives are reproducing a limited and ground-rent-dependent form of capital accumulation that, coupled with the ideology of popular power, is being presented as a step toward twentyfirst- century socialism. En 2005, poco después de que el gobierno venezolano declarara el 'socialismo del siglo veintiuno' como su objetivo de desarrollo, Chávez lanzó las 'empresas de producción social' para cambiar la forma en que las comunidades producían e intercambiaban bienes. Una investigación de la relación entre estas empresas, las cooperativas agrarias, y la economía petrolera pone en tela de juicio las evaluaciones tanto de la derecha como la izquierda, la primera representando las iniciativas del desarrollo venezolano como derroche populista y la segunda viéndolas como la alternativa socialista a la hegemonía neoliberal. Un enfoque analítico sobre la renta de la tierra y su distribución por medio de las empresas de producción social que se fundamenta en la critica marxiana de la economía política ofrece una ventana original hacia las contradicciones y límites de la política de desarrollo chavista. Tres estudios de caso sugieren que las empresas de producción social y sus vínculos con pequeñas cooperativas agrícolas están reproduciendo una forma de acumulación de capital limitada y dependiente de la renta de la tierra, la cual, junta con la ideología de poder popular, se está presentando como un paso hacia el socialismo del siglo veintiuno. © 2013 Latin American Perspectives.},

The comparative analysis shows the relevance of the social and cultural contexts in shaping the mechanisms of governance, as well contributing to the policy debate in the European Union regarding new food quality schemes.},

The article also assesses the participation of agribusiness cooperatives in the production of items included in the model and the possible influences this type of organization could exert on changes addressed to economical efficiency. Through questionnaires and interviews with cooperative managers, it was possible to assess the cooperative willingness to motivate changes on their production and their member portfolios. It was also possible to verify that the main reasons influencing decisions on production preference changes are related to economical and rational aspects, such as cooperative strategic focus and member resistance. Reasons related to political or social aspects are inherent to the cooperative organizational characteristics, however, in the Paraná's context these reasons do not exert significant influence on diversification decisions considered as market risk management tools.},

The core of this strategy is the orientation on the region, local and regional food and food products and the co-operation with local small and medium suppliers. Another part of this strategy is also the permanent control of quality of these products and creation of the special private label - Quality food from our region. The consumer co-operative co-operates also with the regional grouping under another label - Tastes great. Southbohemian. The assessment is done by means of the analysis of a questionnaire survey that was done among consumers in the South Bohemia in 2011. The strongest factor differentiating customers of the retail chain TERNO from other consumer is the orientation on regional or local products, which explains about 41% of variability. Other differentiating factors are environment-friendly production and selling and quality of food. All these three factors explain in total 66.5% of variability of the data set.},

Options that are analyzed include growth and restructuring, dividend allocation, member entry and exit, and member embedded value options. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical estimates of the options’ financial value, as well as sensitivity analyses, are presented for a stylized example using historical data and Monte Carlo option-pricing methods. Attention is paid to the effect of member age, discount rate and business operation size. Findings – Results suggest that the board’s growth options can be substantial, while member options generally have small but nontrivial value. Implications for the stability of membership are drawn. Practical implications – The financial or economic value of strategic options in agricultural cooperatives can be significant, and decision makers may benefit from accounting for their presence. Originality/value – Cooperatives play an important role in agribusiness but have undergone significant changes in the past two decades in terms of organizational and financial structure. This paper contributes to an understanding of the value of control and residual rights associated with the Board and members of cooperatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Information and communication technology usage has brought a lot of transformation into the Nigerian economy. The most recent is the introduction of mobile and e-banking into the banking industry and this has extended accessibility of banking facility to many of the previously unbanked Nigerians. This study examined the extent to which mobile phones have aided financial services among farming households in rural southwest Nigeria. Data for this study were collected from a random sample of 360 farming households in Ekiti and Osun States. Descriptive analysis of data on respondents' socioeconomic characteristics showed that the farmers are aging (average age is 55 years) with only about one-third (34.7 per cent) having tertiary education. Respondents' distribution by services conducted on their mobile phones indicated transfer of recharge cards which are later converted into cash as the most patronized. Important correlates of mobile phones usage as mobile banks include age, years of formal education, membership of cooperative societies, household size and access to power (electricity). © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

In developed economies, such as the USA and Canada, these organizations, aligned with the theoretical proposition, adopt governance models that promote the separation of ownership and decision rights. However, in Brazil, despite the lack ofquantitative studies that measure governance separation, anecdotal evidence suggests that ownership and decisions rights are concentrated in Brazilian cooperatives. By means of a survey with 77 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives, this paper measures the degree of de jure and de facto separation of ownership and decision control, providing new evidences on the governance models observed in different countries. Different models coexist in Brazil, i.e., although the majority of agricultural cooperatives concentrate ownership and decision rights, a significant proportion organize themselves consistently with the theoretical proposition, adopting the American models of agricultural cooperatives. Further research is required in order to address the determinants of the variety of governance models in Brazil.},

The result arises because there is a trade-off between raising profits through increased group size and providing incentives for borrowers with less social ties.

	abstract = {The relative efficiency of producer co-operatives is investigated through an examination of the financial performance of a group of cotton spinning firms that emerged from the spread of co-operative ideals after the mid-nineteenth century. Reflecting such influences these firms adopted two particularly important aspects of democratic governance: use of low denomination partly paid shares to encourage wide share ownership among local working class operatives, and the use of a one shareholder one vote rule at company meetings. Prior literature, much of which predicts the failure of producer co-operatives due to incentive problems, has not specifically examined these aspects of democratic control. Moreover because the case study utilises samples of stock market quoted companies, there is an opportunity to quantify the financial performance effects of these governance mechanisms. The case study therefore offers a unique insight and important contribution to the wider literature. The results show that both aspects of democratic governance contributed to the economic success of the companies that adopted them, enabling them to satisfy the high demand for cash dividends that characterised investor requirements. However, the cyclical nature of the cotton industry and the stock market booms and slumps that resulted led to redistributions of wealth through time that in the long run undermined the co-operative project. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Balh Valley in the northwestern Himalayas in India is well known for cultivation of high-value cash crops and vegetables. The Indo-German Agricultural Project executed four decades ago in the valley has been the driving force for agrarian development in the valley, but crops are still grown under nutrient-starved conditions, giving low productivity compared to national averages. To demonstrate and disseminate the integrated nutrient management (INM) technology in the irrigated ecosystem of Balh Valley, efforts were funded by the Indian Farmers' Fertilizers Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) to develop sustainable crop production systems under cash crops and vegetables following an appropriate technology transfer model by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Sundernagar, India. For effective technology transfer, field demonstrations, method demonstrations, farmers' training camps, field days, and numerous field conventions were organized in addition to extending soil testing, literature supply, promotional seed and fertilizer input supply, and training of agro-cooperative society personnel who deal with seed and fertilizer input supply in the region. The greater extension gaps in tomato-blackgram and potato-Kharif onion crop sequences indicated need for effective technology transfer tools for high adoption of technology in these production systems in the valley. Potato-Kharif onion cropping system using INM technology resulted in greater system productivity in terms of blackgram equivalent yield (76.7q ha-1) and gross (3,06,920 ha-1) and net returns (2,22,295 ha-1), followed by tomato-blackgram and green pea-okra production systems, respectively, using an appropriate technology transfer model. The study also revealed improvement in available nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P)-potassium (K) and organic carbon (C) pool of the soils besides crop productivity and profitability in field trials under INM practices over farmers' practiced plots. Knowledge before the study about soil testing, dose and time of application of organics, chemical fertilizers, and their integrated use ranged from 9 to 41%, whereas knowledge increases after the study ranged between 55 to 88%. The INM technology adoption rate after 1 year of project completion ranged between 66 to 70%, whereas soil testing was done by only 35% of farmers. Thus, INM technology adoption rate was greater following the appropriate technology transfer model based on critical analyses of fertilizer use, existing production systems, and appropriate interventions for technology transfer. This comprehensive study under the IFFCO-KVK Collaborative Project attempts to highlight that an effective technology transfer model can play a key role in adoption of INM technology for sustainable production systems in the developing world, especially for resource- and knowledge-poor farmers of collateral socioagroeconomic environments of developing nations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

We find long-tenured CEOs experience less board monitoring. This result is primarily due to a difference in procedural mechanisms, rather than board composition. However, it is unclear whether monitoring leniency is an indication of the CEO's ability to negotiate less monitoring. It remains a possibility that CEOs with shorter tenures also influence the board; but their recommendations may be heavily influenced by non-compulsory conformance with stricter corporate governance regulations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

By eliminating an outside residual claimant with control over the firm, these alternatives to investor ownership reduce the incentive of the firm to offer such terms. However, customers who are unaware of their behavioral biases may fail to recognize this advantage of non-investor-owned firms. We present evidence from the consumer financial services market that supports our theory. Comparing contract terms, we find that mutually owned firms offer lower penalties, such as default interest rates, and higher up-front prices, such as introductory interest rates, than do investor-owned firms. However, consumers most vulnerable to these penalties are no more likely to use mutually owned firms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Local (independent) traders still constitute a major market for coffee producers. Yet, cooperatives also accept the produce from non-members and pay them the same price. Our objective in this paper is to analyse the importance of this phenomenon of double side-selling. We collected data from a sample of 170 coffee farmers. We use a probit model to analyse characteristics linked to cooperative membership and to study double side-selling. We describe the trade relationships between farmers and the cooperative on the one hand, and between farmers and traders on the other by the attributes of transaction costs involved in the trade of coffee. Membership characteristics include easy access to labour, land tenure, risk aversion, and mutual trust between farmers and cooperatives' management. Preference to sell to traders can be explained by the trust farmers seem to have in them after the repeated transactions in credit and basic consumption items and by long-term relationships in the community. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

From the 1970s the town's inhabitants had enjoyed a secure livelihood and relative prosperity. The collapse of the socialist economy resulted in mass unemployment. The privatisation and the transformation of the structure of ownership were experienced in a positive way by only a few, the majority of the town's inhabitants have been living in existential crisis for two decades now. A high percentage, close to 50% of those of active age, live on social benefits. The fewer than half a dozen medium-sized enterprises that strengthened after the turn of the millennium, and agriculture - which is characterised by a strong concentration of land-holding - are able to employ only a small proportion of the population. The majority of the town's inhabitants are characterised by "invisible impoverishment" and struggle against loss of status. The lack of prospects leads to the out-migration of young people with qualifications. It is projected that fifteen to twenty years from now the town's population will be made up of the inactive with low qualifications and the elderly. The economy, society, demography and health care all show an unfavourable picture. Anomie has become a permanent state. Comparative analysis of the economic and social indicators shows that Túrkeve can be described as an "average" settlement in Hungary today.},

In Ibaragi Prefecture north of Tokyo, the agricultural cooperatives that provide inputs to farmers and market their vegetables and other produce helped their farmer-members introduce foreign trainees, who allowed farmers to expand their production and increased cooperative sales. Trainees must be paid the Japanese mini-mum wage for most of the 36 months they are in Japan with the additional costs for train-related system, but they are still cheaper than full-time Japanese farm workers.

As employees are key stakeholders, they play a vital part in achieving organizational goals. This study, a work in progress, highlights an in-depth, qualitative analysis of two organizations-one in Canada and one in Australia-committed to funding community projects as part of their corporate social responsibility development and commitment. The importance of a qualitative study that focuses on subjective components of social capital is that it develops understanding of employees' attitudes, feelings, and viewpoints. It also begins to investigate why employees might/might not be committed, to organizations' social capital initiatives. Using an interpretative analysis lens, an understanding of the moral, relational, and communication dynamics is explored. Questions surrounding concepts such as the moral fiber of social capital are highlighted and critiqued in the context of community engagement and what organizations' social capital investments mean as part of their responsibility to society. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities. To conclude, we discuss the advantages and challenges of politicizing cooperatives and offer reflections on how these challenges might be overcome.},

	abstract = {To advance the effectiveness of the current Hanwoo improvement system, we developed a general simulation that compared a series of breeding schemes under realistic user circumstances. We call this system the Integrated General Model (IGM) and it allows users to control the breeding schemes and selection methods by manipulating the input parameters. The Current Hanwoo Performance and Progeny Test (CHPPT) scheme was simulated with a Modified Hanwoo Performance and Progeny Test (MHPPT) scheme using a Hanwoo Breeding Farm cow population of the Livestock Improvement Main Center (LOMC) of the National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation (NACF). To compare the two schemes, a new method, the Simple Hanwoo Performance Test (SHPT), which uses ultrasound technology for measuring the carcass traits of live animals, was developed. These three models, including the CHPPT, incorporated three types of selection criteria: phenotype (PH), true breeding value (TBV), and estimated breeding value (EBV). The simulation was scheduled to mimic an actual Hanwoo breeding program; thus, the simulation was run to include the years 1983-2020 for each breeding method and was replicated 10 times. The parameters for simulation were derived from the literature. Approximately 642,000 animals were simulated per replication for the CHPPT scheme; 129,000 animals were simulated for the MHPPT scheme and 112,000 animals for the SHPT scheme. Throughout the 38-year simulation, all estimated parameters of each simulated population, regardless of population size, showed results similar to the input parameters. The deviations between input and output values for the parameters in the large populations were statistically acceptable. In this study, we integrated three simulated models, including the CHPPT, in an attempt to achieve the greatest genetic gains within major economic traits including body weight at 12 months of age (BW12), body weight at 24 months of age (BW24), average daily gain from 6 to 12 months (ADG), carcass weight (CWT), carcass longissimus muscle area (CLMA), carcass marbling score (CMS), ultrasound scanned longissimus muscle area (ULMA), and ultrasound scanned marbling score (UMS).},

Individual incentives are not aligned with group gains in cooperatives because individual members bear the costs of offering higher qualities, whereas the benefits from these higher qualities are shared among all members. We present a blind mechanism whose quality-enhancing properties are analyzed in a theoretical model. This mechanism, which does not require individual monitoring, consists of individually punishing co-op members by using aggregate co-op performance in such way that the better the co-op quality, the lower the exclusion probability. In a computerized environment, using experimental methods, we specifically test the effectiveness of our mechanism in alleviating the incentive problem. Experimental results show that our blind punishment mechanism achieves significant efficiency gains. © The Author(s) 2010.

Using the theory of collective action as an analytical framework the paper examined findings from in-depth interviews with 20 members of two co-operative initiatives in Wales and two participatory workshops. Consideration of the theory helped in understanding how individuals come together to provide public goods, and the conditions that make this activity a success. Factors of importance for organising and delivering collective agrienvironment schemes were: locally adaptable engagement strategies; working with group members previously known to each other; institutional arrangements that limited group size and which allowed groups to develop their own solutions and implementation rules; and external support offering the services of a local facilitator and funding for both planning and management stages. A clear finding from the research was the extent to which both business and social confidence can grow within such groups which opens up further development opportunities. The paper identifies key factors that could be used to encourage and enhance the success of co-operative groups in delivering landscape-scale agri-environment schemes. The research findings identify appropriate mechanisms for the design and delivery of collective agri-environment schemes and environment management in the UK, which can also be applied to other parts of Europe. © 2011 Wageningen University.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to consider the historical basis of development of corporate social responsibility and the impact of this on co-operative enterprises and member-owned businesses. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint identified by years of experience dealing with co-operative organisations. Findings: The paper finds that the basis of development of corporate social responsibility from the perspective of commercial corporations does not promote an adequate accounting framework for co-operative enterprises and member-owned businesses. Research limitations/implications: Practitioners in different areas of business are trying to make sense of sustainability accounting and reporting in a commercial setting. This piece by one of these, draws on a topical initiative around co-operative enterprises to raise questions around what is meant by performance in the context of member-owned enterprises and whether the field of corporate social responsibility has overlooked the relevance of ownership in terms of organisational incentives for action. Practical implications: The author proposes a series of definitions for co-operative performance, which are designed to underpin metrics that relate to "member value". This is offered in contrast to "shareholder value" for companies that, unlike co-operatives, are owned by external shareholders. Social implications: The field of corporate social responsibility is a major user and innovator of the tools and techniques for sustainability accounting and reporting. But it tends to be silent on ownership. However, if different models of ownership create different incentives for action on sustainable development, then rather than just accounting for "how" an enterprise operates, however it is owned and led, there may be value in tools to test "whether" an institution is fit for purpose in its fundamental design. Originality/value: The paper develops a new perspective and future research opportunities in identifying performance measures for co-operative enterprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that the evolution of cooperative behaviour is favoured by low levels of promiscuity leading to high within-group relatedness 1-5. However, in vertebrates, cooperation often occurs between non-relatives and promiscuity rates are among the highest recorded. Here we resolve this apparent inconsistency with a phylogenetic analysis of 267 bird species, demonstrating that cooperative breeding is associated with low promiscuity; that in cooperative species, helping is more common when promiscuity is low; and that intermediate levels of promiscuity favour kin discrimination. Overall, these results suggest that promiscuity is a unifying feature across taxa in explaining transitions to and from cooperative societies. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Farming cooperative credit sections are financial instruments set up within a cooperative and at its service. They are key funding tools in rural areas and have been developed all over Spain although more intensely in some areas than others. The aim of this paper is to carry out a strategic diagnosis of the Spanish credit section using a SWOT Analysis to discover its set of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, as well as a proposal for strategic actions to be followed. In order to do so an empirical study using personalized surveys and interviews has been undertaken among the managers or persons in charge of the credit sections over the first half of 2008. The study demonstrates that they are efficient entities for their clients (cooperative members). Their main strengths are focussed on their clients, although they show significant weaknesses in organizational, business and technological capacities, which require an effort to provide them with more professional management. Legal constraints are the main threat at present, although uncertainty in the agricultural sector affects their survival. © 2011 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2011 CIRIEC.},

The research is a case study, in which the average values were used, paid and received for the month of January 2009. The data collection instruments used were a literature review, desk review of company documents, on-site observation and interviews with company managers. The results show that all stages of the value chain realize profits from the producer to the distributor, and the smaller portion was for the producer and the largest in the industry. It is concluded that the manufacturing industry contributed the largest share of final consumer price. It cost elements are the most representative raw material and transport (production costs), as well as in the case of long life UHT milk, the packaging, which accounts for 19% of the amount paid by the consumer. Moreover, it is suggested that the role of key players - producers' cooperatives, manufacturers and distributors - and the impact of their logistics costs in the final price targets of future studies.},

While the smallest rural savings banks continue their policy of support for the agrarian cooperatives and their partners, the larger ones are getting out of agrarian cooperativism.},

The gain is net of the costs of cooperative participation but not of other costs incurred to become certified and suggests that price premiums alone have a limited potential to increase household returns from growing coffee.

Also, they do not have any specific risk business control, or risk management is not yet worked out with emphasis by agricultural cooperatives.

Cooperatives and commission agents have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question the advantages and disadvantages that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of small-scale farmers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the management and economic success of beef production by three types of farm in northwestern Vietnam. The potential of household farms to supply beef for the market and their competition with large farms were examined. The fieldwork was done in 2007 on 73 farms consisting of 58 small mixed farms (small farms), 10 medium mixed farms (medium farms) and 5 specialised large-scale beef farms (large farms) in Son La province. The three types of farm differed in ethnicity (Thai, H'mong, and Kinh), remoteness (lowland, highland), production objectives (subsistence, market output), degree of specialization (mixed farm, specialised beef farm) and integration of production (single farmers, cooperative). Data on biological productivity, inputs and outputs, and the social contribution of cattle production were collected by household and key person interviews, participatory rural appraisal tools and cattle body measurements. Economic values were derived by assessment of market or replacement costs. Quantitative data analysis was done with linear models (PROC GLM) in the SAS software (version 9.1). Lowland small farms had higher costs for cattle production than the highland farms (0.8 Mill. VND head-1 year-1 compared with 0.02 Mill. VND head-1 year-1, respectively). The large farms had high production costs, with an average of 2.5-3.6 Mill. VND head-1 year-1. Cattle brought high benefits of non-cash values to the household farms. The total revenue from cattle was in the range 4.5-11.5 Mill. VND head-1 year-1, which depended on the use of non-market functions of cattle on the household farm. The value of net benefit/kg live weight (LW) of lowland small farms with an average of 39,000 VND/kg LW was significantly higher than that of the medium and small farms in the highlands (26,000 VND/kg LW). However, the small farms kept fewer cattle than the medium farms (average of 2-4 cattle/farm compared with 9 cattle/farm, respectively) because of forage and labour shortages and have no option to further develop cattle production. Keeping larger numbers of cattle based on available natural pasture brought high benefit from stock value as farm liquidity to only the medium farms. This was the most promising type of farm for future development of beef production, given its actual success and the availability of underutilised resources. Large-scale farms suffered high economic losses of 0.3-1.4 Mill. VND cattle-1 year-1, due to the lack of professional management, high feed costs and low animal performance, and showed no potential for developing cattle production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Territorial development involves the organized participation of social actors in decisions regarding the use of the public - and, largely, private - resources of a region. Despite the obvious democratic virtues of the participatory processes, there has been a recent increase in the critical literature, questioning their results. This paper intends to reveal the tension experienced by the contemporary social movements: the conflict between representativeness and innovation. Representa tive movements tend to consolidate and strengthen interests, and their institutionalization pushes them towards routine attitudes that often block their innovative potential. One way out of the impasses of the social movements is in the terms of management of the social participation focused explicitly on learning and innovation. Organizations coming from social movements are an essential part of the participatory processes. This article, based on the example of the Brazilian policy of strengthening family agriculture, examines two of those organizations whose origin is in the social movements: the Federação dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura Familiar - FETRAF (Federation of Workers in Family Farming), which is a trade union; and the CRESOL System of cooperatives for credit outreach. Both organizations stimulate participatory processes and are associated with government policies. In the case of the trade union, however, social participation does not result in innovation, and the ties with the government tend to restrict the movement to relations already known. As regards the credit cooperative, social participation and ties with the government are the result of incentives that encourage the strengthening of what the new economic sociology calls weak ties, and thus open the way to expand the very foundations of the processes of local development.},

This approach is applied to a database of 163 farms located in the Campos County, a region belonging to the dry lands of the Spanish Northern Plateau, using 12 individual indicators of sustainability. Our findings show that both economic and environmental composite sustainability indicators are positively correlated, but that this is not the case for the social indicator. We also check the influence of a set of variables on farm sustainability using bootstrapping statistical techniques, and showing that increasing farm size, membership in agricultural cooperatives and farmers' medium and upper agricultural-specific technical education, all exert a significant positive influence on sustainability. These results provide clues for policy makers that intend to design sustainability-increasing structural agricultural policies. © 2011 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

There are 26224 Agriculture Co-operative Societies in the state among them many co-operatives are engaged with horticulture sector in Gujarat state. Amalsad Co-operative works in a highly competitive market. There are more than 15 private traders in the Amalsad market. But the co-operative accounts for 60% of the total market arrivals of fruits. With a paid up capital of Rs. 9.16 lakh and reserve funds of the order of Rs. 5.53 crore, the Amalsad Co-operative shows a robust financial performance. The cooperative made a profit of Rs. 46.89 lakh in 2006-07. Besides, the co-operative owns a petrol pump and a cloth store at Amalsad, though there is also a departmental store in the compound of the co-operative. The farmer members are given advance credit and many other input and consumption loans and facilities for the crop. Co-operatives were the main channel used to sell chickoo than regulated market. Highest price was received by farmer members of co-operative society during the corresponding year as compared by APMC and pre-harvest contractor. The main reason for the selection of cooperatives as marketing channel was higher price payment, the quality based and timely payment. Amalsad Co-operative Society had got two awards for the year 2006-07 i. e. National Productivity Award, 2006 and NCDC Award, 2006. Amalsad Co-operative is able to provide a sustainable solution to the marketing problems in horticulture as it is professionally organized and managed under the able supervision and direction of share holders.many ways, Amalsad Co-operatives come close to the New Generation Co-operatives. Due to their better marketing abilities, they have been able to gain member loyalty as well as overcome capital constraint which so often is a major problem for co-operative organizations. The role of Amalsad Co-operative is not only to develop the society but also increase the economic condition of the farmers.},

Data were obtained from 240 respondents including 120 mandarin fish farmers and 120 clown fish farmers, which were randomly selected from villages in the study area by means of structured and semi-structured questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and stochastic frontier function that incorporated inefficiency effects that were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE). The result showed that the sum of elasticity for mandarin fish and clown fish were found to be 1.36 and 1.25, respectively implies that both production systems were operated in inefficient stage (technically inefficient). The result also showed that fish farmers' educational level, accessto credit, farm size and feed positively influenced their levels of efficiency in mandarin fish and clown fish production systems in Cross River State. Extension agents should guide fish farmers on levels of inputs combination that would ensure efficient production of fish. Regular awareness campaign about new technologies in fish production should be embarked on by extension agents; this will enable fish farmers adopt new technologies in fish production. Extension agents should train fish farmers on improved production technique while banks should give loans to fish farmers and strictly monitor all her loan beneficiaries to ensure loan repayment. The study also recommends efficient policy formulation and implementation that will encourage fish farmers and unemployed youth in Cross River State to join fish producers cooperative(s) to enable them obtain loans at low interest rate from banks for increase in their capital base for higher output.},

All credit unions are governed by a volunteer board and many are reliant on volunteers for all their labour requirements. However, recruiting volunteers is a problem. The literature on recruitment issues in volunteering in general, suggests that the not-for-profit sector looks to the private sector for guidance on recruitment policies and approaches. One such approach which is considered in this paper is ‘market segmentation’ wherein the potential volunteer body is profiled to determine if an individual is likely to volunteer and if they are, to identify the type of role they are most likely to be attracted to. Prior literature on volunteering in non-profit organisations suggests that certain types of individual (dominant individuals) are more likely to volunteer. This paper investigates whether this dominant status profile is evident amongst volunteers in credit unions in Northern Ireland (NI). The study finds that people with dominant characteristics are more likely to be attracted to volunteering to the board of directors and individuals who have less dominant traits overall should be offered more social/participative type roles. This information can be used by credit union governing boards for volunteer recruitment, retention and management purposes. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the critique that farm leaders and Wheat Pool officials levelled against the open market, and the way they posited “orderly marketing” as a solution to their perceived problems. Using contemporary data on wheat prices and movements, it analyzes the content of orderly marketing, and the results of its implementation by the Pools. Findings – The paper finds that “orderly marketing” was primarily a campaign slogan, that the problems it was alleged to address did not exist, and that its implementation by the Wheat Pools did not yield the results that the farm leaders had promised. The paper acknowledges however, the significant accomplishments of these organizations, and postulates that the concept of orderly marketing resonates with aspects of Canadian culture and helps to explain why grain marketing in the USA and Canada evolved so differently. Originality/value – The agricultural cooperative movement in Western Canada has been the subject of a great deal of historical research, most of it positive.

	abstract = {Purpose: In this paper, the key drivers and constraints for implementing traceability are examined in the Greek fresh produce supply chain. The main objective is to identify the main factors affecting the implementation of traceability schemes, under the current supply chain structure and evaluate the theoretical framework identified in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A specific executive research was conducted, including interviews with key representatives of the sector. The scope of the research was to collect qualitative data with the aid of an unstructured questionnaire with no close-ended questions. The research sample included 22 agricultural cooperatives and private packinghouses located in northern Greece where the core value adding activities of the fresh produce supply chain are taking place. Northern Greece is of high importance for the examined sector as a high percentage of all value adding activities, from production to distribution, are taking place within this region. Findings: In the fresh produce supply chains ephemeral dynamic collaborations prevail which do not allow particular transparency with regard to the exchange of information between their members. Severe inequities recognized between supply chain members regarding their ability to imply traceability systems effectively, their current technological and operational status and the availability to undertake the cost of investment in such systems. Tight profit margins and inadequate knowledge on potential benefits of traceability systems are reported as some of the main factors that hinder investments on sophisticated traceability schemes. Adequate labeling automation with the implementation of machine-readable labeling technologies and the introduction of web-based technologies as a low cost solution are estimated to improve fresh produce traceability and logistics efficiency. Originality/value: Within a limited number of research papers on fresh produce traceability, there is no reference to the Greek produce sector. Thus, this paper progresses knowledge of the Greek produce industry regarding perspectives and key drivers for traceability implementation, supported by the thorough review of the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Data were obtained through: 1) questionnaires to a large group of cooperatives, 2) focus groups with a smaller number of cooperatives, and 3) personal interviews with union of cooperatives representatives. The findings indicate that the unions of cooperatives are working on issues such as registering and auditing cooperatives and resolving land ownership conflicts.

The emerging Farmer Professional Cooperatives (FPCs) are expected to facilitate vertical coordination. The overall goal of this study is to investigate the contractual arrangements between the FPCs and the buyers. Based on a national representative survey of 157 FPCs in China, this study shows that 32% of FPCs introduced written contracts in the primary marketing channel. Contracts are more likely to be adopted in the livestock sector and are positively related to the scale of production. While branding promotes contracts between FPCs and buyers, public certification of quality and food safety often substitutes for contracts. Furthermore, the membership heterogeneity of FPCs affects an FPC's decision to use contractual arrangements with the buyer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Fifty-five (out of 80) government employees involved in agricultural cooperatives’ empowerment and 85 (out of 277) board members of cooperatives who participated in empowerment programmes, were randomly selected to participate in this research. The perceptions of the two groups were compared using t-test to reach consensus. In the end 19 agreed definitions and 32 strategies were provided for empowering the cooperatives. An exploratory factor analysis was used to determine what sets of definitions and what sets of strategies hang together. The study results suggest that empowerment actors in Iran are trying to make cooperative principles governthe cooperative.

	abstract = {Purpose - As a major agricultural province in central China, Hubei Province mainly carries out the peasant household credit investigation system through rural credit cooperatives (RCCs). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the peasant household credit investigation system in Hubei RCCs and provide some evidence and ideas to the formulation of relevant policies. Design/methodology/approach - First, this paper briefly reviews the related literature of the efficiency in credit investigation system; second, the paper gives a brief description of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and designs the indicators for efficiency evaluation; third, the paper accounts data sources and processing methods; and finally, the paper performs the empirical analysis and draws a conclusion. Findings - The paper finds that the efficiency of the resource allocation in both regions is unoptimistic, the general efficiency is somewhat low, and it shows the trend of declination. The efficiency of pure technology in two regions represents the adverse trend. Every year's average scale efficiency in both regions is higher than the pure technology efficiency. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper include the first use of DEA model to practically evaluate the efficiency of credit investigation system based on 54 samples of RCCs in Hubei Province and the horizontal and vertical comparisons of the results. The conclusions of this paper not only make the efficiency of credit investigation system in the province's 54 credit cooperatives comparable but also has a great application value to the actual decision-making departments in formulating credit policies, and each credit cooperative in further building the credit investigation system according to its own conditions. Moreover, it has certain reference value to other similar studies. Copyright © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

Along with the election of a new board of directors that is now in charge of collective property, the reforms are redefining the jurisdiction of the party, the village government and the shareholding co-operative organisation, thus reconfiguring the political and economic power structure at the village level. © 2011 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

Aflatoxins were also detected and varied at the levels of 2.45-3.43 ng per g unhulled rice grain and 1.29-2.09 ng per g white rice grain. Unhulled rice generally detected higher level of aflatoxins than white rice regardless of sampling regions; however, no significant differences were found in Anseong and Cheonan in 2005 and Cheonan and Gimpo in 2007. Aflatoxin production between sampling regions was not different regardless of rice type and sampling year. Although the fungal diversity was highly distinct from region to region, three Aspergillus isolates were predominant in the rice samples; thus, representative isolates AC317, AF57, and AF8 were selected and identified based on their morphological and molecular characteristics. Consequently, isolates AC317, AF57, and AF8 were identified as A. candidus, A flavus, and A. fumigatus, respectively. These fungi can produce mycotoxins that are harmful for consumers and thus it is important to detect and reduce the population of storage fungi in rice. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.},

It also tries to identify the strategies used by cooperatives to deal with the local adversities, which provide them with particular dynamics. Do the cooperatives stimulate the mobilization of their members towards organizational and technological innovations? What is the impact in terms of increase of the social capital and advancement of the territories? In the analysis of these issues, the article examines a qualitative survey conducted in southern France, with reference to two case studies - Société Coopérative Agricole Fromagerie des Cévennes and Coopérative Origine Cévennes. In both cases, the emphasis has been on the know-how and leadership of the local agents, which are seen as "subjects of their own development," rather than "objects of study." The study reveals the limits and the power of a cooperative; even if it is separated by a considerable distance from the centers of distribution, and suffers from high operating costs, arid lands and infrastructure problems. These cases are particularly important to reinforce the importance of the cooperatives, especially in areas considered disadvantaged.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the role that local fruit varieties can play in achieving the dual objectives of food sovereignty and income generation in the Tajik Pamir Mountains. In this very harsh environment, agriculture is characterized by a great diversity of fruit varieties central to local food culture and household security. Local fruit trees can grow in poor soils on slopes and their resistance to diseases, cold, and ultraviolet light give them marked advantages over introduced varieties. However, the humanitarian crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union and recent efforts by development organizations to create markets by introducing exotic varieties are negatively affecting agricultural biodiversity (agrobiodiversity) and, potentially, household security. A study was carried out in 3 districts of the Gorno-Badakhshan province to investigate the household consumption and market potential of products derived from local varieties of apple, apricot, and mulberry and how these products could be better exploited to benefit community livelihoods and agrobiodiversity conservation. Results show that fruit represents the farmers' main source of food and income. Many local varieties are maintained for a variety of reasons related to household consumption, whereas the main reason for cultivating introduced varieties is income generation. Great care must therefore be taken in planning market strategies: a pure market focus will almost certainly endanger household security, whereas a strategy linking income generation through the commercialization of crop varieties to the promotion of qualities central to household needs will improve diversity and public health. The opportunities identified to help enhance the market potential of local fruits and maintain the Pamir's unique biocultural heritage include efforts to raise public awareness among producers and consumers of the nutritional and medicinal properties of local varieties; training for pest management, processing, and packaging; and the establishment of farmers' cooperatives. © 2011 International Mountain Society.},

	abstract = {Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision. Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However, extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for instance,wedo not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies, cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.},

A comparative analysis of antitrust regulation in Israel, the European Union and the United States shows that the exemption in Israel is relatively narrow with regard to the products included but much wider with regard to the exempted firms. There are economic arguments which support exempting farmers and farmers' associations from the prohibition of restrictive arrangements to enable cooperation in production, marketing, promotion and research, but the exemption of wholesalers of agricultural products could not be justified on the grounds of economic efficiency.},

Thus, it was necessary to analyze how the agricultural cooperatives of Rio Grande do Sul measure the financial risk, checking on the background the perception of doctrinal principles. The research used a structured questionnaire and case studies. As results, the cooperatives can understand, in general scope, the importance of risk management. However, when asked about the degree of indebtedness, they showed mixed opinions. Therefore, it is noted that the main difficulty of this type of organization is to find, within a capitalist economy, a balance between the social and the economic aspect.},

Through successful negotiations, several actors were enlisted until a network of relations shaped up. Negotiations and networks anchored on the cooperatives and as facilitated or managed by the intermediaries (mainly the NIZ Management Staff and field technicians from the PCC), have resulted in integrative agreements regarding adoption of particular innovations, marketing strategies, and policy implementation. Continuous improvement and sustainability of the NIZ Program depends on the effective management of its network. Strategic alliance with other actors or private groups to help in the business aspect of the NIZ operations is also recommended.},

However, critics have exposed certifications' inability to secure independence, quality, consumer trust, and costs. Recent criticism is even more pointed in that some theorists have critiqued " alternative" systems such as Fair Trade as neoliberal window-dressing. What is curious about this emerging literature is how little has been said about the role of citizens. Although most of the certification literature has assumed that food certification resides in the exclusive realm of " experts" and that technical sophistication is equated with improvement, I argue that democratization is possible and desirable. This paper draws on a case study of a Japanese consumer cooperative which has conducted a laywomen's food certification system for past ten years. By proposing at least two parameters of evaluation of food certification-redistributive effect and the degree of democratization, the paper expands the imaginary of " politics of the possible" in food governance while acknowledging tension of gendered participation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Built by activists and NGOs, these systems were adopted by agribusiness. Such firms try to capture consumers and react to opinion campaigns, whilst appropriating the conservation (or 'fair') discourse. This leads to the rise of new forms of third-party certifications of food production based on private standards and, hence, to new forms of contract relations between producers and buyers. The nature of these relationships is not always evident in these new labels or in the discourse built to justify them. This is particularly so in the case of goods produced in the South to be traded and sold in the North, as the case of Starbucks illustrates. By the end of the 1990s, Starbucks, operating through an NGO called Conservation International (CI), arrived at the region of El Triunfo, in Chiapas, and contacted the producers' cooperatives that were trying to find a market for their product. CI promoted Starbucks standards to raise the coffee quality and won the control over the production system. Meanwhile, the producers forced to sell their coffee through the largest trade company (AMSA) against whom the cooperatives were created, lost the control over their own organization. When some cooperatives refused the deal, they suffered divisions but could survive thanks the Fair Trade (FT) network in Chiapas. © Springer 2010.},

This paper discusses the behavior of farmers and their cooperatives in determining the optimal share of profits in their contracts. It also illustrates the impacts of the policy changes due to the Korea's accession to the WTO on the relative negotiation power between farmers and cooperatives. The results show that the Korean rice cooperatives have more negotiation power than farmers. They set the profit share to farmers based on their own profit maximization criteria, while taking farmers supply decision into consideration. Farmers only choose how much to supply. This relationship was seen changing after 2005, when the Korean government reduced and removed the price subsidy it provided to rice cooperatives before. As the cooperatives' margin goes down without the subsidy, farmers are pushed to bargain hard for their share of the margin to maintain their revenue.},

Altruistic reasons are found to be the most influential, with the act of volunteering also scoring highly. This knowledge should inform volunteer recruitment programmes and internal appraisal processes as management can reinforce messages that provide positive feedback to volunteers on the social benefits being achieved by the credit union. This will further motivate current volunteers, ensuring retention. When motivation was analyzed by volunteer characteristics we found that older volunteers, retired volunteers and volunteers who are less educated are more motivated in their role.

Ripe fruits have high sugar contents, which can be easily processed to ethanol. The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the production potential of ethanol from Musa spp. discard and to analyze the energy and carbon (C) footprints of this production system using a life cycle approach. The study compared three case studies differing in management practices, which were (I) a coffee producer's cooperative in Costa Rica using Musa spp. as shade trees, (II) organic banana producers from Ecuador, and (III) conventional banana producers from Ecuador. It was found that banana and cooking banana discard accumulated at a rate of 1.4-3.4 t ha-1, of which around 118-266 l ethanol could be produced on a yearly basis. The case study from Costa Rica yielded a net-energy balance (NEB) of 19.3 MJ l-1 and avoided carbon emissions of 0.48 kg l-1. It was closely followed by the organic banana producers from Ecuador with a NEB of 17.1 MJ l-1 and avoided carbon emissions of 0.44 kg l-1. NEB and avoided carbon emissions for the conventional banana farms in Ecuador were much lower (7.2 MJ l-1 and 0.34 kg l-1).Despite providing economic benefits to farmers through a biomass source that would have been otherwise lost, the study gave clear evidence that the ecological footprint of this ethanol production system is significantly influenced by the resource use during the production life cycle. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Territorial development involves the organized participation of social actors in decisions regarding the use of the public - and, largely, private - resources of a region. Despite the obvious democratic virtues of the participatory processes, there has been a recent increase in the critical literature, questioning their results. This paper intends to reveal the tension experienced by the contemporary social movements: the conflict between representativeness and innovation. Representative movements tend to consolidate and strengthen interests, and their institutionalization pushes them towards routine attitudes that often block their innovative potential. One way out of the impasses of the social movements is in the terms of management of the social participation focused explicitly on learning and innovation. Organizations coming from social movements are an essential part of the participatory processes. This article, based on the example of the Brazilian policy of strengthening family agriculture, examines two of those organizations whose origin is in the social movements: the Federação dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura Familiar - FETRAF (Federation of Workers in Family Farming), which is a trade union; and the CRESOL System of cooperatives for credit outreach. Both organizations stimulate participatory processes and are associated with government policies. In the case of the trade union, however, social participation does not result in innovation, and the ties with the government tend to restrict the movement to relations already known. As regards the credit cooperative, social participation and ties with the government are the result of incentives that encourage the strengthening of what the new economic sociology calls weak ties, and thus open the way to expand the very foundations of the processes of local development.},

	abstract = {The production planning in agriculture is one of the most important decision problems of the farmer. Although some decision support tools based mainly on linear programming and addressed to agriculture authorities were presented, their direct application by a farmer is not possible. This is mainly due to the local character of the models developed for particular agricultural conditions and also due to the complexness of underlying mathematical programming models. This paper aims to develop dynamic programming model for the long run crop plan optimization covering the typical conditions of Czech farms, which could serve as a platform for further enlargements and changes according to needs and conditions of particular farm. The dynamic programming algorithm is developed in detail for model case of four areas to be planted by four crops each year. The possibility of covering different constraints by generating the state space is discussed, and the generating procedure for crop rotation rules is shown. The goal function reflects the farmers objective of profit maximization and it is defined with respect to harvests' randomness. The case study is solved for the data from South Moravian agriculture cooperative and the optimal solution is presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {In 1948, when the State of Israel was founded, 125,000 people (about one fifth of the Jewish population) were members of credit cooperative societies, which provided over 20 percent of all market financing. For several years this number continued to rise, reaching a total of 250,000 members in more than 100 credit cooperative societies. Credit associations - part of the thriving cooperative movement of early Zionism - symbolized the attempt to create a new and just Jewish society by fusing socialist and capitalist ideals. From the mid-1950s, however, in a rapid process of centralization of Israel's capital market and financial institutions, almost all credit associations were absorbed into Israel's commercial banks and dissolved. Today, Israel's two largest banks (Leumi and Hapoalim) control over 63 percent of credit provision, and 90 percent of credit is provided to less than 1 percent of borrowers. The official policy of the Bank of Israel is to rule out the establishment of credit associations, credit unions or other non-bank financial institutions. In the light of current renewed interest in "social businesses," i.e., innovative business models designed to achieve desired social outcomes, this Article traces the waning of credit associations in Israel, and the role law has played in that process. Their disappearance from the capital market marked not only a change in economic policy, but also the final abandonment of the ideals which underlay the provision of cooperative financial services: mutuality, partnership and solidarity.

With the objective of responding to several of the most important questions facing agriculture today, this article describes recent research in three Cuban cropping systems: state farms, cooperatives, and small family farmers. Soil management is considered here as a crux of human intervention in agroecosystems, capable of determining the impacts of productive activities upon agricultural and ecosystem functions. Management practices commonly used in each farm system are evaluated using two systems of indicators, one for technological quality and one for agricultural intensification. Soil physical quality is characterized through laboratory analysis of samples taken in the same type of soil under long-term production in state, cooperative, and family farmer cropping systems. Soil structure management in the small farmer system is especially worthy of study, because this agricultural system has developed an intensive agroecological productive model on the basis of low external input use, polycultures and internal nutrient cycling. Favorable policies and farmer organizations are discussed as indispensible elements of sustainable agricultural development. The relationships between soil management, local knowledge, and food access are explored in the Cuban context and as directions for food system studies. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {This study seeks to determine farmers preferences for firms, dealers or cooperatives in terms of economic and social benefits. The economic benefits criteria include the level of profit each enterprise type is able to generate for farmers, and the risk protection and marketing advantages each affords to farmers. The study also compared the social benefits that farmers derive from cooperatives and other agricultural organizations. Data were collected from 203 farmers, in six provinces: Tire, Odemis, Kemalpasa, Seferihisar, Foca and Urla in the Aegean region of Turkey, using face-to-face interviews. The study employed the following two different analytic hierarchy process AHP models to determine the enterprise preferences of farmers: Model 1 assessed farmer's enterprise preferences in terms of high profit, low risk and marketing advantages. Model 2 evaluated farmers' enterprise and organization preferences in terms of social benefits, human development and democratic participation. Model 1 indicates that farmers prefer cooperatives (score of 0.632) over firms and dealers. Firms and dealers were assigned preferences scores of 0.239 and 0.129, respectively. In Model 2, farmers prefer cooperatives (0.491). The chamber of farmers and extension were assigned preference scores of 0.273 and 0.236, respectively. In conclusion, farmers still have confidence in the ability of cooperatives to provide the market-related services they need and opportunities for social development and democratic expression. These results may also indicate farmers' satisfaction with their role and influence in determining cooperative governance and modus operandi. Additionally, farmers' positive attitudes and confidence in cooperatives may also be an expression of deeply held values rooted in cultural and institutional traditions of collaboration and group action at the village level over many decades.},

The government benefited from the experience of other countries but replicated none. Instead it came up with an innovation: cooperative self-help under state control, seemingly a contradiction.

Regulation and supervision have been the state's instruments for assuring good performance, avoiding the disaster of the previous credit cooperative sector. The network overall has proved resilient during the global crisis, but with some differences between the rural PCFs and their central fund, which in addition to liquidity exchange also provides retail services in urban areas. © Practical Action Publishing, 2010.},

I test the effectiveness of social movement theories in explaining this phenomenon by examining frequency and intensity of protest from 1980-1995. I find that grievance models have little explanatory power, political opportunity accounts for the frequency of protest, and resource mobilization offers insight into both frequency and intensity of protests. Supplementing existing theories, I offer qualitative evidence that development programs designed to restructure agricultural cooperatives created mobilizing structures. The reforms were intended to help family farmers adapt to the new market economy, but because most protests targeted liberalization policies, I conclude that in their short-term success, development agencies inadvertently subsidized the cost of collection action against their long-term goals. © The Author 2012.

Emphasis is on localised food networks and connection between socially as well as environmentally sustainable production, distribution and consumption. Investigated is the premise that cooperative organisational structures, for reasons of their long-term socially responsible origins are at the forefront of development of local and sustainable food systems and are thereby in a position to offer a specific contribution to market development. Two key research questions are proposed: Firstly, is there a pre-determination of cooperatives to issues of sustainable and local food sourcing given the historical and practical context of their ethical/socially responsible and stakeholder-based business model? Secondly, do co-ops express support for re-localising food systems and what contribution do they make concerning sustainable food and their relationships with local food suppliers? The method of investigation is through a two country retailer co-operative sector analysis and comparison (Finland and Italy). The enquiry is qualitative and exploratory in nature in the form of an embedded, multiple case design. The paper makes practical and theoretical contribution to knowledge concerning interpretation of ‘localness’ in food, the role of co-operatives and the co-operative ethos in sustainable food systems and the development of the local food economy. Results of the study show a positive relationship between co-operative ethos and (social) sustainability in local food, but the de-centralised nature of retailer co-operation also provides a barrier to replication of good practice. © 2011.

For both objectives and satisfaction, the directors and the cooperative members who depend upon agricultural activity for a large percentage of their income have higher scores, compared with non-board members and members who are less dependent on agricultural activity (with a statistical significance of 1% and 5%, respectively). We also find that members who agree in more with the admission of new members, who think it is easy to recover their investments and who want to stay longer in the cooperative are those who are more willing to invest and to exert control. Furthermore, we find that members that prefer to have a participation in the assembly proportional to their contribution and that prefer that the cooperative diversifies more are those who are more willing to invest. In addition, control is favoured by members pertaining to the cooperative for a large period and for those members who think that investing in the cooperative is a high risk and who prefer long-term investments. Finally, directors are more willing to invest and to exert control.},

Model region comprises cadastral areas of Hlinné, Vyšný Žipov and Zlatník village. They are situated at the contact zone of two genetically distinct entities: Panónska panva basin and the Carpathians. It is a markedly heterogenous area, which has undergone considerable changes from the aspect of landscape heterogeneity development, particularly under the influence of collectivisation of agricultural production, industrialisation, development of communication networks and with that connected rise of built-up areas. The agriculture of the area and also landuse since 1826 has undergone considerable changes. There are agrarian terraces and ramparts, the oldest relics of the agricultural land use, which remained after farming on small fields, respectively plots. From an analysis of historical sources and results of field research can be concluded that the landscape preserved this character till early 50-ties of the 20 th century. The formation of agricultural cooperatives in the region and with this related intensification of agricultural production led to the disappearanc of agrarian terraces and ramparts on the one side by inclusion of them into forest communities in areas with higher slope. The agrarian terraces and ramparts have been preserved only in areas with the most exposed slope at the foothills of Slanské vrchy Mts in Zlatník and Vyšný Žipov in Beskydské predhorie hilly-land. Our presented methodology appears appropriate for evaluation of the heterogeneity of other rural landscape with occurrence of historical landscape structures not only in Central Europe.},

The Bangladesh Milk Producers' Cooperatives Union Ltd (or 'Milk Vita' as its brand name) is the only cooperative operating in all over the country. This study was conducted in the Baghabarighat Milk Shed Area (BMSA) situated in Sirajgonj and Pabna district under Milk Vita. Five sub-districts, namely Shahjadpur, Faridpur, Ullahpara, Sathia and Bera and 30 villages under those sub-districts were selected. The selection of different sub-districts were based on in order of the distance from the Milk Vita centre (Shahjadpur is the closest and Bera is the most far). Three hundred sample dairy farmers were selected randomly. The data were collected by using pre-tested and pre-designed structured questionnaire by face-to-face interview. The results showed that about 98% of the dairy cattle are cross bred (Pabna Milking Cows with Holstein Friesian, Shahiwal, and Jersey). It has also been observed that the highest number of both total and milk cattle are available in Shahjadpur. Concerning the management practices such as use of concentrates, water use, and use of artificial insemination are better-off in Shahjadpur. This is due to the fact that this area is situated very close to the Milk Vita Centre and accordingly has better access to the centre and has more knowledge about the management and also gets higher services which are beneficial to them. This study suggests to adopt a strategic planning by the Milk Vita management board to implement a harmonised and standard management and breeding programme for all the farmers independent of the distance from the centre.},

However, what is missing in Global Commodity Chain (GCC) and Global Value Chain (GVC) analyses is an explanation of how governance structures change over time. In this paper I suggest that the production system associated with particular commodities is not the only factor shaping commodity chain governance. Rather, I argue that actors' strategies, regulation, and historical trajectories also influence and, in certain conjunctures, transform chain governance. Since regulations and actor strategies in competitive environments change over time, it follows that chain governance is dynamic. Drawing from the case of the Dutch cut flower agro-industry, the world's leading supplier of cut flowers, I build on the GCC, GVC and Global Production Network (GPN) literatures to illustrate how actor strategies, regulation and the historical trajectory of the Dutch cut flower GCC shape and change chain governance. What the Dutch cut flower case illustrates is how grower strategies and government policy facilitated the formation of grower cooperatives, and transformed the power relations between growers and buyers in a shift from a buyer to a producer-driven chain. © 2010 Clark University.},

	abstract = {The issues of food security and family sustenance have been a major problem in recent times. A large number of the urban populace has not been able to provide the food need of their family. Due to urban expansion, there is limited or no land for subsistence farming. The few that have the opportunity withdrew due to pilfering and competing time for office work, home and the farm. In order to deal with the crisis, civil servants formed cooperative societies which engaged in the bulk purchase of food items for the co-operators. The bill of food items purchased serves as loans which were deducted from their salaries. The study examines the effectiveness of cooperative societies in ensuring household food security and sustainability of civil servants in urban cities of Ondo state. A total of 180 civil servants were randomly selected and interviewed for the study. Findings show that majority 48.33% of the respondents patronize the consumer cooperative societies monthly to purchase the food need of the family, while 32.78% patronize the societies quarterly. The most important reason for patronizing being getting cheaper food prices than the market price and the ease of payment. Some at the end of the month, after all deductions made from their salaries, rarely have something to take home but believe in a Yoruba adage which says 'Tebi bati kuro ninu ise, ise buse ' literarily meaning that when hunger is out of poverty, then poverty is drastically reduced. Result of the probit model reveals a significant relationship between consumers' cooperatives and household food security, a positive significant relationship between educational status, income and food security. However, there is a negative relationship between family size and food security, indicating that the higher the family size, the greater the level of food insecurity.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on winter wheat, based on real agricultural practices databases, on a sample divided into four production scenarios. The main objectives of this study are (1) to assess the environmental impact of winter wheat, using an LCA covering field practices, and the transport and storage of grain until it is sold to a miller; (2) to use the USEtox model (Rosenbaum, et al.. in Int J Life Cycle Assess 13:532-546, 2008) to assess the part of the total freshwater ecotoxicity impact due to pesticide use, its variability among plots, and to identify the active ingredients with the strongest impact; (3) and with the help of fungicide, insecticide, herbicide experts, to identify active ingredients to replace these high-impact pesticides and estimate the effect of such a substitution on total freshwater ecotoxicity. Materials and methods: InVivo (the authors' company) is a French union of agricultural cooperatives that produces and sells, amongst other products and services, decision-making tools to help farmers manage fertilization and pesticide applications. With the help of cooperatives and with the help of these tools, pedologic, climatologic and agronomic (in particular for fertilization and pesticide applications practices) data can be collected for each agricultural plot of a farm. Results and discussion: The main conclusions of this study are that : (1) when considering freshwater ecotoxicity impacts, pesticide use is predominant on the whole life cycle of winter wheat, (2) there is a huge scattering of the results observed between fields when compared to the low scattering of the results between the four production scenarios, (3) it is feasible, with the USEtox model, to identify the active ingredients with the strongest impact and to potentially decrease this average impact by 50% by substituting only three active ingredients. Conclusions: A further step to improve ecotoxicity assessment in LCA would be to develop a model to better estimate the pesticide emissions pattern on field, taking into account pedo-climatic conditions and farmers' practices. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

An important strand of this 'new institutionalism' is historical institutionalism. Recent theoretical developments have sought to address the most obvious criticisms of the historical institutionalist approach, particularly the critique relating to its tendency to focus on explanations of stability. However, the institutional histories under consideration are generally incomplete as they do not include the entire life of the institution. Drawing on the history of collective wheat marketing in Australia, this article seeks to address this gap by considering a case in which strategies of institutional reproduction initially appeared to have managed change successfully but ultimately sowed the seeds of institutional demise. By considering the death as well as the life of an institution, we can gain a clearer picture of the effectiveness of institutional strategies of adaptation and change. © 2010 The Author.

	abstract = {The international financial crisis has been the catalyst for a profound change in financial supervision and its business model. In the case of Europe, the size of the banking industry demands severe adjustment. This article analyzes recent reorganization processes within the banking sector that have been undertaken, or that have at least been recently initiated, by national entities (savings banks and credit cooperatives). Their special territorial basis, which has theoretically been compatible with a strong geographical expansion process, has led to application of the legal formula of the "Institutional Protection System (IPS)" that was suggested by the European Union only months before the international financial crisis arose. This new method of business concentration is presented as an alternative to mergers and acquisitions. With this in mind the article first looks at how the environment has been affected by the consequences of the crisis within the sector. It goes on to present the IPS that have been initiated and implemented until now, looking at specific cases within the European credit cooperatives sector and analyzing the Spanish sector econometrically.},

Many cooperatives try to adapt to novel consumer demands by engaging more in product development, with the aim of manufacturing and selling more differentiated products. The article discusses which governance problems that are likely to unfold as cooperatives engage more in the development, production and sales of differentiated end-products. The idea to be advanced is that the nature of the governance problems is contingent on where in the cooperative's production chain the main sources of uniqueness and product differentiation have their origin. When the uniqueness of the end-product is created at the raw-commodity level (on-farm), haggling over appropriable quasi-rent between members and the cooperative is likely to emerge, leading to a hold-up situation. When the uniqueness of the differentiated end-product is created at the cooperative level, the cooperative community is likely to be exposed to consequential incentive problems related to motivation and control. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

A total of 50 agribusinesses comprising 33 primary production businesses and 17 agro-processing businesses were randomly selected for the study. A set of both closed and open-ended questionnaires was used to collect data on agribusinesses. The results from the study revealed that primary production was creating more employment opportunities as compared to agro-processing. However, gross margin analysis showed that the mean gross margin was higher in agro-processing when compared with primary production businesses. The main constraints facing agribusinesses were: lack of working capital, lack of management skills, and marketing related problems. Financial support and skills training were identified as necessary strategies to overcome lack of working capital, management skills, while the problem of marketing could be solved by the creation of a marketing co-operative in the area. The study findings revealed that performance of agribusinesses depended on the management style, capital invested, final product produced, income generated and employment generated. Policy makers need to formulate policies accordingly for success and sustainability of agribusinesses as poverty reduction strategies. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

The results of our evaluation of the ability of Fair Trade to meet its objectives indicate that Fair Trade's opportunities to provide a significant price premium for participating farmers largely depend on world coffee prices in mainstream markets. While Fair Trade has promoted premiums for social development for participating producers and strengthened the institutional capacities of the cooperatives involved, its ability to enhance significantly the working conditions of hired coffee laborers remains limited. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Several studies exist on the causes and effects of poor water quality, and on possible solutions for effluent control in these two economically important production systems. However, only a small number of Vietnamese farms apply these reduction options, raising questions over the state-enforced compliance with legislated water-quality measures. Voluntary standards and certification networks have recently emerged as alternative forms of water-quality governance in Vietnamese aquaculture. This paper examines a number of ongoing and interlinked international, national and community level initiatives on (voluntary) standards and certification that aim to promote sustainable shrimp and pangasius aquaculture in Vietnam. The results indicate the potential, but also challenges, in the development and implementation of national and international standards and demonstrate the need for more attention to the role of local institutions like producer co-operatives in multi-level governance arrangements. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Experimental field is located in the maize production area (climatic region: warm; climatic sub region dry; climatic zone: warm, dry with mild winter and long sunshine) in altitude 250 m above sea level, with brown soil. We observed the influence of both temperature and moisture conditions of experimental area on sunflower yield of achenes (conventional, medium-late hybrids: NK Brio, NK Armoni). Preceding crop of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) every experimental year was wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Technological system of sunflower cultivation was realized in accordance with conventional technology of cultivation. The basic fertilization was made by balance method on the base of agrochemical soil analysis for expected yield 3 t.ha-1. The meteorological data were got out from agrometeorological station of the Central Controlling and Testing Institute in Agriculture in Vel'ke Ripňany. During every experimental year the change of inner energy (ΔU) was evaluated for thermodynamic characteristic analysis (security of the temperature and moisture) and the impact of changes on yield forming with maximal yield (Ymaxin 2008) and minimal yield (Ymin in 2009). Achieved value of yield from thermal and precipitation energy introduces concrete energy amount, which is available in given period for concrete height of yield. From the results follow, the sunflower has got critical thermodynamic phase in the period of months from July to August. For the yield formation is requirement, that input power of precipitation prevailed over the thermal during moths July to August. Achieved results confirmed statistically high significant dependence of the yield on weather conditions and for high annual variations in climatic characteristics the consideration is needed about potential changes some agrotechnological measures of technological system of sunflower cultivation.},

Results show the tendency for Black churches to sponsor economic programs to meet more short-term needs rather than address systemic issues. Moreover, findings from logistic regression modeling suggest limited denominational effects, but a positive relationship between churches that espouse a more liberative stance and economic program sponsorship-particularly programs associated with more long-term benefits. Furthermore, Black churches that offer more educational and contemplative religious programs and that have the requisite human resources and organizational structure appear best positioned to offer these economic programs.

In this study, insolvency was classified as the cooperative wich: failed to send statements to the Central Bank of Brazil, had negative equity or negative adjusted net worth, or even if it were classified in the following situations by the Central Bank of Brazil: paralyzed, in liquidation, canceled/closed and in ordinary liquidation. From a database of 9,456 observations collected from a sample of 112 cooperatives affiliated to Sicoob-Crediminas between January 1995 and May 2008, a set of Logit class models were estimated. The results obtained with the best fit allow us to infer that the financial ratios “Allowance for Loan Losses/ Allowances Required for Overdue Loans”, “Non-Financial Investments/Total Assets”, “Non-Earning Assets/Total Assets”, and “Services Income/ Managerial Expenses” were the most relevant in determining the likelihood of insolvency of cooperatives in our sample. These results support the hypothesis that the monitoring of financial accounting ratios of the Pearls system, which has not been the focus of the traditional analysis of balance sheets, is important for determining the probability of insolvency of credit unions, assisting their managers in identifying risk factors, as well as in creating a benchmark for comparing the performance of cooperatives, facilitating the supervision process by regulators. However, expansion of the estimated results for subsequent periods and other credit unions in Brazil must be done carefully, with alternative specifications to be evaluated in order to capture changes in the economic and administrative structure of the cooperatives, which may influence their accounting and financial indicators. © 2011 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

This paper discussed the livelihood impacts of oil palm development in Indonesia, based on lessons learnt from Bungo district, in the province of Jambi. The various community-company partnerships that structure the sector are reviewed and the difficulties raised by the joint ventures schemes are discussed. The merits and drawbacks of oil palm as a smallholder crop are then analysed, based on household socio-economic surveys conducted in 2007-2010. The main causes of conflicts between oil palm companies and communities are unclear land tenure, and a recurrent lack of leadership in smallholders' cooperatives. Under fair partnerships between smallholders and companies, oil palm could become a smallholder friendly crop. The land-use profitability analysis demonstrates the high returns that can be generated by oil palm independent smallholdings, making it highly competitive with rubber, and much more profitable than rice production. © 2010 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

The study determines the economic income from Fairtrade coffee throughout the chain as well as exploring the benefits and consequences of Fairtrade for local producers in Nicaragua and Guatemala. Our analysis shows that consumer countries acquire the larger share of economic income, mainly because Fairtrade is positioned within the conventional market where large multinationals control the supply chain. The participation of large multinationals has led to increasing pressure and tough competition for the certified producer cooperatives in the Fairtrade market. On the consumer side, while consumer marketing narratives emphasize producer benefits of Fairtrade, our results demonstrate that its total benefits for primary producers is modest. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

Firstly, the financing of cooperative firms does not seem to be favored by credit cooperatives. By contrast, and this is the second finding, a synergetic relationship exists between commercial banks and cooperative firms, as it is from this typology of banks that cooperatives seem to receive more credit. Finally, cooperative firms are less likely to receive bank loans in less competitive local credit markets, even though this impact is decreasing for less opaque firms. © International Economic Society.},

However, what the Party has not wanted reformed, and has fought strongly on behalf of, is culture. Using primary source official CPV cultural policy documentation and secondary sources highlighting contemporary meanings of Vietnamese and foreign cultures, this paper evaluates the Party's use of culture as a resource in the direction and regulation of the nation's market economy with a socialist orientation. While culture is expedient for all governments, I argue that the CPV's intent is unique in that it uses culture as an instrument to maintain its ownership, rather than simply to legitimize its regulatory ability, over the national political economy. This paper aims to show how culture is part and parcel of post-socialist governance's political-economic framework and contributes to debates surrounding the reach and impact of neoliberalism in formerly command economies. © 2011.},

A sample of 44 households with commercial poultry farms were surveyed through structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, linear and logit regression models. The results revealed that men participated more on management activities such as vaccination, administration of drugs, debeaking and chicks procurement while women were more engaged in daily routine activities like cleaning of pens, provision of water, sorting of eggs etc. Furthermore women enjoyed about 53.6% level of involvement in farm decision making and only about 28.7% rate of accessibility to farm resources. Major determinants of the rate of accessibility of resources by women were flock size, years of experience, primary occupation, access to credit, cooperative participation and level of income. The determinants of decision making among women are age, years of experience, occupation, cooperative membership and income level. The study recommends that poultry production activities which have been identified to be of interest to women must be used as an avenue for empowering them. Input subsidies and credit facilities must be made available and easily accessible by the women. The women must be given maximum consideration with regards to extension service to inform, educate and train them on the use of recommended practices and technologies. They should be encouraged to participate in cooperative society in order to leverage the opportunity of access to farm resources.},

The application's theoretical background lies on the Traceability Data Pool (TDP) model described in the literature and aims to offer a practical solution for traceability support, especially for the stakeholder operating in the supply chain base, such as the farmers and agricultural cooperatives. This activity-oriented web application connects field treatments with the rest of the supply chain without implementing additional physical labelling. This application aims at integrating the existent labelling systems implemented in different levels of the supply chain, under a common standard virtual crop codification following the produce along the supply chain, from farm to fork, thus achieving total traceability.

The focus is on the privatisation of the management of city markets and on the relations between the multiple actors involved-private contractors, vendors' associations, cooperatives and state actors. In particular, the paper looks into the implications of the privatisation process for vendors and their associations. It argues that, while the latter have sometimes adjusted to the changes by turning into cooperative societies or creating their own management firms, increasingly, however, private interests external to the markets are taking over the management functions, sidelining or even repressing, vendors' associations. The general picture is one of weakening associations and endangered possibilities for broad-based organising and interest representation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

By presenting cases of the Tohoku region-one of the main paddy rice-producing regions in Japan-the spatial distribution of new rice varieties after the 1990s is recapitulated as follows: (1) at the regional level, distinct regional differentiation appeared with the emergence of main rice varieties in each prefecture; (2) at the prefecture level, planted areas of paddy rice decreased and the percentage of the main rice variety increased; and (3) throughout the regional and prefectural levels, the naming of new rice varieties was simplified and generalized. In the process of development and distribution of the new varieties of paddy rice, some conditions are considered as the commodification of the paddy rice-producing centers: (1) corresponding with recent market demands, new varieties with good flavor were constantly bred and spread; (2) values of some of the new varieties increased by being designated as "regional brand-name varieties"; and (3) the primary new rice varieties were introduced simultaneously by individual farms according to marketing strategies developed by prefectural and municipal administrations and agricultural cooperatives. As for future proposals, the regional riceproducing centers will have to cooperate with small and medium-size enterprises that have the singular technology to produce new varieties. Agricultural subsidies to address the aging of farmers and increasing idle farmland are also needed. ©2010 The Association of Japanese Geographers.},

In Petrolina and Juazeiro, the highest productivity rates are achieved in cultivating grapes and mangos, considered the principal fruits for the export market. The infrastructure in the irrigated perimeters includes the availability of water and electric power supply for both large and small producers alike. In Vale do Açu, the 1969 construction of the Armando Ribeiro Gonçalves Dam, with holding capacity of up to 2.7 billion liters of water, sought to enhance conditions for local residents by settling them on the land and making it possible for them to engage in agricultural production in the irrigated perimeter of the Lower Açu River. This region is the biggest producer of bananas in the entire country. In addition, for 8 years now, the Ceará-Mirim Valley has been the location of a farming cooperative called Agrovila Canudos, where 120 families are settled on an area measuring 1.3 thousand hectares. At present, just 19 families work in the cooperative and obtain satisfactory results in irrigated agriculture and other projects, such as fish-farming and cultivation of Jatropha curcas (physic nut) shrubs for use in the production of biodiesel fuel. © 2009 WIT Press.},

Approximately 35-40% of people from this unemployment group have already no more chance to be reintegrated into the labour market. The analysis points to out the regional occurrence of this type of unemployment (less urbanised sub-mountain areas, stagnating and backward regions facing various processes of de-industrialisation, etc) and evaluates its wider socio-economic impacts. After 2000, the fragmentation of employment contracts in the corporative types of farms (agricultural co-operatives and companies) begins to appear in the agricultural sector. The category of seasonal agricultural workers with decreased labour and social protection begins to emerge as well. As a result of the strategy to cope with the situation, a certain self-supplying (subsistence farming) subculture was established in the Slovak rural areas to mitigate the difficult economic conditions of the rural households endangered by income deprivation, including the decreased purchasing power of rural populalion.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the influence costs problem in the governance structure "agribusiness cooperative." Influence costs are higher in cooperatives than in investor-oriented firms due to the unique governance structure of the former. Hypotheses are formulated and tested regarding the relationship between influence costs and seven variables: membership size, member heterogeneity, average member age, singleness of purpose, managerial power over members, level of managerial compensation, and professional versus inside management. The main results are that heterogeneous member preferences, older average member age, and investment in multiple product lines all contribute to higher influence costs. At the same time, cooperatives with well-paid, powerful, and professional managers incur lower influence costs. The impact of membership size on the level of influence costs is undetermined. © 2010 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Newly emerging nations in the developing world put great efforts into developing multi-purpose co-operative societies that, it was hoped, would bring the benefits of development to the rural poor. With some exceptions these failed to live up to expectations; having been created by governments they remained controlled by the interests of government, party and civil service. Then, under structural adjustment programmes they either collapsed or were reformed. Some new, more genuine co-operative sectors are now emerging. As they do, co-operatives face new challenges brought about by continuing processes of economic globalisation, the IT revolution, and changes in the national and international balance of powers. To survive and thrive, the ability for co-operative organisations to network effectively at both the local level and beyond is becoming increasingly important. This paper seeks to examine the relevance of the numerous theoretical perspectives on network formation and network management to the newly-emerging co-operative sectors in the developing world. Such networks are being built both within the co-operative sector itself (e.g. through federation) and with a range of other bodies, each locally, nationally and internationally. The paper seeks to provide a framework for understanding the processes that drive the formation of relationships, networks and partnerships, and asks questions of how such alliances can be governed and managed effectively. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether or not financial repression exists in the saving and investment activities of farm households in rural areas of China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically investigates repression in rural China using the McKinnon-Shaw model and microeconomic data combined with lending and savings rates and ceilings by rural credit cooperatives. Findings - The paper finds only limited evidence of a repression dominated by savings, while investment response appears to be, at least on average, normal or unrepressed. More specifically, the paper finds that the relationship between growth and investment is consistent with an unrepressed economy but savings do show evidence of repression. Originality/value - The political focus of economic reformation in China has been one of rapid economic growth in urban areas and a neglect of the agriculture sector. This focus on urban growth has led some Chinese scholars to speculate that the residual impact is a repressed agricultural and rural economy, at least in the context of McKinnon and Shaw framework. However, such speculations have not previously been verified. This paper presents the first attempt to determine the relationships exclusively in the context of the agricultural economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Hence, I offer a reflexive ethnographic description of "short-life" co-op living based on a five year account of managing vacant properties that await refurbishment or re-development by two major Charitable Housing Trusts based in West London. In questioning how tenants deal with the constant threat of having to move, I ask how members of a short-life housing co-op create their own sense of self and stability through a temporary form of accommodation. My goal is thus to investigate how these co-op tenants appropriate space, relocate themselves and cope with transient domestic alienability. The creative formulation of individual and community identities are central to the wider understanding and implications of residential instability, alternative lifestyles and the general underlying ethos of co-operative organizations. © 2008 by the American Anthropological Association.

The authorities of implementation, including the Reserve Bank of India, operate under the presumption that the financial inclusion initiatives have trickled down automatically to the lowest administrative unit at village level and have brought respite into the lives of the hitherto financially excluded sections. However, reality on the ground is entirely different and the situation remains unchanged. Since these measures have had hadly any impct on the financially excluded sections of society, the incidence of financial abandonment remains unchanged at the lowest administrative unit. Surprisingly, people at the grass root level are not familiar and have not even lieard about the financial inclusion measures. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect the necessary change to occur in the absence of any financial institution, like commercial bank or cooperative society at lowest administration unit level. Also, the conspicuous absence of rural credit cooperative societies and selfhelp group organizations has further worsened the situation in rural areas. This paper, besides identifying the failures of the financial inclusion measures from the perspective of the lowest administrative unit, attempts to bring the demand side factors to the forefront, including the business potential that exists for financial institutions, and effective administration of financial services by the formal financial system and other newly emerged institutions like self-help groups.},

In South Africa, renewed interest in development-oriented cooperatives saw the introduction of a new Cooperatives Act in 2005, along with support measures dedicated to 'emerging' cooperatives. This paper contends that the architects of the new Act discounted important trends in international legislation that would have made development-oriented cooperatives more versatile and given their members better access to capital and expertise through equity partnerships with private agribusiness firms. It is concluded that the new Act should be amended to admit non-patron investors as members, and to allow for non- redeemable and hence appreciable and tradable shares. Such innovations are emerging internationally, usually with a cap on non-patron voting power.},

The establishment and continuous management of these cooperatives were greatly assisted by the two major Jewish philanthropic organizations of the period, the Jewish Colonization Association (JCA) and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC). These organizations acted as charitable institutions but also as third-sector organizations which aspired both to assist and to socially engineer East European Jewish society. In British Mandate Palestine a Zionist branch of the movement was established, which was, however, free from the influences of these philanthropic organizations. The article describes and analyzes this little-researched phenomenon while seeking to place it within the theoretical frameworks of philanthropy and transnationalism. It concludes with an observational comparison between the political context in which Jewish credit cooperatives were created, namely East European ethnic regimes, and the Israeli ethnic democracy.},

Descriptive statistics, factor analysis and intercorellations were employed in analysing the data.

In addition, perceptions related to the development and growth prospects of the co-operative and to work-family balance have also been positively affected. Practical implications - The effectiveness of an entrepreneurship program can be enhanced when it is designed to meet the real needs of the organization and thus is more focused.

	abstract = {The study focuses on evaluating factors that farmers consider relevant in adopting cassava production in five semi-arid zone of West African countries. The study is based on primary data randomly collected as part of collaborative study of cassava in semiarid zones of Africa (COSCASSA) village level survey from five West African countries namely: Nigeria, Ghana, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso. This study models effects of farm, farmer and technology specific factors on the decision of semi arid farmers to adopt cassava into their farming system. By way of threshold decision models-Probit and Logit models, the estimation of each country and the pooled data adoption models reveal different adoption models for the countries considered. For each country, different variables appeared as major adoption shifters. Comparatively, the adoption models for Nigeria and whole region appear to have the highest significance variables, being seven in number. This is followed by Chad (6), Ghana (4), and Burkina Faso and Niger with three each. For the variables considered, distance to nearby urban market appears a major adoption shifter in all the country, except for Niger. This is closely followed by contact with extension, variety, pest/disease resistance and livestock feeds, which appear significant in four of the countries. Membership of cooperative societies appears as the least adoption predictor, which is only significant in Chad republic. The study therefore recognizes the importance of varietial characteristics and farmers' characteristics in acceptance of cassava as a major root tuber crop in the semi arid region of West Africa. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Three categories of member attributes are identified: satisfaction with the profitability of farm operations, age of the member, and experience from board work. The cooperatives' degree of success is measured as members' commitment towards cooperatives, and members' trust in the board of directors. The data originate from a mail survey among 2,250 Swedish farmers. The results indicate differences in members' commitment and their trust towards directors to be due to farm profitability, the members' age and experience as directors. After adding members' perception of their participation in the governance as a covariate, most of the other differences are explained by this variable. Age is still partly associated with trust towards directors; older farmers have less trust. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Their efforts to identify these opportunities and commercially exploit them can be greatly enhanced by subordinates that constructively collaborate with their coworkers to actively seek information that leads to opportunity recognition and exploitation. This study assesses the effect of the Need for Closure (NFC) on the degree credit union managers rely on their own experiences and coworkers of equal hierarchical rank in interpreting common workplace events. The patterns of behavior they exhibited in interpreting and acting on these events should also be reflective of how these individuals would pursue entrepreneurial activities. Respondents were classified into two equal size groups based on their NFC (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994; Kruglanski, Webster & Klem, 1993) scale scores. The high and low NFC group's scores on the Event Management Questionnaire (Smith, Peterson & Schwartz, 2002) were then compared as to the effect their own experiences and coworkers of equal hierarchical rank had on managing workplace events. The results supported the hypothesis that NFC would be negatively related to the reliance on coworkers, but did not support the hypothesis that NFC would be positively related to reliance on the managers' prior experience. Post Hoc analysis revealed that the relationship between NFC and reliance on coworkers was only significant in the case of female respondents.},

An analysis of secondary data indicates that neither political nor economic conditions inhibit the development of cooperatives. Therefore, the focus is directed towards the socio-psychological factors. The aim of the study is to empirically explore the extent to which socio-psychological factors explain the difficulties for agricultural cooperative development within the Kurgan region of the Russian Federation. Based on literature concerning cooperative members' attitudes, values, commitment and similar variables, four hypotheses are suggested. These are tested empirically on the basis of data from a total of 927 agricultural producers, both members and nonmembers of existing cooperatives. The findings reveal that especially the level of trust in others is crucial. Furthermore, the involvement is low among nonmembers, their attitudes to cooperatives are poor, and their belief and experience in democratic governance are weak.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to argue that the legacy of instrumental rationality has had a profoundly impoverishing effect on rational accounts of organisation, and that even though non-rational accounts move beyond instrumental rationality, they remain tied to economist assumptions. The paper outlines the broader Weber and Habermas's model of rationality, and demonstrates its application. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on verbatim quotes from a sampling of 35 in-depth interviews, the paper reveals the range of very different rationalities expressed in the social relations of work, of four very specific types of organisation: a bureaucracy, an entrepreneurial unit, a producer co-operative and a worker co-operative. Findings – The paper outlines two ideal sets of findings, ideal in the sense that in two of the organisations the rationalities, social relations of work and associated outcomes fit well with the Weber and Habermas model of instrumental strategic action and social strategic action. Research limitations/implications – This study shows the potential for broader rationality as it plays out in the workplace. The notion of workplaces that free workers to contribute in socially strategic ways points to new approaches to management and organisation. Practical implications – The paper offers practical insights into social relations built on co-operation, moral judgement and communication. Originality/value – The power of the idea of broader rationality is that being more rational, i.e. attending to more than a narrow impoverished view, provides the prospect of action advancing the social and the economic in a profound way. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

This research note reports on discrepancies found between CEO and director perceptions of board involvement in the strategic management of credit unions. Consensus scores measure the dispersion of opinion, and the scores are compared to outcome measures using stepwise TOBIT analysis, which is rarely used in management research but is appropriate for studies with clustering of dependent variables. Findings reveal that the level of agreement about the board's involvement in mission statement development is associated with board member satisfaction. However, increases in the level of agreement about the board's involvement in monitoring strategy implementation are found in organizations that have less favorable financial soundness ratings. © 2008 Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action.},

It examines the comparative institutional and policy characteristics of Authorized Neighborhood Associations and two other types of forest ownership, and presents findings based on case studies undertaken in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. The study reveals that hamlets are establishing Authorized Neighborhood Associations to acquire formal collective ownership of Iriai forests, adapt to present socioeconomic realities, and reduce bureaucratic transaction costs. Authorized Neighborhood Associations are clearly emerging as an attractive alternative to other formal and informal grass-roots forestry institutions.},

	abstract = {There is ample evidence to suggest that improving the on-farm productivity of small-scale farmers and integrating them into commercial markets is a promising strategy for alleviating poverty and leveraging agriculture as an engine of wider economic growth. Yet, persistent market failures in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa have limited the impact of this strategy. As a result, there is increasing interest in the study of state and community failures - the underlying rural governance issues - that affect small-scale farmers. This paper contributes to this area of inquiry by examining the role of farmers' cooperatives in local governance systems in Ethiopia. By drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data sources, the paper offers new insights into the potential role of rural governance systems in national development strategies, the interactions between formal and informal rural governance systems, and possible avenues through which farmers' cooperatives can contribute to improving rural governance and national development.

	abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to assess in quantitative terms farmers' perceptions of sustainable agriculture and to determine how those are influenced by different socio-economic characteristics and information-seeking behavior of the farmers. The study was conducted in Kahramanmaras province of Turkey and comprised a stratified sample of 208 farmers from four districts of the province. The farmers rated each of the 21 selected sustainable agricultural practices for importance on a 5-point scale, and the total of these ratings formed the sustainable agriculture perception index. The index score was calculated for each farmer and was treated as the dependent variable in the stepwise regression analysis procedure. The independent variables were such socio-economic characteristics as the farming system, the total and irrigated area of the farm, membership of a cooperative society and participation in village administration, and age, education, and income of the farmer; components of information-seeking behavior included use of the mass media (newspapers, radio, and television), use of the Internet, travel, and participation in farming events. The results of the study showed that the higher the socio-economic status (more frequent contact with extension services, higher education, ownership of land, etc.) and the greater the access to information, the greater the perceived importance of sustainable agricultural practices. It is concluded that if policy-makers and extension organizations concentrate on these factors, they are more likely to succeed in making farmers more favorably disposed toward sustainable agriculture. © Springer Science + Business Media, B.V. 2008.},

	abstract = {Organizational skills of farmers in Kambala were improved to address financing of the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBD). Dipping exercises were conducted bi-weekly. Individual animals were dipped fortnightly at a fee and a fund was established from which a cooperative society was formed. To monitor TTBD lymph nodes and blood samples were analysed (n = 1615 calves, ages 1 - 10 weeks). Theileria piroplasms were observed in 9.8% and 16.2% of calves of < 42 days and > 42 days, respectively. Lymph nodes of calves < 6 weeks were not enlarged while enlargement rates in 43-56, 57-69 and > 70 days old calves were 41.5%, 40.3%, 34.9%, respectively. Packed cell volumes, haemoglobin concentration, red and white blood cell counts were low in all calves. After four years of continuous dipping analysis indicated a net benefit of US $ 116,278.60 and that the endemic stability model reduced amount of acaricides used. Calving rates increased from <40% to >75%, disease incidence rates declined, calf mortalities decreased from >41.5% to < 2% and calf survival rates increased from 58% to 98%. It was concluded that the Kambala model reduces costs and offers a community based approach to fund TTBD control.},

Agricultural cooperatives have long played an important role in helping their members manage risk. However, agricultural cooperatives seem not to be particularly good at helping their members to manage production risk, which involves variation in yield over the course of several years. Agricultural producers face various sorts of risk some of which are difficult to manage using standard institutions. The cooperative must deploy a different mechanism if it is to help members manage shocks to output. Inducing members to commit to deliver their entire production to the cooperative would require that shares in the cooperative be allocated in rough proportion to members' expected production. Agricultural cooperatives could perfectly share yield risk among their members by pooling total revenues from all their members and then distributing these revenues in proportion to members' shares.},

	abstract = {The production planning is one of the key managerial decisions in agricultural business, which must be done periodically every year. Correct decision must cover the agriculture demands of planting the crops such as crop rotation restrictions or water resource scarcity, while the decision maker aims to plan the crop design in most profitable way in sense of maximizing the total profit from the crop yield. This decision problem represents the optimization of crop design and can be treated by the methods of linear programming which begun to be extensively used in agriculture production planning in USA during 50's. There is ongoing research of mathematical programming applications in agriculture worldwide, but the results are not easily transferable to other localities due to the specific local restrictions in each country. In Czech Republic the farmers use for production planning mainly their expert knowledge and past experience. However, the mathematical programming approach enables find the true optimal solution of the problem, which especially in the problems with a great number of constraints is not easy to find intuitively. One of the possible barriers for using the general decision support systems (which are based on mathematical programming methods) for agriculture production planning in Czech Republic is its expensiveness. The small farmer can not afford to buy the expensive software or to employ a mathematical programming specialist. The aim of this paper is to present a user friendly linear programming model of the typical agricultural production planning problem in Czech Republic which can be solved via software tools commonly available in any farm (e.g. EXCEL). The linear programming model covering the restrictions on total costs, crop rotation, thresholds for the total area sowed by particular crops, total amount of manure and the need of feed crops is developed. The model is applied in real-world problem of Czech agriculture cooperative and the results of its solution are compared to the real decision made. The applicability of the model in every day agriculture managerial practice in Czech Republic is discussed and its possible enlargement is mentioned.},

	abstract = {Capital management by mutual financial institutions (such as credit unions) provides a valuable testing ground for assessing the impact of capital regulation and theories of managerial behaviour in financial institutions. Limited access to external equity capital means that capital accumulation must be met primarily by reliance on retained earnings. To deal with shocks to the capital position and avoid breaching regulatory requirements, managers will aim to have a buffer of capital in excess of the regulatory minimum. Moreover, mutual governance arrangements and an absence of capital market discipline mean that managers have discretion to set target capital ratios which differ significantly from industry averages. This paper develops a formal model of capital management and risk management in mutual financial institutions such as credit unions which reflects these industry characteristics. The model is tested using data from larger credit unions in Australia, which have been subject to the Basel Accord Risk Weighted Capital Requirements since 1993. The data supports the hypothesis that credit unions manage their capital position by setting a short term target profit rate (return on assets) which is positively related to asset growth and which is aimed at gradually removing discrepancies between the actual and desired capital ratio. Desired capital ratios vary significantly across credit unions. There is little evidence of short run adjustments to the risk of the asset portfolio to achieve a desired capital position. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {For 2 decades, calls for Australian rangeland landholders to expand their reliance on the abundant species of native kangaroos and decrease their reliance on introduced stock have been made. These calls have received recent impetus from the challenge of climate change. Arguments for landholder involvement in kangaroo production include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, better management of total grazing pressure, reduced land degradation, improved vegetation and biodiversity outcomes, and greater valuation of kangaroos by landholders. However, there is little understanding of how landholders could be involved in kangaroo harvest and production, and there is a widespread misconception that this would include domestication, fencing, mustering and trucking. This paper reviews the options for landholder involvement in managing and harvesting wild kangaroos, and assesses the possible benefits and feasibility of such options. We conclude that collaboration among landholders, as well as between landholders and harvesters, forms the basis of any preferred option, and set out a proposed operating model based on the formation of a kangaroo management, processing and marketing co-operative. © 2009 Australian Rangeland Society.},

However, whereas there are practical applications implemented in banks, there are rarely empirical studies about this legal form of banking system. Nowadays, the financial crisis is affecting the development of certain industries and territories. Credit unions, as singular financial organizations, have intangible elements with peculiar characteristics. These characteristics must be studied to manage their competitive advantages and provide management with relevant information for decision making. Through the Delphi analysis, this article will identify the singularities of human capital in these entities. The singularities of the credit union sector show that human resources are potentially more determined to adopt a strong corporate culture and invest more in training. On the other hand, main deficits of credit unions will be their aptitudes and lesser capacities, academic level or low investment in training.},

Design/methodology/approach - This paper employs a data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework using four kinds of performance indices selection, which include basic input/output items, balance scorecard (BSC) indices, balanced scorecard with risk management, and traditional financial indices, to evaluate banking operations. Findings - Shows that a DEA-based evaluation of performance produces a similar view of the firm's well-being as does an analysis of financial indices; however, a BSC-based evaluation produces a different assessment. Research limitations/implications - This study was based on the following assumptions: first, when organizational units achieve technical efficiency, they will improve their organizational performance. Secondly, the inputs and outputs selected for the data envelopment analysis provided an indicator of the changes of bank's technical efficiency over the six-year period. Practical implications - This research was based on the data envelopment analysis approach to find different performance efficiency to apply four performance indicator selections, which include basic inputs/outputs items, balanced scorecard indices, balanced scorecard with risk management, and traditional financial indices, to evaluate bank operation. Originality/value - Combines the balanced scorecard concept with data envelopment analysis measurements (model information) to generate measures of technical efficiency for a Taiwanese bank. It shows how comparisons can be made within and across companies on the basis of balanced scorecard measures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Management of the assets and liabilities of credit unions is similar to other financial institutions because similar financial risks need to be balanced while meeting their first and foremost objective -- maximization of their shareholder's wealth. However, the risks are somewhat different because of the size, geographic concentration, liquidity needs and extension of credit only to its members. Geographic concentration limits the need for evaluation relative to the financial strengths and ability to assess and adequately monitor the risks of the investments. A small size credit union may manage risks by investing all of the surplus funds in a corporate credit union instead of investing in securities. However, the growth of credit union's assets and liabilities poses challenges for management in understanding risks and returns. Credit union management often uses a laddered portfolio as a tool to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. In this approach, investment maturities are laddered to provide necessary cash flows. This paper presents how fuzzy goal programming techniques can be efficiently applied in developing sophisticated investment decision making models to provide feasible solutions for credit union portfolio management problems for constructing efficient portfolios. We have formulated additive and weighted additive models for investment decisions using fuzzy goal programming. The results are tested based on scenario analysis for the data selected for the study. Additionally, comparison of the results from both models related to achievements of targeted goals and preferences is also presented. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.},

They propose an economic modeling framework based on vertical product differentiation and utilize it to study cooperatives' pooling practices. They consider a market where farmers produce a vertically-differentiated commodity which can either be high-quality (H) or low-quality (L), where consumers always prefer H over L. Farmers are assumed initially to be homogeneous in their ability to produce H product. Tina and Richard then consider optimal cooperative pooling in a market where farmers can exit the cooperative in favor of a competitive marketing arrangement. All marketing firms operate with zero marginal cost. They demonstrate that traditional revenue pooling can confer two strategic advantages in a quality-differentiated market. Firstly pooling attenuates the incentive of competitive farmers to overproduce high-quality product and secondly, it insures risk-averse farmers against adverse realizations of quality.},

	abstract = {Nested analysis of variance is used to identify the sources of variation in performance, measured by growth of membership and growth of assets, for a large sample of US credit unions. The analysis reveals that sector effects (geographic, common bond and charter type) account for only relatively small proportions of the variation in performance. This raises doubts as to whether credit unions are likely to benefit much from competitive repositioning at sector level (by changing their charter type or common bond designation). It may be that the perceived benefit derived from such manoeuvrings is greater than the actual benefit, or it may be that the large number of credit unions seeking a more permissive operating environment has ended up negating any potential gain in performance across the sector as a whole. In contrast to the limited role identified for sector effects, individual credit union effects explain a large proportion of the variation in performance. This suggests that decisions made by individual credit unions with respect to staffing, governance and product portfolio, as well as philosophy and ethos, play an important role in explaining the heterogeneity in credit union performance.},

The general trend of the efficiency estimates shows an improving cost-efficiency accompanied by a fairly stable but declining profit-efficiency of the CCUs. Specifically, the result shows that only about 2% of costs are wasted, on average, relative to a best-practice firm facing the same conditions. Meanwhile, the mean profit estimates for the 14-year period is 92%. Credit cooperatives with a greater number of women employees are more cost- and profit-efficient. However, the dominance of women as members incurs more cost and thus less profit. This raises the issue of having MFIs targeting only women as well as the concern for higher monitoring costs for them, which imply higher total costs and less profits. © Canadian Association for the Study of International Development, 2009.},

The number of farming families has decreased by 46% between 1971 and 2006 (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006, Customised Data), therefore the re-evaluation of farming methods seems appropriate. Traditional family farming, co-operative and corporate farming, as well as cross-boundary farming is discussed. The latter is a form of collective farming: it means individual title, but collective ownership and management. These issues will be examined through a literature review and commentary. This system has worked well for many years in Europe (ABC Landline, 2001). In Australia, a group of academics and landholders worked this system successfully for six years; it was called common property resources system (Williamson, Brunckhorst and Kelly, 2003). It encouraged flexibility and shared labour, and there was economic, ecological and environmental success. Why was the system abandoned? Rural communities depend upon the sustainability of the surrounding land and farms, but the persisting drought and degradation of the land has led to a decline in the social and economic viability of life in rural areas. Sustainability requires a re-thinking of the landscape, which, in turn, requires a re-thinking of eco-ethical values and biodiversity, as well as having a holistic approach.

	abstract = {This study was conducted to compare three models: two random regression models with and without considering heterogeneity in the residual variances and a lactation model (LM) for evaluating the genetic ability of Holstein cows in Korea. Two datasets were prepared for this study. To apply the test-day random regression model, 94,390 test-day records were prepared from 15,263 cows. The second data set consisted of 14,704 lactation records covering milk production over 305 days. Raw milk yield and composition data were collected from 1998 to 2002 by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation's dairy cattle improvement center by way of its milk testing program, which is nationally based. The pedigree information for this analysis was collected by the Korean Animal Improvement Association. The random regression models (RRMs) are single-trait animal models that consider each lactation record as an independent trait. Estimates of covariance were assumed to be different ones. In order to consider heterogeneity of residual variance in the analysis, test-days were classified into 29 classes. By considering heterogeneity of residual variance, variation for lactation performance in the early lactation classes was higher than during the middle classes and variance was lower in the late lactation classes than in the other two classes. This may be due to feeding management system and physiological properties of Holstein cows in Korea. Over classes e6 to e26 (covering 61 to 270 DIM), there was little change in residual variance, suggesting that a model with homogeneity of variance be used restricting the data to these days only. Estimates of heritability for milk yield ranged from 0.154 to 0.455, for which the estimates were variable depending on different lactation periods. Most of the heritabilities for milk yield using the RRM were higher than in the lactation model, and the estimate of genetic variance of milk yield was lower in the late lactation period than in the early or middle periods.},

This article explores the question of self-discipline by drawing on empirical material from a longitudinal study of the Irish credit union movement. As financial co-operatives, credit unions have a tradition of helping local communities under the aegis of mutuality and co-operative credit. The article theorizes two interrelated, yet antagonistic discourses within the credit union movement; an older community service discourse and an emerging enterprise discourse. In tracing the question of what it means to be a credit union volunteer, the article explores some of the tensions and contradictions between the two discourses, as experienced by volunteers who struggle with the question of how to balance the movement's traditional self-help ethos with the growing pressures to become more entrepreneurial.

The model followed is an input oriented approach related to undesirable output (environmental performance attribute) in horticultural marketing cooperatives. This study is motivated by both the lack of analysis of environmental performance's effects on agribusiness productivity and the relevance of cooperative firms in the European agricultural model for attaining sustainability. For this purpose, bootstrapped envelopment analysis is applied and the best practice frontier obtained corresponds to decision making units showing the best environmental behaviour. The Malmquist total factor productivity (TFP) is decomposed into technological change, efficiency and environmental change. In the second stage, the correlations of these changes with other management variables of cooperatives are analysed. The indicators obtained, on one hand, advice about the nonseparable distance function estimations when the environmental factor is introduced. On the other hand, the results display a relevant increase in efficiency and environmental components for the period under study showing a high influence from labour qualification, environmental effort and spillover effect in the sector.},

The cooperative's revenues depend on the production of the farmers and also on the actions of the CEO, which fall under the same categories. The contracts must ensure that a majority of the farmers are willing to enforce their terms as the members control the decisions. Farmers can leave the cooperative, which implies that they can spend resources improving their outside opportunities or participating in the management of the cooperative.},

Design/methodology/approach - Through a case study of a workers' co-operative named Cofudeco, supplying a farm named Hacienda Gavilanes, the paper shows that co-operative members see the farm's business as their opportunity to provide a better living for their families. Findings - The paper reveals that the farm today enjoys enviable security conditions guarded by the loyalty of the co-operative members. The farm owner no longer pays daily wages to the workers but negotiates on compensation for the completion of certain tasks. Practical implications - The paper contends that, if adopted on a larger scale, such human-resource practices could transform the business environment in hostile zones in Colombia and even help to improve the country's investment climate. Originality/value - The paper describes how the system creates incentives for time-saving innovations, and workers have come up with several proposals for improving the processes.

Offshore wind power, however, is not just technologically challenging but also a capital intensive and risky business that requires particular financial and organizational resources not all potential investors might have. We therefore address the question, what impact offshore wind power may have on ownership and organizational structures in the wind power sector. We compare on- and offshore wind park ownership in Denmark, the UK and Germany. The analysis shows that offshore wind power in all three countries is dominated by large firms, many of which are from the electricity sector. In Denmark and the UK, also investors from the gas and oil industry play an important role in the offshore wind business. This development represents a major shift for countries such as Germany and Denmark, in which the wind power sector has grown and matured on the basis of investments by individuals, farmers, cooperatives and independent project developers. The structural changes by which offshore wind power is accompanied have consequences for turbine manufacturers, project developers, investors, associations and policy makers in the field. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and market poultry, one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa's new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equitysharing partnerships.},

Two successful cooperatives in the same town, one old and one new, have been compared with respect to their social capital, development and leadership. The findings show that, in the traditional agricultural cooperative, a more social oriented leadership has helped to overcome economic, social, and psychological barriers arising during transition, while, in the case of the new co-op, improving cooperation has depended mainly on the increased level of social capital after the radical reforms.},

In addition, we find that membership in coffee-marketing cooperatives, farm size, and certain soil types are associated with tree cover, while proximity to small town centers is associated with clearing. © 2008 American Agricultural Economics Association.},

Cooperatives are a unique business structure that might not have profit maximization as a goal. Thus measures of performance other than return on equity are used to establish the link. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses regression to explain the relationship between board characteristics and performance. Findings – The results of the models of return on assets and equity indicated that board size and compensation explain little of the variability in performance in these profitability measures. The results of the models of operating efficiencies explained a greater proportion of the variability in the operating efficiency and operating expenses-to-average assets ratios. In both models the relationship exhibited diminishing returns to board size and per member compensation. Research limitations/implications – The data are based on just one year of performance, limiting the generalizability of the results. Practical implications – The paper includes implications for the size of boards of directors and director compensation.

However, the resources and competencies required to implement such an integrated strategy at the level of the individual, the organization, and the sector are not known. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed an approach to analyze responses of organizations to environmental change and evolving social demands for biodiversity conservation. We analyze the scale, scope, and distribution of the resources and competencies that support the delineation of ecologically significant habitats in intensively managed nonindustrial private forests in Finland, an important international actor in the sector. Based on a national survey of 311 foresters working in public agencies, private firms, and cooperative organizations, we investigate the division of labor in the sector and the patterns of investment in human capital, organizational resources, and information networks that support delineation. We find that communicating frequently with the actors who are directly engaged in field operations is consistently the most productive resource in conserving habitats. Our analysis identifies differences in competencies among different types of organizations, as well as distinct roles for public and private-sector organizations. Beyond identification of differences in conservation behavior and competencies among organizations, our analysis points to substantial uniformity in the sector. We attribute similarities in patterns of investment in conservation resources to historically structured central coordination mechanisms within the sector that include education, training, and broadly shared professional norms. These institutional structures and the resulting uniformity can be potential impediments to radical innovation. Our approach to analyzing adaptation to environmental change highlights the interplay between investments in competencies by actors within a particular technical domain and the evolving external institutional environment. © 2009 by the author(s).},

We nest a cross-sectional time-series panel model within the risk-adjusted earnings principles of Ohlson (1995), and apply the model to a dataset of NSW credit unions during a period of regulatory intervention that abruptly required management to meet minimum capital thresholds. Because they cannot issue equity, and other income increasing options conflicted with credit union philosophy, this provided a strong incentive to use MCE as an option to rapidly increase revenue (and capital). We find MCE was financially ineffective in small credit unions, had a positive marketing leverage impact in large credit unions, and required regular renewal. Our study makes several contributions by: (i) disaggregating and testing the financial impact of marketing; (ii) applying a risk-adjusted model generally applicable to non-listed firms; (iii) informing on the capitalisation/expensing debate; (iv) highlighting when and why MCE as a real option is financially (in)effective; and, (v) adding to the growing interface in the financial/marketing literature. © 2008, SAGE Publications.

	abstract = {Credit unions are financial co-operatives that conduct their business for their members. The principal purpose of a credit union is to receive deposits from and make loans to members. They do not serve the general public. Membership is restricted by a qualification that is referred to as a common bond or field of membership. The origins of credit unions are to be found at the heart of the Industrial Revolution, when Robert Owen established two famous co-operatives in Rochdale and New Lanark. The most prominent co-operative influenced by his ideas, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, opened their famous co-operative shop on Toad Lane in 1844. This was an important step in the social and political change that was taking place throughout Europe and of which the people of Rochdale can justifiably claim to be leaders. By 1848, the Co-operative had 140 members and the society's membership increased to 390, by 1880 the national membership of consumer societies had reached over 500 000, and by the turn of the century it had reached 1.5 million. The members of the two co-operatives subscribed to shares and paid small amounts to raise sufficient funds in order to purchase goods below the market value and then resell them to the members at a savings. These co-operatives were the result of the growing complexities of modern economic life for both farmers and workers. Importantly, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers developed a number of principles that have assisted the development of credit unions. These principles were open membership, the democratic control of the organisation, a limited interest on share capital and the return on member's interests being in proportion to the member's patronage. These principles illustrate why credit unions are a unique financial co-operative. Under the guidance of the World Council of Credit Unions, the growth of credit unions has been remarkable. In 2007, there were 49 000 credit unions and 177 000 000 members in 96 countries. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it aims to illustrate how credit unions are able to grow in times of economic hardship- a situation that is demonstrated by examining the impact of the Great Depression in the United States of America (USA) and the Credit Crunch in the United Kingdom (UK). Second, the article highlights the importance of deposit protection schemes when credit unions face financial difficulties in the USA, UK and the Republic of Ireland (Ireland). © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

Formal hypotheses are tested on a sample of 157 agricultural cooperatives involved in channel partnership with larger, downstream second-order marketing cooperatives. The results indicate that the target's trust in the source enhances the positive effects of both types of controls. However, the target's dependence on the source decreases the positive effects of behaviour-based controls on the target's performance. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Food processing businesses run by agriculture cooperatives (in this paper referred to as food processing cooperatives) are basically firms that are owned by the suppliers of raw materials. Typically, in this type of firm, corporate decision-making is the responsibility of member farmers through the one member one - vote rule, and the surplus of the business is divided among them according to the amount of raw agricultural products they have supplied to the firm. This is in contrast to a conventional capitalistic firm, in which corporate decision-making is ultimately made by the stockholders through the one share - one vote rule, and the profit is divided among them according to the amount of financial capital they have supplied to the firm.

	abstract = {Purpose - In recent years, the focus of the Chinese Government has deviated from economic growth to overall societal balance and harmony. One of the major policy adjustments is to strengthen the supply of public goods in rural areas and set up the rural cooperative medical system (RCMS) financed by both governments and farmers. The purpose of this paper is to outline the background, recent developments, achievements and problems of the RCMS and help people to understand the RCMS in China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a time approach, meaning the paper is organized by initiate background, system framework design, experiment and extension, achievement, problems and discussion about the RCMS development process. Findings - The Central Government intended to establish a new medical system in rural areas, so that farmers could protect themselves if they got sick. The paper finds that, with the help of the government, farmers have gradually accepted the medical cooperation system. The RCMS has rapidly been extended, and forms a basic medical security net for rural residents. The RCMS has achieved the initial goals of the policy reform: mitigating farmers' financial burden, increasing the number of visits to doctors, and reducing the cost of the RCMS. However, there are still some pending issues such as fund-raising, monitoring-efficiency, and medical targets that need to be solved. Originality/value - This paper is a general review, which provides a brief and general image of the Chinese RCMS and helps people to understand the RCMS in China. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Facing this situation, from the end of the nineteenth century they promoted important efforts for social mobilisation and tried to obtain control of the peasantry through agrarian cooperatives and other associations. Nevertheless, as a consequence of the increasing struggle with the peasantry, landowners changed their strategy, and in the 1930s concentrated their collective action on the defence of property.

Actually, some theorists have clarified that self-management should reverse the customary cap ital-labour relation, in terms that all such business activities as are traditionally run by capitalists should instead be run by workers, but this bare statement does not convey the exhaustive information required for a full comprehension of the institutional background against which their theoretical approaches are being developed. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to illustrate an organisation mode that might ensure the efficient running of self-managed firms. The author offers arguments in support of his contention that well-organised cooperative firms do not come in for most of the criticisms levelled against them in today's economic literature. Lastly, the paper criticises a well-known opinion by Jensen and Meckling.},

An adequate supply of wholesome water is the foundation of health for any community. Today due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, the water bodies are being increasingly contaminated by various toxic pollutants. The processes in a textile mill require large volumes of water all of which are released later as effluent. One major group of contaminants in this effluent is dyestuffs which makes it aesthetically unacceptable and also toxic depending on the chemicals. The present study has been undertaken to assess the impact of effluents released by the APOL (Assam Polyester Co-operative Society Limited), textile mill Rangia in the district of Kamrup, Assam on the quality of drinking water in the neighbouring areas. The mill, established in an area of 38.02 acre of prime agricultural land, started functioning frorn November 1988. The effluent of the mill is discharged into the agricultural land on the western side of the mill. There is a historical earthen dam from the boundary wall of the mill along western direction at a distance of about 125 m. This dam divides the area into two parts, one between the mill and the dam and the other between the dam and the surroundings. Water samples from drinking water sources used by the households in the surroundings of the mill are taken up for monitoring and analysis in this work. Surface water samples from the nearby agricultural land are also collected and analysed. Concentrations of cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K), anions (CI, N03, S0 4, P04, F) and heavy metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) reveal that effluent discharge from the mill is having some impact on the quality of drinking water and surface water of the locality. © 2009-Kalpana Corporation.},

Community banks were created to: (1) promote rural development through provision of banking and financial services, (2) enhance rural productive activities, and (3) improve economic status of small-scale producers in rural and urban areas. According to Marx (2004), Nigeria has a dynamic informal financial sector. A key to growth strategy is to assist the development of this informal sector. The recent government policy to rid the economy of community banks defeats the original purpose underlying the creation of community banks. In view of the important role of community banks in Nigeria, the authors propose that community banks should continue to be rural financial institutions with specialized methods to serve broad segments of the rural population. The National Board for Community Banks should be vested with power to license, monitor and regulate community banks, and the regulatory power of the Central Bank of Nigeria over community banks should not go beyond that necessary for the performance of its monetary policy function. Furthermore, a partnership should be formed between the National Board for Community Banks, National Association of Community Banks and the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank for the purpose of funding rural ventures through loan syndication. The Bankers' Committee initiative for small and medium enterprises funding should be channeled through the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to detect significant SNPs for carcass quality traits using DNA chips of high SNP density in Hanwoo populations. Carcass data of two hundred and eighty nine steers sired by 30 Korean proven sires were collected from two regions; the Hanwoo Improvement Center of National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in Seosan, Chungnam province and the commercial farms in Gyeongbuk province. The steers in Seosan were born between spring and fall of 2006 and those in Gyeonbuk between falls of 2004 and 2005. The former steers were slaughtered at approximately 24 months, while the latter steers were fed six months longer before slaughter. Among the 55,074 SNPs in the Illumina bovine 50K chip, a total of 32,756 available SNPs were selected for whole genome association study. After adjusting for the effects of sire, region and slaughter age, phenotypes were regressed on each SNP using a simple linear regression model. For the significance threshold, 0.1% point-wise p value from F distribution was used for each SNP test. Among the significant SNPs for a trait, the best set of SNP markers were selected using a stepwise regression procedure, and inclusion and exclusion of each SNP out of the model was determined at the p<0.001 level. A total of 118 SNPs were detected; 15, 20, 22, 28, 20, and 13 SNPs for final weight before slaughter, carcass weight, backfat thickness, weight index, longissimus dorsi muscle area, and marbling score, respectively. Among the significant SNPs, the best set of 44 SNPs was determined by stepwise regression procedures with 7, 9, 6, 9, 7, and 6 SNPs for the respective traits. Each set of SNPs per trait explained 20-40% of phenotypic variance. The number of detected SNPs per trait was not great in whole genome association tests, suggesting additional phenotype and genotype data are required to get more power to detect the trait-related SNPs with high accuracy for estimation of the SNP effect. These SNP markers could be applied to commercial Hanwoo populations via marker-assisted selection to verify the SNP effects and to improve genetic potentials in successive generations of the Hanwoo populations.},

	abstract = {Municipal solid waste management (SWM) problems present a serious challenge to local government authorities (LGAs) in developing countries. The effective way to reduce this tremendous issue is to integreate waste recycling systems into existing and future SWM. Understanding factors influencing recycling performance is the key to achieving sustainable waste management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the performance of SWM relating to solid waste recycling covering a total of 120 solid waste recycling programs located in different urban areas of Thailand. The indicators involving efficiency, effectiveness and service ratio were used for the assessment of recycling performance using statistical analysis methods. Influencing factors encompassing technical, economic and financial, and institutional aspects were identified for three types of recycling programs (school garbage bank, community garbage bank, and composting facility). The results suggest that common significant factors are perception of administrator awareness of SWM problems, and source separation. In terms of school garbage banks, the provision of monetary incentive including interest and compensatory goods for recycling members, transportation cost, and low investment costs significantly affect the performance. Provision of loans, managing the program as a cooperative organization, and provision of door-to-door service correlate with better performance by community garbage banks. For composting facilities, provision of free organic waste bins and cooperation with NGOs correlate with a higher rate of waste diversion. The findings also propose implications for enhancing the performance of recycling systems through a number of measures including provision of monetary incentive, tax incentives, subsidizations, information dissemination, awareness campaigns, training, technical assistance, staff exchanges, and networking with voluntary organizations-which should be formulated with respect to building capacity of development partners, responding to poor recycling performance, and focusing on significant influencing factors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {1. In cooperative societies with high reproductive skew, selection on females is likely to operate principally through variation in the probability of acquiring dominant status and variation in reproductive success while dominant. Despite this, few studies of cooperative societies have investigated the factors that influence which females become dominant, and/or their reproductive output while in the dominant position. 2. Here we use long-term data from a wild meerkat population to describe variation in the breeding success of dominant female meerkats Suricata suricatta and investigate its causes. 3. Female meerkats compete intensely for breeding positions, and the probability of acquiring the breeding role depends upon a female's age in relation to competitors and her weight, both at the time of dominance acquisition and early in life. 4. Once dominant, individual differences in breeding success depend principally on the duration of dominance tenure. Females remain for longer in the dominant position if they are heavier than their competitors at the start of dominance, and if the number of adult female competitors at the start is low. 5. Female breeding success is also affected by variation in fecundity and pup survival, both of which increase with group size. After controlling for these effects, female body weight has a positive influence on breeding rate and litter size, while the number of adult female competitors reduces litter survival. 6. These findings suggest that selection for body weight and competitive ability will be high in female meerkats, which may moderate their investment in cooperative activities. We suggest that similar consequences of competition may occur among females in other cooperative societies where the benefits of attaining dominance status are high. © 2007 The Authors.},

To research farmers' demand for rural financial services a representative household survey was conducted early 2008 in the region of Shida Kartli (N=406). The survey included a choice experiment to investigate farmer's preferences for characteristics of particular credit schemes. Results show that segments of the farmer population differ in their preferences for loan attributes. Furthermore, farmers expressed a very high demand for small credits with individual liability, and one third of them have experience with loans. These findings provide useful information for future credit cooperatives. Barriers to implementation are lack of trust among farmers and misconception of cooperatives with the former Soviet kolkhozes. Information campaigns can therefore be a key ingredient for the successful establishment of credit cooperatives.},

	abstract = {Approaches to manage for the sustainable use of natural and cultural resources in a landscape can have many different designs. One design is adaptive collaborative landscape management (ACLM) where research providers and users work closely together on projects to develop resources while adaptively managing to sustain or maintain landscapes in the long term. We propose that collaborative projects are more useful for achieving outcomes than integrative projects where participants merely join their separate contributions. To foster collaborative research projects to adaptively manage landscapes in northern Australia, a Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre (TSCRC) was established in 1995. The TSCRC is a joint venture of major organizations involved in research and land management. This paper is our perspective on the four most important 'lessons learned' after using a ACLM-type approach for over 10 y. We learnt that collaboration (working in combination) not necessarily integration (combining parts into a whole) achieved sustainable outcomes. We found that integration across culturally diverse perspectives seldom achieved sustainable solutions because it devalued the position of the less empowered participants. In addition, positive outcomes were achieved when participants developed trust and respect for each other by embracing and respecting their differences and by sharing unifying concepts such as savanna health. Another lesson learned was that a collaborative organization must act as an honest broker by resisting advocacy of one view point over another. Finally, we recognized the importance of strongly investing in communication and networking so that people could adaptively learn from one another's experiences, understand each other's challenges and respect each other's choices. Our experience confirms the usefulness of the ACLM approach and highlights its role in the process of sustaining healthy landscapes. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

Also, an assessment is made of what the future may hold for the direction of the UK credit union sector. Findings – The paper finds that credit union membership is growing, as are members’ deposits and loans, however at the same time the numbers of individual credit unions are falling. Overall, with supervision and regulation passing to the FSA, the outlook for credit unions in the UK is better than at any time in their history. The result of the new regime will ultimately lead to a strong, secure and professional credit union sector, capable of meeting the credit needs of a wide range of persons.

	abstract = {1. Subordinate helpers in cooperative societies may gain both immediate and future benefits, including paternity and territorial inheritance. However, if such opportunities correlate with rank in the queue, it is unclear why such queues should be stable. 2. In cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus, only males are generally philopatric, and form stable hierarchical queues for the dominant position. 3. Male opportunities for reproduction are influenced both by their dominance status within the group, and their relatedness to the breeding female. For young queuing subordinates, the breeding female is typically their mother. Because of incest avoidance, reproduction is possible only through extra-group mating, even if the dominant position is achieved while the mother is still on the territory. If the mother dies while the helper is still a subordinate, he can seek matings both outside the group, and with the unrelated replacement female within the group. Finally, males can achieve the dominant position and pair with an unrelated female by inheritance, dispersal to a neighbouring vacancy, or by forming a liaison with an immigrant subordinate female that causes fission of the natal territory. 4. On average males spent more time living with unrelated females than with their mother. Subordinate males gained no survival advantages when living with their mother rather than an unrelated female, contrary to the prediction that parents facilitate the survival of their offspring. 5. Dominants and subordinates also had similar survival. Mortality accelerated over time, probably because older males invest more in extra-group courtship display. 6. Fairy-wren queues are likely to be stable because older birds are superior, and because extra-pair mating provides direct benefits to subordinates. © 2007 The Author.},

Based on a combination of nationally-representative household- and cooperative-level survey data, we find that poorer farmers tend not to participate in these organizations although they may indirectly benefit from them. When they do participate, they are often excluded from decision-making processes.

	abstract = {The 'benefits of philopatry' hypothesis states that helpers in cooperatively breeding species derive higher benefits from remaining home, instead of dispersing and attempting to breed independently. We tested experimentally whether dispersal options influence dispersal propensity in the cooperatively breeding Lake Tanganyika cichlids Neolamprologus pulcher and N. savoryi. Cooperative groups of these fishes breed in densely packed colonies, surrounded by unoccupied, but apparently suitable breeding habitat. Breeding inside colonies and living in groups seems to benefit individuals, for example by early detection and deterrence of predators. We show that despite a slight preference of both species for habitat with a higher stone cover, 40% of the preferred habitat remained unoccupied. On average, the colonies contained a higher number of (1) predators of adults, juveniles and eggs, (2) shelter competitors, and (3) other species including potential food competitors, compared to the outside colony habitat. Apparently, habitat differences cannot explain why these cichlids breed in colonies. Accordingly, dispersal may not be limited by a lack of suitable breeding shelters, but by the relatively higher risk of establishing an outside- compared to a within-colony breeding territory. To test whether cichlids prefer within- to outside-colony breeding territories, we provided breeding shelters inside the colony and at the colony edge and studied helper dispersal. As expected, significantly more shelters were occupied within the colony compared to the edge. New breeding pairs with several helpers occupied these shelters. We conclude that although breeding habitat is plentiful outside the colonies, helpers delay dispersal to obtain a higher quality breeding position within the group or colony eventually, or they disperse in groups.

As a result, the 1979 Act now reciprocates the controversial, yet flexible United States (US) legislative framework. In particular, the article examines the interpretation of the common bond, the provision of financial services and the regulation of credit unions. The article concludes that these three statutory provisions have assisted the growth of credit unions in both countries and not limited their development. However, the growth of credit unions has come, at the expense of their unique status and philosophy. It has made US credit unions, in particular, indistinguishable from banks. This is a problem which may affect credit unions in the UK.

	abstract = {Among all sectors in the Philippine agricultural economy, livestock exhibited the fastest and most consistent growth (4.6 percent on average per year) in the 1990s and well into the twenty-first century, steadily increasing its share of contribution to gross value added in agriculture from 18 percent in 1990 to 24 percent by 2003. The expansion of the industry has been propelled mainly by growth in domestic demand for meat in general, and for pork in particular, fueled by a still-rapid population growth, increased urbanization, and modest improvements in per capita income, particularly in the national capital and in major urban centers in the provinces around the Metropolitan Manila area. Pig production is the largest contributor to meat output in the Philippines. It is also an economic activity in which smallholders still dominate, accounting for close to 80 percent of total pig inventories. The strong growth in demand for pork presents a potential for increasing income opportunities, and therefore for poverty alleviation among rural and agricultural households in the Philippines, where rural poverty incidence for families remains high at 40.3 percent. In the two major hog-producing regions of Southern and Central Luzon adjacent to the national capital, however, the observed trends depict a more rapid decline in the share of smallholder pig producers in regional output, such that by 2003, smallholders held the minority share. In these two regions, although the number of registered commercial pig farms significantly increased, the number of farms raising pigs declined between the 1990s and 2000s. These numbers suggest a scaling up of larger farms and a displacement of smaller ones. The more rapid growth in larger commercial farms is not solely premised on the existence of economies of scale in production but is attributed, in large part, to the commercial sector being able to escape or at least overcome transaction costs that cannot be handled as easily by small producers. In addition, the cost advantage of large farms over small ones is also hypothesized to stem from their ability to access privileged prices of crucial inputs that are linked to policy subsidies. On the demand side of the meat industry, consuming households in the metropolis and in the major urbanizing centers in the two regions, with their higher incomes and purchasing power, are not only increasing their consumption of meat but also their demand for quality, convenience, and greater product differentiation. On the supply side, large meat products companies are vertically integrating pig-production operations; exercising control over their own breeding farms, feed formulation, and animal health services; and establishing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point-compatible slaughtering and processing plants. They are also producing differentiated meat cuts and meat products, packaging them in convenient forms, and establishing their own brands. In the regulatory scene, the government's National Meat Inspection Service is strengthening monitoring, inspection, and grading functions on the sanitary conditions of all slaughterhouses, public and private, for local, national, and international trade in meat. These changing market forces, compounded by structural factors and the policy environment, pose a serious challenge to the continued survival of smallholder pig producers. The poverty implications of the displacement of smallholders in the market raise important social questions. This report attempts to respond to these questions by investigating empirical evidence about the scale and access issues that affect smallholders. The study employs two methods to quantify the contributions of market forces and policies affecting the scale of livestock-production operations. Then it relates each contribution to measures that can be taken to overcome transaction cost barriers and policy distortions faced by smallholders that tend to ease them out of mainstream markets for their output and consign them to marginal ones. Chapter 1 provides the background of the study, states the objectives, and lays down the scale issues related to competitiveness in markets for livestock that are to be investigated. The chapter breaks down the objectives into three main questions on: (1) whether small pig-producing farms can compete with large farms; (2) the role of transaction cost barriers in smallholder participation and performance in hog production; and (3) redressing transaction cost barriers if these barriers affect small and large farms differentially. Chapter 2 lays out the two approaches that the study uses in investigating the role of transaction costs in economic activities. The first is a direct approach through a market participation model. The second is an indirect approach through the estimation of an efficiency model. A brief review of the literature on these approaches is provided. The market participation model assesses the roles of household characteristics and factors outside the household in determining participation in pig production and the level of market participation. The profit-efficiency model assesses farm-level differences in efficiency in generating profits from a given level of resources, input and output prices in terms of differences in transaction costs, and policy subsidies across the scale of operations studied (from small, backyard-level to medium-scale farms). Chapter 3 focuses on the determinants of participation by households in the economic activity of pig production. It begins by providing a brief description of the Southern Tagalog region and the subregion consisting of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon provinces (CALABARZON), where the study was undertaken. The investigation draws on field data collected in 2000-2001 from three cities in the two major pig-producing provinces in the region. Household-level data were obtained from a sample of 144 pig-producing households and 141 households not producing livestock, randomly picked from identified pig-producing villages. A probit market-participation model was estimated and results were analyzed to explain why some households engage in pig production whereas others do not. Among the significant factors that influenced the decision of households to participate in pig production were the availability of household resources, particularly family labor, and the opportunity costs of the household head and spouse in engaging in pig production, a labor-intensive economic activity. Households with more members of working age tended to participate, whereas those with household heads or spouses that were government or private sector employees tended not to be engaged in pig production. The decision to participate was also influenced by the capacity of the households to deal with fixed transaction costs related to access to financial resources for engaging in the activity and to negotiations involved in a market-oriented activity. The results of the Heckman two-step selection model reveal that the price of slaughter hogs and the access to market outlets that are not limited to the confines of the village are significant factors that influenced the household's level of participation in pig production. Chapter 4 focuses on the pig-producing households, further disaggregated into independent and contract producers. The chapter compares independent and contract farms in terms of the types of production activities engaged in and access to information and credit, feeds and growing or breeding stock, animal health services, and markets for inputs and outputs. Most contract growers tended to specialize in fattening pigs to slaughter hogs. In contrast, independent producers tended to combine the production of weaners (piglets) with slaughter hogs or specialized in weaner piglet production. Both independent and contract producers were highly market oriented, although in varying intensities, from purchasing mixed feeds and growing or breeding stock, to selling output to various outlets. Smallholders were grouped into size quintiles according to the level of their annualized outputs. The levels of activity covered a wide range. Those belonging to the lowest quintile produced very small volumes of output (averaging 315 kilograms per year). Mean output was equivalent to approximately five slaughter hogs per year, or about 20 piglets per year, in one or two batches. Producers in the third quintile produced about six times as much as the first, whereas those in the last quintile produced about 200 slaughter hogs per year, 40 times more than the average production per farm of the first quintile. In general, contract growers in the sample operated at significantly higher levels of activity than did independents, with the majority of them falling in the fourth and fifth size quintiles. Even so, they are still rightfully classified as smallholder producers engaged in a nonformal enterprise, having very similar household characteristics to the independent smallholder sample except for the number of animals kept. The two groups mainly use unpaid household labor (rarely employing hired labor) and have similar nonlivestock sector resources. Contract growers exhibited better access to quality feeds and stock, feed credit, veterinary health services, and credit for expansion purposes. Contract growers also had better access to markets for slaughter hogs, even if their location relative to that of independent producers was at a greater distance from Metropolitan Manila, the main market for live hogs. The advantage of contract growers in the market relative to independents can be traced to the former's integration into a formal institution - a feedmilling and multipurpose cooperative - for the production and marketing of their output.},

The recent dramatic decline in the number of vinegrowers has been of great concern particularly to wine producers, policy makers, and local authorities because such a pattern has had, and most importantly will have, serious economic, social, and environmental implications. The focus of this paper is on two issues. First, some descriptive statistics on the demographics of vinegrowers and characteristics of vineyards are presented and second, a probit model is developed to identify the demographic and other determinants of the probability of off-farm and off-vineyard work participation. The most important source of data information is primary data collected by the authors, using a questionnaire, which was completed by a representative sample of vinegrowers from the island of Samos. The empirical findings suggest that the promotion of vinegrowing requires policies that will enlarge the size of vineyards, promote investments in human and physical capital, and improve the public infrastructure.},

The rate to harvest crops and the corresponding capital investment are critical strategic decisions in situations where poor weather conditions present a risk of crop loss. In this article, we discuss a case study of the Concord grape harvest and develop a mathematical model to control harvest risk. The model involves differentiation of a joint probability distribution that represents risks associated with the length of the harvest season and the size of the crop. This approach is becoming popular as a means of dealing with complex problems involving operational and supply chain risk. Significant cost avoidance, in the millions of dollars, results from practical implementation of the Harvest Model. Using real data, we found that the Harvest Model provides lower-cost solutions in situations involving moderate variability in both the length of season and the crop size as compared to solutions based on imposed risk policies determined by management. © 2004 INFORMS.},

Design/methodology/approach - The research approach is empirical and descriptive. Data were gathered by mail survey from Finnish software producers. Findings - Networked firms intended to improve profitability by boosting resource efficiency, while non-networked firms concentrated on price increases. No difference occurred in firms' perceptions of their profitability. Networked firms intended to grow by mergers and acquisitions and by cooperation with partners. Non-networked firms were eager to grow by developing new software products. Networked firms intended to increase information sharing more and were more open in sharing information concerning firms' technical competencies, cost, and commitments to other organizations. Lack of marketing resources was the most important reason for firms to join a network. Research limitations/implications - The research setting (how the firms are classified in groups, for example) could benefit from deeper analysis of how network characteristics are connected and which variables best estimate and describe the degree of networking of a firm. A larger sample of firms should be covered to achieve generalizable results. Systematic comparison of industries would also provide essential information on network dynamics. Originality/value - Networked firms had grown more than non-networked firms but no connection between profitability perceptions and networking was obtained.

	abstract = {Fair trade has gained attention as an innovative market-based mechanism for addressing social and environmental problems exacerbated by conventional global markets. Yet such initiatives are also regulatory mechanisms that establish voluntary alternative arrangements for governing production, commercialization and consumption of global commodities. Based on a recent study of fair trade coffee experiences in Latin America, this paper explores the changes that fair trade represents in governance of the coffee commodity chain. It argues that fair trade coffee governance is shaped both by formal organizational arrangements for coordination and control and, less formally, by the social and political relations embedded in fair trade's commodity chain.

The forests of Massachusetts, the third most densely populated state in the United States, are threatened. Decades of high grading and the threat of forest conversion to alternative use present challenges for maintaining a forested landscape. Despite being 60% forested, Massachusetts imports approximately 98% of the wood fiber that its citizens consume. The Massachusetts Woodlands Cooperative is a forest management, processing, and marketing cooperative organized by and on behalf of forest landowners in western Massachusetts. An umbrella group certification protocol was developed to provide cost-effective forestland management certification. Members benefit from cooperative management of harvest operations, above-market stumpage payments, and value-added processing and production including marketing traditionally low-value and small-diameter material. The added revenue from developing these new markets is used to fund timber, wildlife habitat, recreation, and other sustainable forest management activities. The cooperative works in partnership with local wood-processing businesses to spur community economic development. This study on cooperatives may be a successful example of sustainable forest management that can be applied in other regions with private land ownerships. © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

It is argued that the definition of a governance mechanism's hybridity depends on the definition of the governance continuum, with the conventional market-hierarchy continuum failing to accommodate the specificity of the cooperative organization. Utilizing the logic of the property rights theory of the firm, the paper develops an alternative continuum for cooperative, hierarchical, and market organization. These governance mechanisms are shown to exhibit growing difference in the extensiveness of property rights assigned to the involved contractual parties. This continuum does not imply the hybridity of cooperatives; rather, it locates hierarchy between market and cooperative organization. The empirical validity of die new continuum is confirmed by the results of a survey of members of several Ukrainian rural cooperatives.},

We argue that the problem of governance in a cooperative is twofold and consists in designing mechanisms and setting up institutions that (1) encourage workers to define a goal that maximizes workers’ welfare and (2) induce managers to pursue and internalize such a broad goal. When compared to capital-controlled firms, the agency problems become more complex and harder to solve in the cooperative framework. As empirical evidence of this problem and its corresponding solution, we illustrate the case of the Mondragón cooperatives, explaining in detail the incentive system and the control mechanisms now in place in this successful business group. The study of the governance architecture of Mondragón may help us to propose solutions to traditional problems of the cooperative firm and to reach a better understanding of both the governance of cooperatives and corporate governance in general. © 2006 M.E.

As agriculture in this region has become increasingly intensive and specialized, land managers have tended to ignore the role of the landscape in providing goods and services such as water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. However, many farmers and ranchers claim that they would welcome an opportunity to protect ecosystem health while general consumer behaviour has indicated that they are willing to pay a premium to encourage such efforts. This article has two main objectives. First, it provides an overview of the main institutional approaches that have been developed to encourage natural ecosystem conservation and environmental and economic sustainability in the prairie landscape. Second, the discussion then centres on the role and potential of an alternative institutional approach, namely, a strategic consumer-producer cooperative. In this discussion we highlight the appropriateness, advantages, and disadvantages of consumer-producer cooperatives in altering agricultural management to enhance the ecological, economic, and social sustainability of the prairie landscape. The article will provide examples from a consumer-producer cooperative that is under development in southern Saskatchewan.},

The NGC structure, based on tradable shares that are linked to the right and obligation to deliver specific quantities of raw product to the processing facility, helps overcome the free rider, horizon, portfolio, and control problems that have plagued traditional cooperatives. Over the past several years, however, concerns have begun to emerge about the longrun viability of this cooperative form, as several large NGCs have been taken over by or converted to investor-owned firms (IOFs). This article describes how the NGC's choice of stock trading rules and procedures affects NGC formation and takeover. We consider a perfectly competitive market for NGC stock as well as discriminatory auction and competitive auction stock trading mechanisms. Drawing on results from a dynamic, heterogeneous agent model of the market for NGC stock developed by Holland, we analyze how each of these stock trading mechanisms affects the reversibility of an investment in an NGC and, consequently, the conditions under which the NGC will form or be sold to an IOF.

	abstract = {This article examines the Labour party's attitude towards the wholesaling industry. During the inter-war period wholesalers, 'middlemen' as they were commonly called, occupied the position of bogeyman in much Labour party thinking and literature. As a result the Labour governments of the 1920s took actions designed to achieve two ends: to improve the efficiency of food distribution, and to limit the power of middlemen to exploit both ends of the food production chain, farmers and consumers alike. This ideological positioning of the middleman by Labour, and the reforms introduced under the MacDonald governments, stressed the need to establish farmers' co-operatives and consumers' protection agencies, and also emphasized the importance of other measures designed to boost efficiency. However, by the time of the Attlee governments the cornerstone of the inter-war policy, the producer co-operative, had been abandoned and the focus of debate shifted to various forms of nationalization. This change of policy is examined in this article. Though post-war Labour manifestos pledged to nationalize sections of the wholesaling industry, and despite the fact that the party under Attlee discussed the nationalization of wholesaling at length, the industry remained in private hands. An attempt to understand how and why the nationalization of wholesaling was opposed within the party and shelved by the Attlee governments is central to this study. © 2007 Oxford University Press.

What women do, how they see themselves, and how others see them, reflect a dynamic and complex interplay among the social relations of production, reproduction, and consumption. Farm business organization is only one parameter in the context of patriarchal kin, community, and commercial relations.

	abstract = {This paper reviews experience with credit union demutualisation to date in the light of increasing discussion about whether demutualisation is a likely (or inevitable) future stage in the evolutionary process. It is argued that the credit union industry faces an inherent demutualisation bias which emerges as the sector develops maturity. Contributing factors include the emergence of professional management pursuing personal objectives, together with the economic realities of technological change, financial liberalisation, increased competition, and prudential regulation based on minimum capital requirements. Demutualisation incentives may partially reflect the unsuitability of the mutual form of governance in larger, more sophisticated financial institutions, but there is also a significant risk of demutualisation based on wealth expropriation motives. Alternative policies and strategies which might avoid this demutualisation bias are examined. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2005.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the potential of environmental co-operatives (EC) to deliver environmental benefits and an integrated and strengthened rural economy in the UK. It is based on research into Dutch EC, which have about 10,000 members, of which a quarter are non-farmers. The paper details the benefits EC have delivered to their members, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, the environment and the rural economy using evidence drawn from interviews with farmer and non-farmer members, farmer non-members, policy makers and academics connected with seven EC. It pays particular attention to the benefits and disadvantages of allowing non-farmer membership. It is argued that EC would be a valuable additional instrument to help deliver landscape-scale environmental, regional and rural policy objectives. However, Dutch EC have received important political and, particularly in their start-up stage, financial support, and similar support would be needed in the UK-it is argued this may be more readily available if UK EC will offer non-farmer membership. Appropriate support could be provided through developments to the Environmental Stewardship Scheme's higher level tier, by safeguarding and extending the spirit of the LEADER plus programme (which explicitly supports collective action) to the delivery of environmental benefits, and/or by encouraging the development of locally based social enterprises. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Purpose - To identify and describe work environment conditions that give rise to a shared or different state of the psychological contract for managers and employees. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews conducted with seven managers and 12 employees within an Australian credit union. Questions relate to the causes (work environment conditions) and content (salary, recognition and rewards, trust and fairness, open/honest communication) of the psychological contract. Comparative analysis techniques identify and contrast psychological contract categories of managers and employees. Findings - Although managers and employees shared similar responses as to the state of the psychological contract, they attributed different causes to these states. Managers tended to construct rational explanations and emphasise resource constraints and financial considerations, whilst employees constructed emotional explanations and attributed this situation to an unfair, uncaring or distant management. Employees regarded the Staff Consultative Committee and open-door policies as "symbolic acts" rather than genuine attempts to give employees a voice in the company. Practical implications - Aligning the psychological contract espoused by management more closely with that upheld by employees requires managers to adopt more personal, face-to-face communication strategies. The removal of status-related barriers to communication places managers in a better position to explain to employees how the organisation can meet (or not) specific contract expectations and obligations. Originality/value - Paper provides interesting insights into how contracts form within the context of work environment, HRM policy and practice, and cultural factors - work context factors largely ignored by psychological contract researchers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose-To argue a case for a paradigm shift in the way urban cooperative banks (UCBs) are managed, governed, and regulated in India to enable them to enhance their contributions to achieving greater degree of financial inclusion, and more broad-based growth. Design/methodology/approach-The paper first surveys the quantitative importance of the UCBs in India, and their key performance indicators. Various official reports by the country’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and other relevant organizations are used extensively. The paper then identifies key areas of reforms, centering primarily on the current business model, governance and regulation practices, and capital adequacy. It then argues for a change in a paradigm shift by the UCBs, and how better governance and regulatory structure can assist this shift. Findings-The paper finds that if the UCBs are to remain relevant and play a significant developmental role in India, they will require same quality of governance and regulation as well as professionalism and modernization as the mainstream commercial banks. The governance and regulatory structures need to be brought in conformity with India’s current and prospective economic structure; and relevant laws modernized. This requires a paradigm shift in the role of UCBs. Research limitations/implications-The research has been based primarily on secondary sources, particularly various reports by the RBI, the country’s Central Bank. Better understanding of the reasons for differences between well-governed and financially sound UCBs on one hand, and those that are not, requires focused interviews and more searching examination of the operating environment and financial statements of a sample of the UCBs. This could be the next stage of research. Originality/value-This paper represents a part of public debate on ways of integrating the UCBs into the mainstream banking sector. This is an important public policy issue as even though the UCBs represent relatively small proportion of the total banking assets, they still represent a systemic risk to India’s financial system, and without reforming them, broad-based economic growth would be difficult to achieve. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study investigated poultry farmers' perceptions, preferences, and use of commercially compounded and self-compounded feeds in the Oyo Area of Oyo State, Nigeria. Data were collected from 120 poultry farmers through a structured interview schedule. The study concluded that poultry farmers prefer and use self-compounded feeds (SCF) instead of commercially compounded feeds (CCF) because (a) self-compounded feeds are of better quality than commercially compounded feeds, (b) there are no quality control measures in the poultry feed industry in the Oyo Area, (c) commercially compounded feeds cost more than self-compounded feeds, and (d) farmers choose feed based on the perceived quality of the feed, their technical ability to produce feed by themselves, the cost of CCF, the storability of feed, and the cost and availability of transportation. Based on these findings, it is recommended that interested public and private agencies should organize annual extension workshops and training for poultry farmers in the study area on (a) feed formulation; (b) feed ingredient mixing and compounding; (c) selection of ingredients, mixtures, and additives; and (d) the establishment, operation, and maintenance of feed mills. Farmers should be encouraged to form feed mill cooperative societies. The performance of the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) should be monitored and evaluated to ensure its effective oversight of quality standards for agricultural products and inputs such as feeds and feed ingredients. © Springer 2006.},

HIG adoption rates and associated fish production during 1997/1998 varied according to extension intensity across three farmer groups. Short training sessions were found to be equally effective at communicating HIG technology to farmers as longer on-farm trials. Both forms of extension were more effective than farmer-to-farmer communication at producing higher fish yields. Yields across all groups, however, were significantly lower than HIG-projected yields, suggesting that extension methodology did not exclusively affect production in this system. Farmer income, land holdings, attitudes, predisposition to risk, and fertilizer price all may have affected production. Improving production will involve a multifaceted approach, possibly including development of less capital-intense technologies, focus on short training sessions, encouragement of farmer cooperatives, and advocacy of economic policies that improve farmer access to credit and local markets.},

His detailed knowledge of the strategic structure of IDOA allowed him to choose a new equilibrium. His desire and ability to communicate with every level involved in the implementation of the CCP as well as his considerable autonomy from the governor enabled him to create, articulate, and implement the strategies necessary to change the equilibrium. And finally his reputation in the aging field served as a bond that allowed him to enforce the new agency equilibrium, thereby overcoming problems of renegotiation proofness.

Using data obtained from 180 farmers in eastern Nigeria, the study found that pest and diseases with a mean score value of 4.58, non-availability of farm chemicals (4.46), poor market sales of agricultural produce (4.03), and transportation difficulty (3.83) were the major production problems encountered by the respondents. The major strategies to handle these problems included cooperative organizations (41.67%), mixed cropping (94.44%), use of family labour (53.33%), and sale of produce in external markets (45.00%).:emale respondents (χ2 = 6.34) and respondents with larger farm holdings (χ2 = 10.01), were more significantly constrained in their production activities. The need for targeted extension efforts at these two categories of farmers is therefore recommended. © 2004 Trap. Agric. (Trinidad).},

This enabled the private owners to succeed in encroaching the lands. Meanwhile the rich people in the surrounding areas brought pressure on the government to reclaim the swamp lands. The Cooperative Societies Association used to appeal to the Government to aid the association. The Government of Madras provided agricultural and Industrial settlements for the DNTs. The government assigned the land to the managing agencies on many conditions. The settlers were expected to earn an honest means of livelihood by tilling and cultivating the land. Out of seven DNT settlements established under the CT Act 1911, five were managed by the Salvation Army. Sitanagararn was managed by the American Baptist Telugu Mission, Siddhapuram was under the official management of the government.

This study uses in-depth interviews, fieldwork, and secondary sources to contextualize EPEC within the county's stories about place-within its heritage narratives. The dominant heritage narrative (depicting Lake County's character as agriculturalist, cooperative and harmonious, and antiregulatory) is shown to be a major factor shaping and justifying the creation and operation of EPEC. Despite the existence of counternarratives, the dominant heritage narrative prefigured the emergence of EPEC and helped reinforce EPEC as the county's way of handling the growth of grape growing in the region and the resulting erosion problem.

	abstract = {This study investigates the main determinants of Italian banks' cost efficiency over the period 1993-1996, by employing a Fourier-flexible stochastic cost frontier in order to measure X-efficiencies and economies of scale. Quality and riskiness of bank outputs are explicitly accounted for in the cost function and their impact on cost efficiency levels is evaluated. The results show that mean X-inefficiencies range between 13 and 15 per cent of total costs and they tend to decrease over time for all bank sizes. Economies of scale appear present and significant, being especially high for popular and credit co-operative banks. Moreover, the inclusion of risk and output quality variables in the cost function seems to reduce the significance of the scale economy estimates. Following Spong et al. (1995) a profitability test is undertaken that allows for the identification of banks that are both cost and profit efficient. The results suggest that the most efficient and profitable institutions are more able to control all aspects of costs, especially labour costs. Finally, the data are pooled to carry out a logistic regression model in order to examine bank- and market-specific factors that influence Italian banks' inefficiency. Confirming Mester (1993, 1996), inefficiencies appear to be inversely correlated with capital strength and positively related to the level of non-performing loans in the balance sheet. The analysis also shows that there is no clear relationship between asset size and bank efficiency. Finally, it is possible to infer that quoted banks seem to be on average more efficient than their non-quoted counterparts.},

The innovations adopted mostly by the respondents included fish breeding technique, feed formulation technique, fast growing exotic/hybrids and ecological disaster management/prevention. Others were pollution management, smoking equipment and brood stock selection technique. The chi-square analysis showed that a significant relationship exists between innovation adoption and the constraints to fish farming but did not show that the years of experience of the farmers have significant relationship with the constraints.

The present paper explores the ability of horticultural co-operatives in adapting to the new challenges in this sector from a productivity analysis viewpoint. Total factor productivity and efficiency are considered indicative measurements of the response of these organisations to the current market environment. In this study, Malmquist productivity indices are estimated using non-parametric techniques and taking as reference panel data of Andalusian horticultural co-operatives for the period 1995-2004. For a more in-depth analysis, productivity indices are broken down into technological change and efficiency change indicators, also considering the impact of other variables of co-operatives. The indicators obtained showed a relevant increase in efficiency for the period under study and a positive relationship between the results and quality investment. On the whole this research work adds to studies in the adaptation process of co-operatives in the current competitive scenario, offering insight into the improvement in total productivity and its correlation with several management variables in the fruit and vegetables sector.},

A few evidences are available in India when freshwater aquaculture resources (FARs) degraded under open access system are brought under a state or private or community management regime through appropriate changes in institutional arrangements and authority system. In recent years fish culture in freshwater has been managed under internal institutional structures of distributed governance or shared management system. Fishermen communities/resource users groups and the state or local government (panchayat) shared the responsibility of managing fresh water aquaculture by combining appropriate institutional skills of local resource users/local committees and technical, administration and financial resources available with the states. In the state of Chhattisgarh freshwater aquaculture has been managed under co-operative governance structure - an internal institutional structure model of distributed governance system. Looking to the importance of freshwater resources for fish culture in the state of Chhattisgarh an attempt has been made in this paper to present an overview of governance structure of freshwater aquaculture (culture fisheries in ponds and tanks) in the state and to discuss the outcomes of an in-depth analysis of fish co-operative society of Boria Khurd village of Raipur district of Chhattisgarh.

The paper argues that more local ownership and the co-operative organisational form may ensure a higher level of corporate responsibility The paper is mainly discursive, although three case-studies of companies are used to illustrate the argument: Shell, Vaux Brewery, and Tower Colliery. The central findings are that the nature of ownership, the scale of an enterprise, and the governance form are key considerations in terms of the corporate responsibility of firms. Further explorations of CSR in relation to the nature of governance and ownership of firms, and the scale of their operations, would develop and explore this paper's central argument further and thus provide more valuable insights. The paper suggests that the issue of scale and the role of co-operatives may be of more significance as corporate governance comes under greater scrutiny and sustainability plays a more central role in business practice.

	abstract = {Under the Allied Occupation, immediately after the end of Second World War, pent-up tenant farmer frustration was translated into substantial support for the Japan Socialist Party through the farmer union movement. This support was enhanced by the institutional mechanisms of the land reform process, particularly land reform committees (nōchi iinkai), in which the Socialists played a predominant role. However, as the land reform process came to an end, the Socialists were unable to capture an emerging site of institutional influence over farmers, agricultural cooperatives (nōkyō). This failure was due to Socialist fragmentation and competition for power in farmer unions with the Japan Communist Party and in the agricultural cooperatives with centrist conservative forces. The result was that the Socialists lost a key constituency that came to be dominated by the conservatives. Nonetheless, this conservatism of Japanese farmers was not due to inherent cultural orientations of the rural population nor was it simply a product of land reform. The transformation of farmers into a key pillar of conservative party support was the outcome of a political process. © The Author 2005.

	abstract = {In this article we study the cases of two credit unions, members of the Caisses Populaires Acadiennes, a cooperative movement operating in the francophone communities of New Brunswick (Canada). The first, Néguac, is located in a rural environment with important economic challenges. The second, Moncton-Beauséjour, is located in a very prosperous economic environment. These two credit unions have the additional characteristic of having experienced a merger in the past few years. We find that the role of management greatly differs from that of community's expectations. In an urban setting, competition is fiercer, management can focus more on its credit union's operations and is less scrutinized for its contribution to community. In a rural setting, parochial considerations are important, as are the credit union's contributions to various community projects. In both cases, the personal ties between employees and clients are very important social assets for the credit unions. Our study shows that even with the economic pressures justifying mergers and the re-engineering of activities, governance practices solidly rooted in the community remain important and tend to be preserved. Several facts reflect the influence of social cohesion on governance in a context of rationalization (mergers and re-engineering). This being said, we see signs that these social roots of governance evolve according to a widening of the territory of the reference community, possibly leading to a weakening of the links between governance and the parochial community and a strengthening of the links between governance and the province's francophone community.},

A survey of 220 individual farms and farm cooperatives engaged in the cultivation of peanuts was conducted during 2000 and 2002. Poor farm structure, low level of technology, and nonconformity to farm decision making impede the financial and economic development of Bulgarian peanut production and farm growth, thus limiting farm enterprises emergence into competitive economic units financially operative in a freemarket economy. The underlying cost structure, couple with small farms, averaging 0.8 ha in size, prevent farmers from capturing economies of scale, limit farm profitability and hence farm modernization. The lack of owned farm machinery, equipment and storage facilities renders the restructuring and specialization extremely difficult. However, peanut production is still a viable farm enterprise for Bulgarian farmers.},

	abstract = {Credit unions are member-owned, voluntary, self-help, democratic, not-for-profit institutions that provide financial services to their members. They have both economic and social goals. Over this last decade they have achieved remarkable growth levels and currently there are 600 such organisations in Ireland, with approximately 50 per cent of the adult population of Ireland belonging to a credit union. Accounting for credit unions is a much-neglected area and relatively little is known about the sector's accountability. This paper presents the results of an initial empirical study of the financial accountability of Irish credit unions. A series of interviews and a basic content analysis of 178 recent financial statements were used to identify the views of key stakeholders with respect to the discharge of financial accountability by credit unions and the current quality of financial reporting. Overall, the research points to a sector where financial accountability through the medium of the annual report is weak and possible adverse consequences of this are explored. On the basis of the interviews it is suggested that if changes in financial accountability are to be achieved then some more proactive engagement of parties external to the management of individual credit unions is needed. © 2004, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The first result shows an average rate of decline in the number of UBPC of around 60 units per year. Parameters measuring production also show average annual negative rates of decline: 38,800 harvested hectares, and 860,000 tons of sugarcane. Agricultural yields remained stable during the study period. Other important indicators such as revenue, cost and profitability also show negative trends. Factors that appear to be limiting efficiency and profitability include, among others, a timid system of material incentives, lack of autonomy, excessive governmental control over input and product markets, and absence of foreign investment. © 2005 Centre for Research into Post-Communist Economies.},

This analysis also focuses on the particular interwar conditions that favored the protectionism of the agricultural economy and the "State's supervision" of cooperatives, an essential element of agrarian policy, even during the first post-war period. Finally, we examine developments relating to the cooperatives during the transition from dictatorship to democracy, namely, the subsequent legislative interference, doubtful investments, as well as the transformation of the organizations into an arena of self-interest for political parties and their leaders and into a means of implementing government social policy.},

A multistage sampling technique was adopted for selection of district, blocks, village and finally pearl millet growers. As per objective of the study, the 30 heads of pearl millet cultivating farmers were taken from each selected village to make the sample size of 120 farmers. The study reveals that the constraints related to inputs like high price of weedicides, pesticides and fungicides and lack of irrigation facilities were very serious in nature. Failure of crop due to unfavourable weather conditions and using of seeds without treatments were very serious and lack of knowledge about time of application and recommended dose of fertilizers were serious constraints in production. In case of marketing of produce, the constraints like distress sale due to immediate need for money was very serious, whereas lack of warehousing facilities, lack of procurement of produce by government, low support price of produce and lack of co-operative organization for marketing of produce were found to be serious. Lack of demonstrations and trials of pearl millet production were considered to be very serious constraints by the respondents. The serious constraints identified by the farmers in case of technical guidance were lack of guidance for controlling insects-pests and application of pesticides and fungicides, lack of guidance for chemical weed control and chemical weedicides, lack of guidance for seed treatment, lack of knowledge of current advances for pearl millet production and lack of knowledge of recommended dose of chemical fertilizers. To overcome these constraints, efforts should be made to provide full package of practices about pearl millet production to the farmers well in advance by the extension personnel by visiting their fields.},

	abstract = {This article reports the findings of a project entitled 'The participation of members in mutual businesses'. A previous project developed a theoretical model of what makes people participate, focusing on the participation of public service users in council housing and social care services. The current project builds on this work, applying the 'mutual incentives model' to a population sample of area committee members and a random sample of non-participant members of a very large UK consumer co-operative, the Co-operative Group. Two arguments are presented as to why such research is needed. First, member participation in co-operative and mutual businesses is becoming an important issue both for this sector and more generally for public policy. Second, a comparison between a public services setting and a co-operative setting enables us to extend and further test the theoretical model. Two main features of the model are outlined: a 'mutual incentives theory' that goes beyond other models to combine individualistic and collectivistic motivations, and the 'participation chain', a synthesis of existing knowledge that joins motivations to three 'links' that we call 'resources', 'mobilization' and 'dynamics'. The article then summarizes the project methodology, and reports the main findings. As in the public services project, on the 'demand' side, collectivistic incentives prove to be dominant over individualistic, but with some individual 'internal' benefits also being important. On the 'supply' side, skills derived from previous experience were important, as were a positive evaluation of opportunities to participate, and recruitment through existing networks. We then compare the findings to those from the public service users and from a regional co-operative society; Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Co-op. Collective motivations are dominant in all three datasets, but are shown to vary in interesting ways that have important implications for member participation strategies. © CIRIEC 2004.

But the pricing system (CIF or FOB) and the extent of local competition define the level and spatial rate of change in prices. Estimations of an empirical price-location function for Iowa during the spring of 2003 suggest that prices near the plants of four conventional businesses conform to the CIF pricing model.

Despite their apparent growth in number, agricultural cooperatives have made only a limited impact on economic, social, and industrial development of the country and democratization of the agricultural sector and the community. The reasons for these pertain to some basic problem areas such as finance, integration, training and research, administration, legislation, and auditing [Mülayim, Z. G. (2003). Kooperatifçilik, Yetkin Yayinlari. Ankara]. To further explore these problem areas, this paper focuses on cooperative-shareholder relations in three major types of cooperatives in Turkey. According to the survey results, ADCs have emerged as the most prominent type of cooperative in terms of their members' participation into cooperative activities. The research results suggest that all members of ADCs were actively engaged in trading with their cooperatives, whereas 90% of members in ASCs and 80% in ACCs were trading with their cooperatives. When the three types of cooperatives are compared to each other with respect to members' perception of democratic administration, relations with the state organs, awareness of cooperative principles, and frequency of visits to cooperatives, ADCs are in a favourable position compared to ACCs and ASCs. The same situation is also valid for economic relations and interest in financial matters. ACCs come first in supplying farm inputs and they are followed by ASCs. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to explore the management of natural resources by self-help farmer cooperatives. The study was carried out in five local government areas of Southwest Nigeria. These local government areas are forest zones covered by derived savannah. The raining season normally starts around April and ends in October/November, followed by a dry season. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people. Several methods were used to collect information. These included group discussions and questionnaires. Results from the study show that women have played a major role in almost every aspect of agriculture. Farmers possess valuable knowledge of the natural resources in their environment. They have made use of changes in soils and topography, which have resulted in planting patterns in the scattered farms around the villages and distant farm plots. With the help of cooperatives, farmers are taught how to develop innovatory regenerative techniques to conserve the tree stock on the farm. These techniques focus around the preservation of forest species. This study has shown that given the opportunity, local farmers can face the environment and tackle the problems when given the required support.},

Based on the growing literature on cooperative organizational models, it is expected that the new organizational patterns in the New Zealand dairy cooperatives in the early 2000s are a consequence of market changes. Case studies of the three cooperatives are conducted, focusing on the organizational structures in terms of collective versus individualized attributes. The dissolution of the New Zealand Dairy Board created new market opportunities for the cooperatives. Hence, the co-operatives had reason to develop new market strategies, and in order to pursue these well, they changed their organizational structures. The observations indicate that more liberalized and open markets require cooperative organizational models with more individualized traits.},

The construct "vaguely defined property rights" is an expression of the organizing rationale of neoclassical economics itself, as this view reaches the concrete limit of historical financial structures of cooperatives, what it can intellectually specify and appropriate, given its individualizing perspective.},

	abstract = {The notion that cooperatives should prosper when markets are poorly competitive has long been maintained as the competitive yardstick hypothesis. If cooperative formation is rational when market imperfections arise, we might wonder if dissolution is rational when the imperfections fade. In this article, we show that the answer is yes. More generally, we show that cooperatives would wish to choose from a continuum of cooperative, new-generation, and IOF models as market conditions and interest groups vary. For this purpose, we develop a general organizational framework of the agricultural processing firm, paying attention to the mechanisms distinguishing the cooperative from the IOF structure, the tension between active and retired members, and the influence of competition in raw and finished product markets. Optimality is considered first from the perspective of the cooperative member, in terms of maximizing the expected present value of net cash flows, then from the perspective of the policy maker, in terms of minimizing the probability of financial ruin. We find, as markets become increasingly competitive, that a traditional cooperative encourages lower investment and higher probability of bankruptcy than does the IOF. However, member's willingness to capitalize the cooperative improves abruptly as inactive members gain influence on the cooperative board or as the firm's financial structure merges toward the IOF model. Our findings are illustrated using data from the internal records of Tri Valley Growers, which until its bankruptcy in 2000 was on of the nation's leading agricultural processing cooperative.

A case study of the COATO farming cooperative showed us that its environmental management, focused on prevention logic, has had a positive net effect on its environmental performance. Besides, the order in which these practices were adopted favoured the development of new organisational capabilities that have contributed to the appearance of advantages derived from the greater accumulated experience of employees in creating new projects that are designed to reduce residues and pollution. COATO has also obtained a competitive advantage in differentiation thanks to an improved brand image and to its increased credibility in business relationships. Finally, a positive correlation exists between the pioneering proactive strategy adopted by this cooperative and the improvement of its firm performance with respect to the other firms in its sector. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This makes them a potential tool in the fight against financial exclusion. Yet, the UK credit union movement is not regarded as being successful, even though there is evidence of much financial exclusion. This study is cross sectional in form, and evaluates characteristics that may contribute to the success of the UK credit union movement at national and regional level, in 2000. The findings are used to consider the impact of recent regulatory changes on the movement. The key findings are that there is a significant relationship between the success of a credit union, its size and the deprivation of the ward from which it sources its members. More specifically, larger credit unions and those located in more affluent wards, are more successful. Affiliation to the Irish League of Credit Unions and having a common bond of occupation, are also found to be contributing factors to credit union success. These results are taken as providing support for the recent changes implemented by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which is likely to result in the emergence of larger credit unions (through mergers), run by appropriately qualified persons, serving a more mixed-income membership base. It is, however, noted that the history of the UK movement is one of missed opportunities and only time will tell whether credit unions have the wherewithal to accept current opportunities. © CIRIEC 2005.},

	abstract = {Since Vietnam applied the "Doi Moi-Renovation" policy in 1986, and especially in 1988, the contract system between agricultural cooperatives and farmers was applied in agricultural production. Furthermore, the Land Law in 1993 indicates that farmers could use their land for the long-term (from 20 to 50 years). Therefore, land fragmentation in Vietnam has become a common phenomenon in all localities. This paper aims to provide an analysis of land reform and LC processes in Vietnam. In this regard, the study concentrates on the following issues: (1) to trace back former land reform in the period 1945-1953, in order to identify its results and errors; (2) to analyze contemporary LC in terms of an institutional analysis from the national to the commune level; (3) to study the procedure of LC in Dong Long Commune, Tien Hai District, Thai Binh Province. The main results of thi s research can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the land reform program carried out in the period 1953-1956 included 3 principal stages. The main objective of the program was to reduce the influence of colonists, feudalists and landlords by redistributing land to the landless peasants and laborers. As a result, over 810,000 hectares of land which belonged to them were confiscated, requisitioned, and purchased by the government. The land was then redistributed to 2,104,138 landless households, including 8,323,636 peasants and laborers. Secondly, a significant result of the LC process was to reduce by 50 % the total number of land parcels in Dong Long Commune. There were two general impacts of this process: (1) farmers were able to shorten the distance from their houses to the land parcels. Therefore, labor costs as well as long-term investment were reduced, resulting in increased benefits from agricultural production. (2) Land management activities at the commune level became much more effective because of the reduction in the number of parcels as a result of combining public land into a bigger area and building up the Land Use Planning Program for long-term developmment.},

Ten farm pairs, each of which consists of one organic and one conventional farm with less than 10 ha of fig plantation, were selected from five Fig Sales Cooperative (Taris-Incirbirlik) regions of Aydin Province with varying agro-ecological conditions. Although six of the organic farms matched or exceeded the production of their conventional counterparts, the three-year mean yield of the organic farms as a group was 5% lower than that of the conventional farms. However, excluding organic certification costs, mean variable costs and net income were similar for both groups, mainly because organic price premiums received by the farmers compensated for lower yields. If current organic certification costs paid by firms are included to farm budgets, the price premiums paid to organic producers would have to increase to 22% in order to equal the net incomes from conventional dried fig. Conventional farmers identified low and unstable prices as the main constraints for sustained production and stated further intensification of production as their main goal. Organic farmers focused on farm diversification and agronomic practices that permit organic farm management. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The purpose being to identify the benefits, limitations and lessons for the management of people in the co-operative and mutual sectors. Design/methodology/approach – The problem of inadequate Personnel or HRM systems in the majority of co-operatives has been established by the author over a period of seven years, field work with co-operative organizations including the international co-operative alliance (ICA), asian confederation of credit unions (ACCU), and the British society for co-operative studies. Direct interviews and a sample of HRM and Membership Relations audit forms developed as part of the ongoing field research and special project work have been applied to various co-operative contexts in all the regions of the ICA. Findings – The findings are that co-operatives generally are lagging behind the private sector in their application of all four approaches. Mostly smaller co-operatives lack effective basic personnel systems and few of the larger co-operatives go beyond HRM. This failure to develop clear programs for the utilization and development of their people is a missed opportunity. Practical implications – The membership base and its roots in a community of shared interests means that, whilst co-operatives have lessons to learn from all four approaches, they can and must go beyond them if they are to optimize their people-centered business advantage in the marketplace. Originality/value – The paper suggests a new strategy for co-operatives of Co-operative Social Capital Management to help them compete, whilst retaining their co-operative difference. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based initiatives at achieving sustainable consumption objectives. Design/methodology/approach – A new multi-criteria evaluation tool is developed, from New Economics theory, to assess the effectiveness of initiatives at achieving sustainable consumption. The key indicators are: localisation, reducing ecological footprints, community building, collective action and creating new socio-economic institutions. This evaluation framework is applied to an organic producer cooperative in Norfolk, UK, using a mixed-method approach comprising site visits, semi-structured interviews and a customer survey. Findings – The initiative was effective at achieving sustainable consumption in each of the dimensions of the appraisal tool, but nevertheless faced a number of barriers to achieving its potential. Research limitations/implications – Future research could examine the sustainability preferences of non-consumers of local or organic food, to compare responses and assess the scope for scaling up initiatives like this. Practical implications – Ways forward for community-based sustainable consumption are discussed, together with policy recommendations. Community-based initiatives such as the local organic food network examined here should be supported to offer a diversity of local action. Originality/value – This paper presents the first empirical evaluation of a local organic food network as a tool for sustainable consumption. It makes a timely and original contribution on environmental governance and the role of new institutions which enable consumers to change their consumption patterns. It is of interest to academics, practitioners and policymakers concerned with sustainable development. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {This paper aims to describe and explain the changes which have taken place in the rural areas of Israel by focussing on a particular type of community-the moshav, which is a planned smallholders' settlement, based on family farms and legally organized as a cooperative society. An analysis of the changes that have taken place in the moshav in the past few decades reveals a process of rural restructuring, similar to that which is occurring in many developed countries. New economic activities have replaced farming as sources of income, and newcomers, mostly of urban origin, have invaded rural communities in search of a better quality of life. These changes derive from a combination of structural changes in agriculture, changing government policies and cumulative decisions of rural households. The result is a more heterogeneous moshav-physically, economically and socially, and growing regional, inter-village and intra-village disparities. These developments have a direct impact on the organizational structure of the moshav, its environmental qualities and its exchange relations with the urban sector. As part of the ongoing process of change the moshav is gradually losing some of its unique features, which formed the basis for its identity as a special type of rural community. This leads to the question of whether the moshav will be able to develop a new identity as a distinct type of rural community, or turn into a suburban or urban community. The answer will depend largely on the direction taken by government policy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Agricultural cooperatives are experiencing complex governance issues, particularly in light of increased heterogeneity of member interests, and increased market and regulatory pressures. Member commitment is often recognized to be a necessary ingredient in the cooperative success, and while primary agricultural cooperatives are built on that commitment, new generation cooperatives need not be. In this article we argue that some of the governance issues may be alleviated by the application of creating catalytic mechanisms, a process that builds cohesion, preserves cooperative identity, and is based on cooperative principles and values. We illustrate this technique with examples of successful agricultural and rural cooperatives that already use such mechanisms in their management strategies.},

	abstract = {Conservation of tropical biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has become more important as the area covered by natural ecosystems decreases. We analyzed the effects of local livelihoods, cooperative types, and selected biophysical variables (elevation, slope, percent shade, distance to the forest, coffee density, and coffee age) on tree biodiversity in shade coffee cooperatives of El Salvador. Tree inventories from 51 quadrats in coffee cooperatives included 2743 individuals from 46 families and 123 identified tree species. Species richness and tree diameters differed among some cooperatives, with greater richness associated with greater stem density; other biophysical variables had little impact on diversity. The amount of shade in the coffee plantations differed among cooperatives, particularly in the wet season. Of the tree species reported in a recent study of a neighboring forest and in the cooperatives (N = 227 species combined), 16% were present at both sites. The three coffee plantations shared 35% of total species reported from all cooperatives. Our research shows that the number of tree species found in a coffee plantation increases with the density of shade trees included in the system. In turn, agroecological management, as influenced by farmer livelihood strategies and cooperative types, directly affects shade canopy composition. Important factors to take into account are the types of farmer organizations present, the cost of maintaining species of conservation concern, and the potential benefits that conservation could bring to the livelihood strategies of farm households. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A case study in southern Brazil examines a situation in which the lack of effective monitoring and enforcement contributed to the decline of a cooperative, and asks why these activities were ineffectively applied. The literature suggests that the lack of application would be because the provision of monitoring and enforcement is itself a second-order public goods problem in which the whole cooperative benefits from the maintenance of discipline, but the costs fall on individuals who work to maintain it. This case study reveals contextual factors related to motivations for cooperation which may be more important in explaining the reluctance to impose discipline and the subsequent decline of trust and commitment among cooperative members. The study suggests that the components of an effective disciplinary system include rule formulation, monitoring and enforcement activities, accompanied by norms regarding the role of discipline in relation to overall cooperative objectives, and regarding the roles and responsibilities of leadership and general membership. A disciplinary system will be most effective when it is applied with attention to how it affects both external and internal motivations.},

The prevention of deforestation - and the re-forestation of degraded land - could become a key elements to national climate protection programs of some developing countries. Agroforestry may offer economically viable windows of opportunity for sustainable use of tropical forests whereas additional funds (e.g. through "Clean Development Mechanism") will be required to make re-forestation programs profitable. Alternative management practices in rice-based systems may offer win-win options to reduce emissions and - at the same time - to obtain another improvement in the production system, namely through optimized timing of nitrogen fertilizer, temporary drainage in irrigated rice fields and integrated residue management. Introducing pasture in degraded land can sequester substantial amounts of carbon (similar to re-forestation). Future research has to include participation of stakeholders from all conceivable levels, i.e. farmers' cooperatives, non-governmental organizations, national agricultural research centers and extension services, to devise simple and financially interesting incentives for reducing emissions. The feasibility of environmentally friendly production techniques has to be disseminated to the public through 'success stories' (documented in public media) and demonstration farms.},

The polity consists of informed and uninformed voters: only informed voters join parties, and the party campaign chest, the sum of its received contributions, is used to reach uninformed voters through advertising. A party is a cooperative organization of its members. Parties compete with each other strategically with respect to policy choice and advertising. We propose a definition of political equilibrium, in which party membership, citizen contributions, and parties' policies are simultaneously determined, for each of four financing institutions, running the gamut between a purely private, unconstrained system, to a public system in which all citizens have equal financial input. Equilibria under these institutions are computed by simulation for an example. The representation and welfare properties of these four institutions are compared from these simulations.

LNFCS have continued to purchase glass eels, when market prices have been favourable, to supplement the natural glass eel input. This study assesses the impact of these stocked glass eels on the Lough Neagh yellow and silver eel fisheries with a predictive model based on natural and stocked glass eel input, effort and environmental variables. Despite the final models' limitations to assess conclusively the contribution of the additional purchased glass eels the models can be used cautiously to predict, in the short term, yellow and silver eel output.

Management and employees in this sector are increasingly required to demonstrate their competitiveness in terms of financial measures and performance criteria. Yet, very little is known about the impact of these shifts on employee relations in not-for-profit organisations. Drawing on detailed case study research into credit unions, which are not-for-profit players in the predominately for-profit financial services sector, the paper highlights the contradictions inherent in, and consequences that result, when not-for-profit organisations adopt similar customer and human resource strategies to their for-profit counterparts. The findings in relation to credit unions have important implications for not-for-profit organisations in the voluntary and welfare sectors where the adoption of strategies from the for-profit sector could potentially undermine the ability of emloyees to deliver care to some of the most vulnerable members of our society.

Farmers in two case study communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal face high transaction costs as reflected primarily in their low levels of education and literacy, lack of market information, insecure property rights, poor road and communication infrastructure, and long distances to markets. Analysis of the reasons why cooperatives were originally established in various parts of the world suggests that most of the causes (such as poverty, market failure and high transaction costs) also apply to the study farmers, as do the seven international principles of cooperation. Smallholder farmers in both case study regions have the potential to grow high-value crops such as vegetables, fruit and cut flowers. In the supply chain from farm to market, the optimum boundary for each organization involved in the chain (e.g. cooperative and investor-oriented firm) depends on the minimum operational and transaction costs for each business.},

The movement focuses on the integration of vertical and horizontal resources and promotion of the development and expansion of internal potential (neili) within the cooperatives through the introduction of external factors. To be specific, new rural reconstruction is about the comprehensive reconstruction of the peasants in economic, cultural, social, political, and other fields, which requires the utilization of existing village resources such as religion, clans, institutions (tizhi), and so on, so that former expressions of cooperation will bring about new ones. The breakthrough in Lankao county centers on cultural troupes (wenyi dui) and seniors ' associations.

The latter invokes a familiar dichotomy to explain the failure of rural cooperatives: a powerful state bureaucracy imposing inappropriate policy on an undifferentiated and uniformly powerless peasantry. The case study presented here suggests that, on a number of crucial issues (privatization of co-owned means of production, the employment of labour-power that was unfree), it was much rather better-off peasants who overruled bureaucrats and imposed their own accumulation project.},

Defining a cooperative broadly as any type of alliance formed by producers for their mutual benefit, we base the discussion on three types of cooperative; traditional, "new generation" and learning networks. Our main focus is on cooperatives as an alliance between members, but we also discuss alliances between cooperatives. We find that there is a gap in the literature relating to the analysis of alliances with more than two members (such as cooperatives), so the linkages between the theories and cooperative types must be seen as being somewhat tentative. We hypothesise that the RBV, social network theory and trust and cooperation theories are in fact, applicable to multiple-member alliances, but their relevance is likely to become less as the number of members increase. © 2006 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IAMA).

The sample consisted of 1,051 survey responses from CEOs and board chairs representing 713 credit unions. As member-benefit nonprofit organizations, credit unions rely almost exclusively on voluntary board members in an oversight capacity. Results support the contention that board development practices lead to more capable board members, and the presence of these board members tends to explain board performance. The study advances the understanding of nonprofit board development practices by further defining the concept and proposing an empirically tested assessment strategy. Furthermore, the findings support using specific recruitment practices that should strengthen nonprofit boards. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Three strategic choices were identified as potentially efficient, that is, the option to exit either the sector or the organizational form,to continue strategically and structurally with moderate changes to organization form, or to shift to a more radical form of organizational structure. This article and session attempt to describe and analyze organizational design initiatives adopted since the mid 1990s. This article complements and expands a typology of discreteinstitutional arrangements (i.e., cooperative models) based upon a broad definition of ownership rights comprising residual claim and control rights (Chaddad and Cook). We argue that cooperative models may be distinguished by how ownership rights are defined and assigned to economic agents tied contractually to the firm (members, patrons, and investors). In addition, we develop a set of observations that suggest a research agenda based on a new institutional approach to understanding organization change in the food system.

In the European agriculture, expectations for attaining sustainable and competitive agriculture rely to a great extent on the cooperative sector's ability to adapt to new market conditions. These challenges have led marketing cooperatives in the fruit and vegetables sector to consider improvements in productivity and sound environmental performance. The study analyses the total factor productivity related to environmental variables in this sector using a parametric-stochastic approach and panel data on Spanish cooperatives over the period 1994-2002. Additionally, the determinants of environmental productivity are examined econometrically. The estimates obtained show an increase in efficiency for the period under study and a relationship between productivity changes and management factors, such as labour quality, capital intensity and environmental spillover. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

For several years now, however, two different tendencies in the development of the European co-operative movement are becoming apparent and they are analysed in this study. One is towards the creation of growth processes through formulas which aim to bring under the same roof asset holders who by their very nature are a difficult fit, all the while trying to maintain certain cooperative principles. And on the other hand, a tendency towards the creation of micro-companies that act in local markets and allow for territorial development by means of the mobilization of local resources, based on local allegiance of the partners and democratic participation. © 2006 CIRIEC.},

	abstract = {Coffee is one of the most important Third World export commodities, and 70% of the producers are small-scale farmers. Coffee producers are often poor and marginalised, and their situation is aggravated by fluctuating market prices and collusive behaviour among intermediary coffee purchasers. Coffee co-operatives may potentially increase the incomes of these farmers by distributing a larger share of the final price to the co-operative members. Co-operatives can also have a pro-competitive effect on imperfect market situations, and thereby increase income levels also for non members. Moreover, they have the potential to educate and empower marginalised farmers. However, lack of finance and problems with free riding, costs of control and a too short time horizon are problems faced by co-operatives. Because of that, benevolent governments or NGOs have tried to support co-operatives with finance and expertise, but often with an unsuccessful outcome. The Fair Trade system distributes money to small-scale coffee producers via carefully selected co-operatives. The study of Fair Trade co-operatives in Chiapas shows that they are successfully functioning organisations, and that they do seem to have a pro-competitive effect on an imperfect market situation. But the co-operatives also have many disadvantages compared to their private competitors. This means that they could probably not have reached their level of success without the premium received from the alternative markets (Fair Trade and organic). Thus, the support from the Fair Trade system seems to strengthen agricultural co-operatives.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen fertilisation is a source of potential groundwater pollution and is a key issue in the current debate about the environmental impacts of agricultural production. It is also a key element in the management of cropping systems by farmers. Therefore, cropping system design entails the understanding and evaluation of farmers' fertilisation practices. Biophysical models describing the soil-plant system can serve this purpose. A comparison between model outputs and farmers' practices was made of a set of 128 apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) plots from 31 members of a farmers' co-operative in south-eastern France. Farmers' fertilisation practices were compared with theoretical practices generated by a series of soil-plant system models of increasing complexity, each model giving the amount of nitrogen that should be applied to the plot according to the knowledge included in the model. The model that reproduced farmers' fertilisation practices most closely was the most complex, taking all plant requirements, soil organic matter and residue mineralisation, denitrification and irrigation supply into account. A Monte Carlo method showed that the differences between farmers' practices and model outputs were not random. Spatial analysis showed a strong spatial organisation of these differences, mainly due to three farms. This congruence between farmers' practices and model outputs suggests the existence of some indicators that depict the N nutrition status of the orchard as a basis for rules indicating how much nitrogen should be applied. The spatial analysis suggests the existence of farmer and neighbourhood effects, which need to be explained. Models appear to be useful tools to study farmers' practices by removing biophysical effects (soil, variety, etc.). This raises new questions concerning agricultural research at the interface between the biophysical and social sciences. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Probability distributions of milk price and yield are derived to expose business and financial risk faced by dairy farmers. After designing appropriate dairy risk management strategies, existing risk management strategies were compared by using second-degree stochastic dominance (SSD). The results show that the total risk of dairy farmers is 57 % and the possible loss is approximately 2000$. Business risk is 50 % while the other half is attributed to financial rigidities. Research results also suggest that the most appropriate risk management strategy is transferring risk in order to ensure sufficient returns to meet debt services and to operate expense commitments in the research area. Based on the SSD results, income diversification through obtaining off farm income is the best way to transfer risk and marketing milk through sales cooperatives is the following alternative for dairy farmers.},

Notionally, a cooperative is an alternate form of economic organization, but it is not discussed frequently in public debate or economic theory texts. One reason for this could be that at least in India, largely, cooperatives have a public image of either being a sham or being government–managed. The present study is part of an endeavour to critically examine this image and has led to documentation of some self–reliant, real cooperatives of long standing in a variety of settings. This is a case study of a 58 year old, self–reliant and member controlled consumer cooperative. Besides checking on its cooperative and self–reliant character, its structure and processes have also been documented in some detail to aid in its replication.

	abstract = {Oyster fishery is one of the most important coastal fisheries of Mexico. Production from the Gulf of Mexico coast makes up 93.4% of national production; during 2000-2002 it reached over 49,000 mT, with value of 9.2 to 15.5 million USD. Production is based on enhanced beds management. It is an activity of social importance, as many coastal communities find their income and work opportunities in it. In the state of Tabasco there are 1,371 oyster fishers in 14 cooperative societies, and 3,000 shuckers. There is an extensive bed management activity with seeding of collected spat and shell laying. Although a minimum legal size of 80 mm is required, it is not observed. We identified the growth equation parameters for size structure data for five beds from three lagoons. Maximum height varied between 118 and 140 mm with means between 58 and 63 mm. The von Bertalanffy growth equation parameters were L8 between 124 and 154 mm, with K between 0.71 and 1.21. In most cases a significant influence of seasonality was detected, mostly during winter, but at some localities it was during summer. Total mortality Z varies from 1.64 to 2.39. As no data on natural mortality M were available we applied 25, 50 and 75% of Z to M, which allowed us to model the behaviour of the populations under different rates of fishing mortality F and the impact of different M in yields. We conclude that the populations are over exploited in size and this is affecting yields. Besides, the populations are at risk of collapse if natural mortality increases awing to any environmental impact. It is recommended to increase mean size to 90 mm which means a minimum catch size of over 70 mm, as required by the official norm, this would increase yields in weight 100% and there would be a significant number of organisms to buffer any increase on natural mortality. © 2007 University of Salento - SIBA http://siba2.unile.it/ese.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the financial structure of a marketing cooperative (MC) and the requirement of the domination of control by the members is analysed from a transaction costs perspective. A MC receives less favourable terms on outside equity than a conventional firm because the decision power regarding new investments is not allocated to the providers of these funds. This is a serious threat to the survival of a MC in a market where efficient investments are characterised by an increasing level of asset specificity at the processing stage of production. A MC is predicted to be an efficient organisational form when the level of asset specificity at the processing stage of production is at a low or immediate level compared to the level of asset specificity at the farming stage of production. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Owing to the nature of the export channel environment, exporting firms cannot rely solely on their internal competencies for achieving competitive advantages and export success. Instead, exporters must look beyond the firm's boundary to tap into the distinctive competencies of external actors such as distributors if they want to realize the full potential of their products. Yet, there is little empirical evidence of the strategic impact of resources and capabilities that can be shared in marketing's cooperative relationships. This study raises two research questions: (1) does a firm's relational capability contribute to its export competitive advantages? and (2) does a firm's relational factors make an incremental contribution to its export advantage and performance beyond the contribution of firm factors. A significant conclusion of this study is that after controlling for internal firm factors, relational factors make a unique contribution to both the competitive advantages of the firm and its export performance. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Although it focuses on a single case study from Mumbai (previously Bombay), the case suggests that the conventional policy focus on mortgage finance for individual consumers may be insufficient, and that policy makers should also consider the problem of development finance for housing producers, including consumer cooperatives. Second, it indicates that successful financing strategies are ikely to involve an overlap of both formal and informal practices. Third, in the documented case the tenants' group succeeded in leveraging the development potential of their land to cross-subsidise its housing costs. However, the paper highlights the difficulties involved and cautions against any policy reliance on such a strategy as a financing panacea.},

	abstract = {Both in conception and practice, cooperatives in the Punjab have been an important component of the government's development policy. The model was conceived as a 'multipurpose unit' aimed at serving its members by supplying credit, improved farm inputs, storage facilities, marketing assistance etc. In practice, however the major function has most often remained limited to the provision of credit and the improved farm inputs. As the bulk of resources have been supplied by the government, cooperatives are as much an agent of government administration, as a voluntary organisation. Even from the narrow perspective of their role as a vehicle for channelling government funds, cooperatives have been more active in distributing loans than in collecting these when due. The Punjab cooperatives are rural institutions which permit collective action by the more progressive farmers and which mediate between these farmers and the government. It enables the administration to target benefits and regulatory policy on that group of farmers, large or small, who contribute most to governments development goals-those who adopt improved technology. Nevertheless, cooperatives seem to have been less successful in accomplishing the governments' stated purposes, as the strategy has produced dissemination of benefits generally only to the most privileged sections of the rural society. The wider conclusion is that the experience in the Punjab hardly amounts to a test of the appropriateness of the institution of cooperatives as a development agent. The divided and hierarchical social structure of rural Punjab may point to the need for greater appropriateness of some alternative institutional device to encourage development.},

One issue underlying the nature of competition between the two, however, concerns the most appropriate way to model their interactions. Two possible approaches are the dominant-firm price-leadership model and the generalized Cournot model. In the former model, credit unions act as fringe suppliers who are price-takers in a homogenous product market. In the latter, they possess (limited) market power. One way to distinguish the two is by examining the impact of credit union market shares on their pricing, as the two models imply differing effects. Our results are more consistent with the "credit unions as fringe suppliers" view. Using a pooled cross-section time series of 77 small local consumer lending markets throughout the U.S., each with 10 observations over 5 years, the focus is on a loan product ex ante thought to be sold in local markets, unsecured (non-credit card) loans. For this product, increasing credit union market shares reduces credit union loan rates, consistent with a fringe supplier hypothesis.},

Many recent models attempt to explain this variation on the basis that a dominant who benefits from the presence of subordinates may offer them incentives, in the form of reproductive opportunities, to remain in the group. While most societies contain multiple members, however, these models have considered only the relationship between a dominant and a single subordinate or have assumed that all subordinates are identical. We develop an incentive-based evolutionary stable strategy model of reproductive skew in three-member groups, in which subordinates may vary in their opportunities for independent reproduction, their contribution to group productivity, and in their relatedness both to the dominant and to one another. Our model demonstrates that the conclusions of two-member models cannot all be generalized to larger groups. For example, relatedness among group members can influence whether or not the dominant does best to offer staying incentives to subordinates in a three-member, but not a two-member, group. Both the degree of skew and group stability depend on the relatedness between subordinates as well as on the relatedness of each to the dominant, and the incentives that each individual subordinate receives are influenced by the traits of the other. Whether such effects increase or decrease skew and group stability depends crucially on whether a third group member increases group productivity to a greater or lesser extent than the first.},

This paper examines the local-level effects of that paradox by briefly reviewing the history of the Sri Lankan state's use of cooperatives since independence in 1948 and by looking at the rise and fall of one particular pottery production and marketing cooperative over that same 50-year period. In the process, we see that the effects of state economic policies are not determinative but, rather, inherently uncertain because: 1) the ideological apparatus of which the policies are a part shifts over time; and 2) center policies interact in unpredictable ways with local agents, discourses, and agendas. These findings help us to better understand the complex and contradictory nature of relations between "state" and "village".},

	abstract = {The system of agricultural production in the Red River Delta based on village-level agricultural cooperatives has changed since Resolution 10 of 1988. The function of cooperatives was greatly reduced, and the household came to be considered as an autonomous unit of economy. In the process of change in the cooperatives' function, economic activities took on greater importance. A new law on cooperatives in 1996 also promoted the establishment of new types of cooperatives as autonomous economic organizations. Discussions on cooperatives' function, however, have tended to be too abstract and idealized and to lack specific detail. This paper, therefore, evaluates the economic activities of cooperatives based on an analysis of actual economic activities in one village. Coc Thanh Cooperative (CT) in Nam Dinh Province was chosen for a case study, and its cooperative's economic activities were evaluated from the accounts of revenue and expenditure of the Irish potato business, including the cultivation, and the storage and sale businesses. It was found that the executive staff of CT actively managed the potato business and produced a profit for the whole cooperative. They controlled the material cost and the cooperative's profit according to fluctuations in climatic conditions and market prices in order to generate profits both for the potato farmers and for CT. Besides their regular salary, they received a bonus as reward for managing the potato business. Why did the cooperative manage the potato business as CT's business, rather than leaving it to individual farmers? The advantages of having the potato business run by CT were that it could provide funding and information, function as an arbitrator, operate in line with government policy, and perform welfare works. The disadvantage was its economic inefficiency as a profit-making organization. To improve its economic efficiency as a profit-making organization, CT paid a bonus to the executive staff, thereby motivating them to efficient management. CT was an organization with two purposes: the pursuit of economic efficiency and the promotion of welfare works. Since villagers have to get funds by themselves and do public undertakings and welfare works in their own village, economic activities by farmers' associations such as cooperatives should be promoted.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the dissemination potential of organic farming in Andalucía, using the case of Olivarera de los Pedroches, a small farmer cooperative. This will be done in the search for an agroecological strategy in the olive tree organic agricultural sector. A comparative analysis of organic and conventional olive oil production is made: both in economic terms, and regarding employment creation, taking into account its environmental benefits. This will permit us to shed light on certain elements necessary in the design of rural policies linked to this economic sector, and in the family farming social stratum. After a brief analysis of the Andalucían inequality structure in rural areas - both historically and at present times - this work presents the following issues: (i) a systematic characterization of European olive cultivation, with special reference to the Spanish and Andalucían situations; (ii) an exploration of the socio-economic impact of the case study within the context of the major actors involved, and their relations in terms of its reproducibility, taking into account their relationships with institutional and policy arrangements. Organic agriculture in Spain has developed slowly since 1995 - the year in which aid towards this type of production began to be established - and, at present, begins to show an exponential increase. Many farmers began the transition to ecological handling of olive groves. Consequently, the organic management of the olive groves and the sale of organic olive oil can be a stimulus to farmers to increase their profits. Hence, it can be a fundamental pillar on which to establish rural development in areas with a high level of importance concerning this crop. In this work, data clearly show that, in spite of high costs, organic olive farming has advantages over conventional agriculture in terms of incomes and employment.

Information interchange among library and other academic applications is often hindered by the lack of application interoperability. This hindrance may be overcome through the development of standards that allow for digital libraries to exchange and share information with other applications. The Graduate Program in Production Engineering (PPGEP) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) launched its Theses and Dissertations Bank (BTD) in 1995. BTD is possibly the first online academic digital library of theses. From a digital document repository, BTD evolved into a system that combines bibliometry and informetry features. BTD is used by students and faculty in their research activities, but also by decision makers from industry and academia. They use it, respectively, to search for specialists and to measure interest and knowledge interchange among PPGEP research areas. This article presents the history, features, and development prospects for the BTD project. The integration of BTD with other academic applications, especially those of the Brazilian national science and technology platform, is emphasized. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Experience has led to a sharp turn from supply led finance to developing sustainable financial intermediaries. Having encountered many, detrimental and costly failures with the supply led approach, there is excitement following emerging successes of the 'new approach'. There are several success stories documented from Asia, however these are not replicable in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper presents an emerging sound model of an RFI in the region, i.e. a model built by The Kilimanjaro Co-operative Bank of 1995 and Savings and Credit Co-operatives Societies (The KCB-SACCOS model) in Northern Tanzania. The KCB-SACCOS model has managed to overcome difficulties that have led to failures of former rural financial institutions. The successes of the KCB-SACCOS model are attributed to its foundational basis and key operational features. It is an organisation that originates from the grassroots. There is also a strong sense of ownership by the 'client-owner', democratic leadership at SACCOS and a sound SACCOS' representation at the KCB policy body. SACCOS act as strategic nodes of a web to reach a wide client base. The KCB-SACCO model has strategically tapped on the coffee economy and fits well within the socio-economic milieu of the local people and makes use of principles found in the local informal financial practices. The paper elaborates on these features and draws lessons for one approach to develop sustainable rural financial institutions in sub-Saharan Africa.},

This spread of the Leviathan has been accompanied by a gradual but pervasive deterioration of governance. There is therefore the need for a new paradigm that recognizes that ‘government failure’ is a much more important problem than ‘market failure’, based on a recognition of the strengths and the weakness of the state and the people. A democratic society has enormous potential for entrepreneurship, innovation and creative development. The people, their diverse forms of activity and association such as companies, cooperatives, societies, trusts and other NGOs must be allowed and encouraged to play their due role. The state must focus on what it alone can do best and shed all activities that the people can do as well or better. The heavy hand of the government in the form of incentives, distorting laws, rules, regulations, procedures and red tape, have also corrupted industry, business and other organized interest groups. These must be removed so as to release the energy of the people. The state should confine itself to managing the economy so as to accelerate employment and income growth in a self-sustaining manner, ensure that all citizens receive their entitlements of basic public goods and services, and empower the poor so that they have equal rights (and responsibilities) with other citizens. © 2002, Sage Publications.

Credit unions are particularly vulnerable to contradictory accountability requirements, because they can serve a number of different socioeconomic purposes. They may therefore face multiple lines of managerial and political accountability in a situation where they remain highly dependent on external stakeholders for funding. Survey evidence shows that the measures widely used to gauge credit union performance are not consistent with the policy objectives of the key stakeholders setting them. Taken together, they also fail to provide a balanced scorecard to support effective internal management decision making and external scrutiny. It is contended that key stakeholders need to compensate for the currently skewed performance scorecard with indicators that are sensitive to credit unions' specific objectives and to the stage they have reached in the credit union life cycle of development. Proposals for a wider and more appropriate suite of performance indicators are therefore outlined.},

The literature reports that firms are increasingly entering into long-term, high dependency exchanges as a result of: increased demand for quality goods, demand for variability of goods, demand for constant innovation, severe price competition and increasing technology costs. These changes are forcing firms to enter into complex relationships with other firms in order to remain competitive. Examples of such relationships are: relational contracting, network organisations, strategic alliances and horizontal co-operation. The increase in number and complexity of these exchanges in an environment characterised by uncertainty has led to the increased interest in the use of obligation contracting. Furthermore, this interest has been reinforced by the changing nature of products being exchanged. More knowledge-based products and information-based modes of production necessitate the sharing of strategically sensitive data. Hence the rise of importance of obligation contracting is not only due to the increased number of complex exchanges in uncertain environments, but also the very nature of the goods being exchanged.},

Although organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and Schulze-Delitzsch credit cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission of aiding the poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s, however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for promoting urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial institutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new cooperatives contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry into the Czech national life. © 2004 by Agricultural History Society. All rights reserved.},

However, the private companies which have stepped in to replace seed parastatals in southern Africa have proven no more effective in meeting the demands of smallholders. The Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, concluded in 1994 as part of the Uruguay Rounds of GATT negotiations, as well as certain biotechnological innovations such as Terminator or Traitor technologies, threaten to further undermine local seed production and consumption by destroying the informal seed sector so central to agricultural production in the region. What alternatives exist? The success of Zimbabwe's maize seed network offers some insight. Resting on a unique relationship between government and nationally based producer co-operatives, Zimbabwe's maize programme was able to provide nearly every farmer in the country with hybrid maize suited for local growing conditions.},

The decline of manufacturing and agriculture has reduced the share of credit going to these sectors.

This entailed close sustained fieldwork with actual cooperatives, which was achieved by investigating the two largest farmer-controlled enterprises (FCEs) in Wales - Clynderwen and Cardiganshire Farmers Ltd, and Wynnstay and Clwyd Farmers Plc, who also collaborated in subsequent management appraisal and remedial action. The paper concludes that benchmarking is strategically feasible, that it has a favourable impact on the perceptions and attitudes of staff and members of participating cooperatives, and that it yields workable priorities and management recommendations, which can be implemented. Wider adoption of the technique by cooperatives is therefore recommended as a viable survival strategy - an alternative to the recent preference for abandonment of cooperative status. This is of particular significance for the marketing/entrepreneurship interface of FCEs in Wales.},

	abstract = {A close examination of the organisation of the clothing industry in Thailand exhibits a rather paradoxical situation: although the structural features of the sector — breaking down of the production process, high labour intensity, low asset specificity, unskilled labour - seem to legitimise a market co-ordination mechanism, it is a close, durable and multiform co-operation which cements the relations between contractors and subcontractors, as well as between the subcontractors themselves. We defend the idea that this kind of cooperative organisation of economic activities represents an appropriate answer to the flexibility required by ever-changing markets, and thus an appropriate industrial organisation model for the development of manufacturing activities in emerging economies. Co-operation is understood here as a mechanism of temporal coordination of economic activities which, far from replacing the market co-ordination mechanism, rather completes it. © 2001 European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes.},

Farm cooperatives undoubtedly belong to this group. In recent years, Spanish farm cooperatives have been experiencing substantial business development. This process is a consequence of the latest changes in the regulations governing Spanish cooperatives. Major cooperative groups with high turnovers have developed in this positive environment. Although there are differences between countries, the European cooperative movement is a good example of the prominence that cooperatives have achieved in many sectors. Their traditional goals are changing and one of their current priorities is to meet the requirements of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) as regards agricultural multi-functionality. Nevertheless, the principles of this concept were already present in their own tenets. This paper aims to show the role of the cooperatives in the new social requirements, taking into account their functioning principles and the new conceptual frame they are involved in.},

However, the comparison of the present level of social capital indicates that the level of social capital is significantly higher in Denmark than in Poland.

In promoting transboundary cooperation, Germany has pursued an agenda of institutionalization based on the vertical and horizontal integration of different spatial levels of transboundary interaction through both state and nonstate actors that represent European border regions. This essay characterizes and discusses the development of transboundary cooperative organizations along Germany's border and the attempts to establish a system of multilevel governance to address border‐related issues. Germany's track record in the latter respect is mixed. Intergovernmental rivalries, as well as basic design flaws in European policy are singled out as primary obstacles to more effective cooperation. The overall political context of transboundary regionalism is framed here in terms of Germany's pivotal economic and political role within the overall project of European integration. Given the ambiguities of cooperative experiences, the essay concludes with more general research questions regarding the significance of transboundary forms of regional governance within an evolving European Union. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {New cooperative organizations, including rural community cooperatives, rural cooperative foundations (RCFs), rural shareholding cooperative enterprises (RSCEs) and farmers' specialized associations (FSAs), have mushroomed since the reform in rural China and play a very important and indispensable role in promoting the Chinese rural economy. However, when comparing the Chinese rural cooperatives with standardized foreign cooperatives, in terms of the controlling decision-making power and residual claimant right, only a small number of cooperative-oriented RSCEs and FSAs are similar to their foreign counterparts. Furthermore, some of the Chinese rural cooperatives could be regarded as quasi-cooperatives, while some so-called cooperatives are, in fact, investor-oriented firms (IOFs). Since there is no legislation that covers cooperatives in China, governments at different levels may vary in their attitudes and behaviours towards different types of rural cooperatives. In addition, the existing national income distribution system and macro-economic framework, which are biased towards urban areas and urban industry, together with the imperfect commodity and production factors market, make governments intervene directly in the economic activities of rural cooperatives in order to realize their macro-economic goals. Meanwhile, rural cooperatives, out of concern for their own economic interests, sometimes actively seek protection from the state.},

In the last two decades, the definition of what constitutes a "common bond" has expanded dramatically. This Note argues that, as a result of the changes that the redefinition of the "common bond" requirement has produced, credit unions now have the ability and the incentive to engage in the same types of lending discrimination that led Congress to impose the Community Reinvestment Act upon banks. Thus, this Note contends, credit unions should be subject to a community reinvestment law of their own.},

Based upon examination of the foundational TQM texts and of 25 implementation guides, we show how the language of 'empowerment' and 'self-management', central to the TQM mission, is often used in equivocal ways that compromise the meaning of these concepts as they were originally developed and used by radically egalitarian grassroots organizations. We also show in several respects how TQM's organizational changes may further perpetuate inequality among workers. By distilling the key ideal-typical features of the total quality organization and comparing them with the ideal-type characteristics of the machine-based bureaucracy and of the egalitarian-democratic organization, we bring into sharp relief how they are not the same. In bringing to the TQM literature the practices and standards developed over a 150-year history by genuinely egalitarian cooperative organizations, we are able to show the profound differences in form that prevail despite their parallel language. Should TQM practitioners wish to adopt the substance of these shared control methods, they would do well to learn from the examples of the grassroots organizations that pioneered these empowerment methods. © 1999 SAGE.},

Cooperative selling institutions are potential catalysts for mitigating these costs, stimulating entry into the market, and promoting growth in rural communities. Trends in cooperative organization in east-African dairy are evaluated. Empirical work focuses on alternative techniques for effecting participation among a representative sample of peri-urban milk producers in the Ethiopian highlands. The variables considered are a modern production practice (cross-bred cow use), a traditional production practice (indigenous-cow use), three intellectual-capital-forming variables (experience, education, and extension), and the provision of infrastructure (as measured by time to transport milk to market). A Tobit analysis of marketable surplus generates precise estimates of non-participants' 'distances' to market and their reservation levels of the covariates - measures of the inputs necessary to sustain and enhance the market. Policy implications focus on the availability of cross-bred stock and the level of market infrastructure, both of which have marked effects on participation, the velocity of transactions in the local community and, inevitably, the social returns to agroindustrialization.

Participatory appraisal of the fishing community revealed decreasing reliance on fishing income with many fishermen moving away to supplementary occupations because of declining fish catches. Illegal fishing and theft of fishing gear resulting from open access, difficulties encountered in enforcing fisheries regulations and the need for fishermen to find alternative sources of income during low water levels are the major management problems. The top-down centralized management approach previously practised was ineffective in addressing any of these issues. Therefore, the possibilities and limitations for introducing co-management as an alternative management strategy were discussed. Financial hardship coupled with perceived benefits through state sponsored welfare schemes caused a positive attitude change among fishermen, making them respond favourably to fishery management. Establishing a licensing system for controlled access, ensuring greater user-group participation through equitable distribution of state sponsored benefits among members, attempting to enforce penalties for illegal fishing linked with surprise checks to enforce management regulations, and obtaining stakeholder perceptions regarding management issues are some of the recent steps taken by the Fishermen's Co-operative Society which would positively contribute towards developing effective co-management in this reservoir.},

Three smallholder irrigation management systems namely the government managed Agritex, the farmer managed community, and the informal bani (dambo) are compared. In the Agritex schemes, participating in labor groups is the only variable influencing financial performance. None of the variables studied are important on the community schemes, perhaps because unlike on Agritex schemes, where the government makes production decisions, community scheme farmers make their own decisions. In the bani schemes, marketing cooperatives, credit use, literacy, record keeping, and the gender of the plot holder are significant. The government should consider extending credit, developing sustainable production recommendations, and developing training programs directly applicable to the bani environment. The bani system achieves the most equitable income distribution and is more efficient than both the community and Agritex systems. The government policy of ignoring this system in development efforts directly contradicts the concepts of equity and efficiency. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Because of these constraints, small scale tanneries can not afford to have their own effluent treatment facilities and therefore, combined effluent from all tanneries are to be brought to a centralized place for treatment. This facility is called a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). For operation and maintenance of CETP, small scale tanners formed a co-operative society. The expenses for operation and maintenance of CETP are being shared by participating tanneries. Wastewater management for the cluster of small scale tanneries was studied in details and various measures were incorporated to improve performance of the CETP and also to improve treated effluent quality to confirm standard prescribed by regulatory agencies. Performance of existing CETP was evaluated. Based on the results, bench scale laboratory treatability studies were conducted for improvement in treated effluent quality and also to suggest appropriate modifications to the CETP. These studies are detailed in this paper. © Selper Ltd, 2004.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the current regulatory framework for community development financial institutions (CDFIs), which aim to enable ‘socially excluded’ people and enterprises to access finance. Its focus is primarily on the UK, though account is taken of developments in other EU member countries and at the EU level. In the UK the most developed regulations relate to industrial and provident societies, which are essentially financial cooperatives lending to small enterprises and not for profit organisations, and credit unions, which tend to concentrate on personal savings and finance. CDFIs lie on the boundary of what is currently understood to be charitable status, but the Charity Commission announced a new charitable purpose, ‘community capacity building’, in December 2000 and committed to developing clear guidelines on the charitability of CDFIs by the end of 2001. Current regulatory arrangements are assessed and it is found that, apart from credit unions, which have been brought under the supervisory wing of the Financial Services Authority, CDFIs tend to operate in a context of ‘benign neglect’. While recognising that heavy-handed regulation might stifle growth, it is argued that the downside of neglect could be uncertainty, which might also blight the development of the sector. An alternative, relatively liberal, regulatory framework is proposed, including self-regulation for the smaller institutions via associations. It is concluded that the type of regulation should vary with the size, status (mutual vs non mutual), and source of finance (deposits vs risk capital). © Henry Stewart Publications, 1358-1988.},

In descending order of importance these factors are: the co-operative form of organisation, contact personnel, in-store specials, responsiveness, communication policy, and price comparisons. Price comparisons with the products/services offered by competing retail stores were found to have a negative impact on the members’ assessments of value. Moreover, when comparing value judgements on the basis of the variables, education and number of years the respondents had been with the co-op, the results showed that the more educated the members were, the more likely they were to give feedback to the organisation. In addition, members that had been with the co-op for one to three years were more apt to believe that management would respond to their suggestions than the respondents who had been with the co-op for more than nine years. Implications for strategies that promise to create value and influence the members’ retention decisions are discussed. © 2001, MCB UP Limited},

The policy was disallowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1998, but revalidated by the U.S. Congress later that year. Allowing credit unions to attach multiple membership groups has contributed significantly to rapid growth in the industry. As credit unions add unrelated groups and expand, the prospects for separation between ownership and control increases, creating potential agency control problems. This potential is compounded by the one member, one vote governance structure of credit unions. This research finds empirical evidence that agency problems grow as credit unions add membership groups and members. If a credit union takes on more than one membership group, and as membership increases, management is apparently able to channel residual earnings away from members (in the form of higher net interest margins) toward itself (higher salaries and operating expenses). © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

These concepts are important in informal governance systems such as mutuals because they economise on transaction costs and promote efficient exchange. In this respect, the paper argues that mutuals have a comparative advantage compared with joint stock banks in ameliorating problems associated with adverse selection and moral hazard. These comparative advantages, however, are enhanced in small mutuals such as credit unions which focus on relatively small memberships with a common bond. The paper concludes by suggesting that although the credit union movement will not necessarily develop along similar lines to the building societies, it does have a future in providing banking facilities to the relatively poor and disenfranchised sectors of society.},

Whole field management (WFM) was compared with SSM using either three acre grids or soil type for soil sampling and fertilizer recommendations. The data indicate that site specific P and K application on corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) did not reliably increase net returns. The main effect of the site specific P and K applications on physical quantities of fertilizer was to redistribute the nutrient applications within fields. Both grid and soil type treatments had lower net return standard deviations than WFM. Both mean-variance and stochastic dominance (SD) analyses indicate that the soil type approach dominated the WFM for risk averse decision makers.},

Large multi-nationals have moved to take advantage of these developments with the construction of agri-food chains. These chains are being facilitated via various mergers, acquisitions, and alliances, with the power, and deepening power of such deep-pocket organizations as Cargill, ADM, and ConAgra. Cooperatives have been integrated into these chains for their core competencies, generally for their supply functions, and capacity to handle primary commodities. These direct links to the farmers serve as markets for biotechnology innovations, and as a source of raw material for later processing. Agricultural cooperatives in general are not well suited to compete with these giants, given they are highly specialized at the first handler level. However some cooperatives are able to enter the competition along the lines of multi-nationals competition, i.e. non-price competition in product differentiation, branding, advertising, research and capacity expansion. Farmland, Gold Kist, AGP, Land O'Lakes and Growmark are examples. The cost of these positionings is to shift these organizations toward positions that are characteristically less cooperative, and more bureaucratic, and more top down, though likely more efficient, and with greater market penetration.},

These results tend to suggest a more active role for this segment of the rural society so as to achieve rural development through combining women and livestock development. In the light of these results, the following policy suggestions are made to fully and productively exploit the women-livestock linkage. (i) Channels of information, credit, inputs and access to markets have to be aimed at women as they played a very important role in livestock keeping and decisions related to livestock productions. (ii) The existing extension set-up working to promote livestock production in the rural areas has a typical social obstacle not being able to contact the farm women to extend transfer of technology. This difficulty poses problems for the extension wing to approach those who actually undertake and decide livestock production activities. This warrants positioning appropriate female frontline extension officers to interact and offer first hand information to the farm women. (iii) There is also the need for bringing the services available to rear the animals physically closer to women. (iv) In spite of the fact that there is a close and more productive association between farm women and livestock, women participation in training programmes have not been satisfactory, primarily due to the socioeconomic impediments that exist. Hence, efforts are the need of the hour to make appropriate measures to train the farm women in scientific management practices. (v) Promoting intensive livestock rearing in the rural areas may encourage the females to participate more in livestock keeping as this practice did not require farm women to take animals for grazing far away from home. And (vi) encouraging the formation of rural women livestock farmer's co-operative society may increase female participation in livestock rearing.},

Government efforts to reform the financial system are at best piecemeal. This paper analyzes the political, social, and economic context of Taiwan's local financial institutions, a body whose problems are symptomatic of the general banking sector in Taiwan. The paper finds that Taiwan's local financial institutions are deeply embedded in the Kuomintang (KMT)-centered political economy, and are thus not easily subject to large-scale reforms. The ascension to power by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) since the 2000 presidential elections should pave the way for more serious reforms. Difficulties still abound, however.},

Although market orientation has been considered one of those critical resources, there is little understanding regarding how it is created and nurtured in business relationships. In the context of asymmetrical channel partnerships dominated by a downstream leader, in this paper we present a model where the upstream follower's market orientation is promoted as a consequence of the leader's use of authoritative mechanisms of coordination. Some hypotheses are presented and empirically tested in a sample of agricultural cooperatives that maintain channel partnerships with second-order marketing cooperatives. The results indicate that formalization, participation, input control, and behaviour control are coordination mechanisms that lead to improvements in market orientation. Implications for interorganisational theory and managerial activities are discussed at the end of the paper. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Specifically, this research focuses on the impact of trust on co-op members' performance, satisfaction, and their commitment to remaining a part of the co-ops. We examine trust along two dimensions: cognitive and affective. We argue that cognitive-based trust will be more salient in some contexts while affective-based trust will be more salient in other settings. Findings suggest that in both co-ops, trust among members and trust between members and co-op management are important predictors of group cohesion, which is a measure of the strength of members' desires to remain in a group (co-op) and their commitment to it. As hypothesized, there are differences in the effects of cognitive and affective trust, depending upon differences in the contexts represented by the two co-ops. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The tow key assumptions are constraints on lump-sum transfers from poorer members and dispro portionate control rights wielded by wealthier members. Transfers of rents to the latter are achieved by depressing prices paid for inputs supplied by members and diverting resulting retained earnings. The theory predicts that increased heterogeneity of landholdings in the local area causes increased inefficeincy by inducing a lower inputs price and a lower level of installed crushing capacity. Predictions concerning the effect of the distribution of local landownership on sugarcane price, capacity levels, and participation rates of different classes of farmers are confirmed by data from nearly 100 sugar cooperatives in the Indian state of Maharashtra over the period 1971-93.},

Identity formation unfolds in an arena characterized by competition for land based on differential access to various sources of power. Historical identities from the pre-communist past, the recent communist past, and those developed in western Germany during the period of separation all provide the basis for emerging identities. The logic and reality of this redefinition are embedded in wider political and economic interests that are themselves inconsistent and in flux.},

This article deals with the major transformations which the Desjardins movement experienced, from the creation of the first caisse populaire in 1900 to the situation existing at the end of the twentieth century. Using an approach at the junction of history and sociology, it considers the Desjardins movement as one of the components of what Alain Touraine calls a 'social development movement'.

An important element in this article is the empirical study, where we analyze the education and training of people involved in olive oil-producing cooperatives in the most important olive oil production area in the world, Jaén, Spain. Prior to our analysis of education and training, we first demonstrate the importance of cooperation in the Spanish olive oil sector. The thesis underlying this work is that the poor level of formal education and the lack of specific training represent a serious obstacle to the business development of these societies. After looking at the central problem of this study, we analyze the formal education of the various groups making up cooperatives (members, elected boards, managers and workers), as well as the specific training (offered by the firm itself or by other bodies), in terms of the number of courses attended or made available to the members. In this article we also pose the following question: are professionalization of the cooperative and education in cooperative values enough to solve the problem of management in cooperatives? Finally, we draw some conclusions from this study.},

	abstract = {A concrete alternative economy has been developing in Brazil since the end of the 1980s, which involves both country and city workers and is based on the structuring of solidary economic enterprises (SEE), in which self-developed popular cooperatives stand out. This alternative economy has brought with it new challenges, among them the need for ongoing technical, administrative and political education as a fundamental element in the search for equilibrium between social and economic issues. This article analyzes the Solidary Economy in Brazil, particularly from the standpoint of the challenges faced by the cooperative agrarian reform of the Landless Rural Workers' Movement (MST). Starting from the historical process in which landless workers began to organize, agrarian cooperation has become an important tool for the workers' settlements. On the other hand, the reality of the capitalist economy has obliged cooperative workers to adopt administrative tools that contribute toward the social and economic viability of their enterprises. The backdrop to this issue is the need to deepen the debate about the possibility of conceiving SEEs that are capable of survival and growth in the capitalist economy, incorporating technical progress, rationalizing productive and work organization, bringing social benefits to their members, and acting as the political force behind the workers' struggles, as well as ensuring democratic and autonomous administration.},

Specific attention was given to risk income behaviours of LICUs. It was found that loan to asset ratio positively influenced the magnitude of income to asset ratio, while the investment to asset ratio had a negative effect on the income to asset ratio. LICUs that employed managers had higher incomes to asset ratios than those with volunteer managers serving in this capacity. The delinquency rate and income to asset ratio were positively related, but negatively related to delinquency rate squared indicating that when the delinquency rate increased at an increasing rate the income to asset ratio fell. LICUs portrayed three risk behavioural patterns, each associated with size or income of the organization: (1) small LICUs had high risk behaviour, (2) middle income LICUs were risk neutral, and (3) large LICUs accepted higher risks as income increased.},

The results of our survey of Australian credit unions, in which 70 per cent of respondents reported experiencing some bankruptcy-related default on personal loans, indicate managers do not impose more stringent lending conditions on high-risk borrowers.

In addition, trust derived from a unique environment based on a village structure where a few families dwell not to mention "everyone knows each other well" has also become institutionalized. In this setting, a complex and multi-dimensional property rights could have developed. Moreover, the Confucian order, historically institutionalized in China, has differentiated the respective roles of the public from the private and the center from the local through a network intertwined by relationships (guanxi-based network), allowing them to be relatively autonomous from each other (embedded autonomy). This institutional tradition of the Chinese society has re-emerged with the coming of the reform age. The reform reintroduced the revival of the traditional family household, as a cooperative unit for the insiders and, at the same time, as a competitive unit against the outsiders; and its renewed close relationship with the local governments have given birth to the township village enterprises. Based on reforms of this nature, which have occurred from the bottom and approved by the center state ex post, China was able to experience the implementation a new form of transition to capitalism, i.e., rural industrialization. In this process, China's guana-based township-village enterprises were able to secure the fitness to react to market competition despite their collective ownership nature.},

Although the practice of growing trees by the Indian farmers is as old as the cultivation of crops, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 first articulated the need for government involvement in this activity on a significant scale. Consequently, social forestry projects were started by many of the State Governments in India in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Later, the National Forest Policy of 1988 also emphasised the role of social forestry as a source of raw materials for forest-based industries. This paper attempts to describe and evaluate three of the social forestry development models, namely, the State Forest Departments (SFD) model; the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) model; and the Tree Growers' Co-operative Societies (TGCS) model. Each model is presented briefly and illustrated through a case study. The evaluation is done using the criteria of efficiency, sustainability, equity, and people's participation. First, a brief presentation of each of the three models is given and then an evaluation of each model is attempted. The paper is mainly based on the research work done by the author and partly on the work done by the other researchers.},

The proposed test is implemented with data for the Irish dairy-processing sector. The findings suggest that Irish co-operatives behaved “as if” they were profit maximizers, and we could find no evidence that this behavior coincided with postulated co-operative pricing rules. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the economic impact of the EU dairy quota on the Irish dairy-processing sector. We also discuss the emergence of Public Limited Companies (PLCs) as the dominant organizational structure in the Irish dairy sector. [JEL citations: D21; Q13.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While the paper briefly presents the organizational structure, membership, financial status of the society, the main objective of the paper is to highlight the salient features that have led to its success. The declining yield in the farmer's fields as a result of waterlogging and salinity is referred to highlight the need for drainage in the area. Evidence is presented to show that implementation of drainage will strengthen the financial position of the society since it is linked with the financial position of its members. The society is keen to takeover the small drainage infrastructure created and if appropriate funds and institutional support is available, to expand this activity. If the society takes over the project upon withdrawal of government support, this society would be the only one that would truly show the concept of irrigation and drainage go together being handled by a single society.},

	abstract = {During surveys conducted in the fields at village Siar in district Ludhiana of Punjab, India, crops were found infested with four rodent species, namely, Bandicota bengalensis, Rattus maltada, Tatera indica and Mus spp. Survey of rodent control practices by farmers revealed that farmers (n=20) carry out rodent control as a regular practice but 80% of them, depending upon the level of damage to crops, conduct symptomatic control treatments with zinc phosphide. However, in general they expressed dissatisfaction about the effectiveness of zinc phosphide baiting for which the major causes were found to be the lack of pre-baiting, use of incorrect methods of bait preparation, multiple baitings of zinc phosphide at short intervals and non-removal of left over rodenticide bait and dead rodents after the treatments leading to poison-bait shyness and individual rather than campaign approach to rodent control. Village level training and field demonstrations organized with the help of three organizations of the village, namely, the Pendu Vikas Ate Mulazam Bhalai Sanstha Sangh, the Siar Pandher Co-operative Society and the Gram Panchayat, to an assembly of about fifty farmers resulted in partial success as determined on the basis of post-training survey of these parameters from a sample of 20 farmers in adoption of regular rodent control at recommended timings (45%) and pre-baiting before the use of zinc phosphide (25%) with correct method of bait preparation (60%). However, only three farmers (15%) treated rodents in the uncultivated and wasteland areas adjoining their crop fields and only one (5%) organized rodent control on large areas along with his neighbours. No farmer could be convinced for removing left over rodenticide bait and dead rodents from the fields after the treatments. Farmer's field demonstration trials were carried out at four fields each of 7.5 hectare size in different blocks of the village. Rodenticide treatments under experts' supervision in the fields designated as maintenance (M) fields resulted in 94.94% rodent control with 0.005% bromadiolone followed by 2% zinc phosphide baiting in rice fields and 85.42% with 2% zinc phosphide followed by 0.0375% Racumin baiting in wheat fields. With the absence of the expert during the treatment in N1 fields with free supply of rodenticide and education and training, rodent control success decreased non-significantly which further decreased significantly without the free supply of rodenticides as in N2 fields both during the kharif and rabi seasons. The reference fields (R) had more rodent damage than in the treated fields. This comparative study revealed that for success of rodent control at farmer's fields not only the education and training of the farmers but the availability of the rodenticides are the critical factors.},

Credit unions espouse the principle of gender inclusiveness, which is viewed as a fundamental cooperative concept. Based on a survey of 500 Irish credit unions, this study explores the role of women in credit unions. Judged against participation rates for women in the labor market and in specific organizations such as trade unions, the study suggests that gender balance in credit unions is superior to that elsewhere in Irish society. There is, however, some evidence of gender imbalance in the composition of credit union boards with this being most visible for key decision-making positions such as Chair and Vice-Chair. It also emerges that gender imbalance becomes more pronounced for larger credit unions supporting the contention that women are found in greater numbers on small and less well-connected not-for-profit boards.},

Female African lions demonstrate a unique form of plural breeding in which companions consistently produce similar numbers of surviving offspring. Consistent with theoretical predictions from models of reproductive skew, female lions are unable to control each other's reproduction because of high costs of fighting and low access to each other's newborn cubs. A female also lacks incentives to reduce her companions' reproduction, because her own survival and reproduction depend on group territoriality and synchronous breeding. Consequently, female relationships are highly symmetrical, and female lions are "free agents" who only contribute to communal care when they have cubs of their own.},

The results indicate that the most successful cooperatives are those that meet one or more of the following conditions: 1) the cooperatives are made up of a core of women with leadership skills; 2) there is an authority that encourages and supports women's venture; and 3) their establishement is based on a bottom-up approach. The women's cooperatives managed to professionalize their part-time work. They created a source of income for rural women and gave them independence, power of control and self-esteem. Furthermore, the cooperatives resulted in placing the localities, in which they were established, on the Greek map of "alternative tourism".},

	abstract = {Agricultural markets are characterised by thinner margins, greater price and income volatility. Despite these changes, agricultural raw material markets are increasingly characterised by the vertical co-ordination of farmers and processors. The organisational form of a marketing co-operative is a common means adopted by farmers to achieve this end. In a world increasingly concerned with the importance of the separation of ownership and user, the survival and growth of agricultural co-operatives (in which the primary users of the services are also the main owners) is linked to their economic role, to how members exercise their property rights, and how inputs are used by the co-operative. This paper provides a function that summarises the economic role of agricultural co-operatives and goes on to analyse the contribution to the economic performance of Portuguese wine co-operatives (PWCs) made by the use of property rights, and the skills of the human resources and technology employed. The results of a multinomial logit model show that PWCs would indeed be able to improve their economic performance through the application of integrated management strategies to solve common property and horizon problems, as well as increasing their recruitment of skilled professionals in the areas of management, wine production and marketing, and by the adoption of new technologies of production and packaging. © 2002 CIRIEC.},

	abstract = {In the post-World War II era, nation-states have been sufficiently curbed in their individualistic pursuit of goals and payoffs by the proliferation of international organizations IOs and regimes and the internalization of international norms and rules by domestic societies. The modern nation-state has undergone significant changes both in terms of its purpose and sovereignty. States have traditionally been based on territorial factors. Increasingly, however, state participation in the global economy has led to the former's integration with the latter and, consequently, an increased degree of interdependence among states. The result has been the rise of trading states which measure themselves by their relative shares of the global economy and not by territorial size or military power. The pervasiveness of economic interdependence has constrained both internal and external aspects of state sovereignty. States must harmonize internal policies to conform to the requirements of international institutions and regimes. In addition, the growing power of domestic actors has forced decision makers to take greater cognizance of the domestic audience, and has led to the phenomenon of two-level game, in which domestic considerations impact on international relations and vice-versa. At the same time, participation in IOs and regimes constrain a state's external sovereignty by limiting policy choices and enforcing compliance with international obligations. This erosion of the traditional conceptions of state sovereignty has been accelerated by a combination of the increased power of international regimes and domestic forces, and the increased mobility of capital and labour. These factors have led to the development of what Richard Rosecrance has termed the virtual state. But as this combination of factors has constrained state sovereignty in several areas, it has also augmented the power of the state in other spheres. The member-state has evolved as an enhanced nation-state that has access to greater resources than any political unit had in the past, with the exception of the empire. Significantly, unlike the empire, the member-state has the means to retain the loyalty of its citizenry. Further, in exchange for the constraints placed upon individual states by international regimes and the global economy, states have greater access to private goods, capital and labour, and public goods such as the free market. Cooperative efforts between states also produce enhanced capabilities and greater relative gains. The process of harmonization between states' domestic norms and rules and international norms and rules has provided domestic actors with justification to pursue what might otherwise be unpopular domestic programmes.},

One factor which is required for success of cooperatives, viz., small and homogenous group whose member enjoy a high level of equality in their socio-economic status, is found among the fishermen of Chilika. So, the success of cooperatives largely depends on their independence from the interference of government officials. Of course, cooperatives including PFCSs require constitutional protection to be an effective rural financial institution and to be an independent organisation. In short, there is need for democratising, deofficialising and depoliticising the cooperative movement.},

New institutional economics theories of contracting, agency, and property rights allocation suggest that cooperative contractors may be able to design contracts that enhance economic efficiency that IOFs cannot easily replicate. Moreover, issues of vaguely defined property rights characteristic of traditional cooperative structures (Cook) also affect the viable contractual forms, suggesting that certain producer owned and controlled organizations may have additional advantages in certain types of contracting arrangements that will be more attractive to member/producers. In this article, we focus on potential contractual design differences between IOFs, traditional marketing cooperatives, and new forms of cooperation including closed membership cooperatives. Beginning with a brief overview of the fundamental dimensions of the economics of transactions, we go on to discuss how differences in organizational structure (property rights allocations, incentives, and performance measures) affect the incentives of the contracting parties and the likely contractural design response. We conclude with a summary of testable implications that form the basis of a continued research agenda.},

For members of the cooperative, we assume decentralized decision-making behavior, i.e., Nash-Cournot behavior, (1) following a recent contribution (Albæk and Schultz). Using this approach, we consider first an open membership policy with homogeneous members and then we address the issue of heterogeneous membership. We introduce producers that are heterogeneous in terms of efficiency, and the question we address is whether more efficient producers would prefer to join a cooperative or to sell their commodity to an alternative venue, i.e., to the investor-owned firm. We believe this is an important line of research, once one recognizes that members look at different outside opportunities and market outlets when not satisfied with their returns from the cooperative.

The capacity building and empowerment of rural women through small scale agro-processing units may put aside the misnomer that women are dependent and can contribute nothing tangible to economic development. The SMCS is surely acting as a lighthouse for the welfare of those womenfolk in the country majority of whom are leading miserable life full of discrimination, indignity and drudgery. The fruit processing co-operative was found to be on a sustained growth path with constantly increasing business turnover, sales and profits.

To help them, the European Union introduced incentives for farmers to sell their produce collectively and to improve their farming processes. This article describes the work of an association of farmers and farming co-operatives, ASSOFRUIT, which has been successful in collectively marketing farm produce. The association's services include the pooling of produce to meet the requirements of large buyers such as supermarkets, directing EU subsidies to improve farm production and move into higher-value crop production, and accessing crop loans. ASSOFRUIT includes a few very large farmers who continue to market some of their produce themselves, and this is seen to benefit the association as a whole. The large farmers' knowledge about prices, market outlets and new opportunities are passed on to the association. The association's success is also attributed to the dynamism of the management team, which is always looking out for new projects for which it can secure funding.},

Results confirm the previously observed role of market structure and strongly point to a significant role for credit unions in disciplining the exercise of market power by banks. At the institution level, where the impact of bank size, market share, and holding company status can be analyzed, the evidence supports both market power and scale economy rationales for bank loan pricing and hints at a multimarket contact influence.},

	abstract = {Since the early 1980s, privately owned Savings and Credit Co-operative Societies (SACCS) have grown rapidly in Swaziland because commercial loans are either inaccessible or too costly, while public financial agencies failed to deliver the services needed by small borrowers (Matsebula, 1996). SACCS serve a wide range of clients including the poor and the self-employed as well as formal sector employees, and have shown a potential to enhance financial and economic development in the country. They provide insurance cover as well as non-exclusive starting loans to small enterprises that may eventually gain access to bigger bank loans to finance expansion. Such 'linking strategies have the potential of overcoming problems of formal banks in replicating the techniques of informal financial intermediaries as well as the lack of resources among the informal or semi-formal financial sectors which preclude them from serving their clients on a large scale' (Schoombee, 1998:354). In the linking process, semi-formal financial intermediaries may assist banks in the monitoring, supervision and recovery of loans (Sanderatne, 1992). The study utilises survey data covering a sample of six societies, and argues that the SACCS' organisational structures, operating mechanisms, staff training and regulatory and advisory assistance from the Swaziland Association of Savings and Credit Co-operative Societies are the key factors for success. The article is organised as follows. Background information on the evolution and economic significance of SACCS in Swaziland is followed by an analysis of the survey data, focusing on their outreach and financial viability. The reasons for their success and the story of one society (Asikhutulisane) are then analysed before summarising the findings.},

This paper demonstrates that such a governance rule may enhance the survival of such organizational forms in the face of adverse incentives created by accumulated financial surpluses and identifies factors that may prompt conversion to a joint-stock form. The analysis is based on noting that current members collectively have "inherited" accumulated surpluses of the cooperative from past members. Older members have an incentive to extract maximum personal private benefit from that inheritance by voting to convert from a cooperative to a joint stock company, even though such an outcome may be socially suboptimal. A simple overlapping generations model is used to develop a "sustainability constraint," which must be met if conversion is not to occur and examine how a one-member/one-vote governance rule contributes to the survival of the institution in a cooperative form.},

The study showed that whilst both cropping intensity and cultivated area decreased after transfer, the relatively high yields were sustained. The average production cost before transfer decreased by about 7% from $827/ha to $774/ha after transfer. Most importantly, average net income increased by more than 100% from $260/ha to $549/ha after transfer. Very high financial self-sufficiency ratios coupled with low running cost achieved by the farmers' co-operative led to the conclusion that transfer has resulted in better performance so far.},

	abstract = {The governments in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia considered privatization the most important prerequisite for higher efficiency in the agricultural sector. The privatization process of the former state and collective farms, thousands of hectares in size, has been implemented predominantly by way of decollectivization, restitution and compensation as well as by direct privatization following decomposition into smaller entities. This procedure, though leading to a fragmentation of ownership, has not resulted in fragmented operation here, due to the dominance of new market-conforming smaller cooperatives and other types of corporations. In addition, most new small owners leased their land to the new agricultural cooperatives, though currently the share of small-scale farming especially in Hungary is growing. These new entities, extending over hundreds of hectares, have been mostly owned by managers holding important positions already in the previous political regime and thus experienced in large-scale operation. Consequently the old-new management is able to cope with the new circumstances in the transformed farms, which are still large enough to utilize economies of scale in production. Altogether, over 90% of the agricultural land in the CEFTA is now in private hands. Other crucial reform steps related to farming were massive cuts in agrarian subsidies and the liberalization of agro-food markets and of prices as well. Although the bulk of the institutional transformation of CEFTA agriculture has been completed, problems still to be solved are constituted mainly by the lack of market institutions such as a credit system related to the land market. The urgently needed existence of the land market would generate land prices that can serve as a guideline for borrowers and lenders regarding feasible mortgage values.},

It has expanded its remit from less than 1 ha to over 50 ha of public open space within an older, high-density housing area in Greater London. The important feature of this project is the balance it manages to achieve between a number of potentially competing needs. These include the needs of local people to have a degree of control over, and be practically involved in, the improvement of their immediate environment; to have feedback in terms of aesthetic improvements; and to conserve/enhance the ecological value of the area. Failure to maintain this balance can undermine the viability of such projects. The ways in which the project has addressed ethical, aesthetic and ecological considerations are outlined, serving as an exemplar of sound community-based environmental practice for urban ecological projects elsewhere.},

	abstract = {A stated objective of the Ethiopian Government since it came to power in 1975 has been to increase the production of crops for both domestic consumption and export. Consequently, a number of plans and programs have been proposed and implemented to bring about such development in Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro review of the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land reform of 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the population growth as evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production (1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further deteriorated. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable for agriculture, but only about 19% is cultivated. This suggest an underutilisation of land. Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and education which are essential to development have not been given due attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural technologies used by farmers have changed little in this century. Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most potent economic force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from the central government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total agricultural credit, fertiliser and improved seeds respectively go directly to socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5% of the total cultivated land and 4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises with credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting smallholders, has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in Ethiopia. Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no significant development of agriculture in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform. © 1991.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  In order to assess the attitudes of fish farmers towards data management, and discover the major sources of influence upon planning production, a postal survey among 293 salmon and trout farmers was conducted in the summer of 1987. The degree of microcomputer use and the uptake of automation were examined in this perspective. Salmon and trout fanners collected production records which, in most cases, were unsuitable for planning. Microcomputers were used mainly for accounting and word processing. Software was commonly purchased‘off‐the‐shelf’. Computerization when rejected was primarily on grounds of excessive costs and time requirements. Other automation comprised feeding systems and to a lesser extent water parameter monitoring. For decision making, directors and owners relied heavily on their site managers and foremen to provide feedback. When farms were members of marketing cooperatives or owned by larger firms the latter directed their production and outlets. Accountants were employed part‐time to draw the financial accounts, and the proportion of fish farms hiring experts and computer consultants was small. The findings showed that information technology is not a priority among fish farm managers. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Because this form requires little initial capital investment (which enables local control and self-development) and can be developed in a way that allows for non-economic goals, it can be an important element of sustainable tourism. This article uses qualitative case study analysis and in-depth interviews to examine if the various rationalities within three tourism craft marketing cooperatives in central Appalachia are manifest in their contributions made to the communities in which they are located.The study is theoretically framed by the Weberian concept of formal and substantive rationality. Formal rationality is based on economic goals only, while substantive rationality allows for non-economic goals like improved quality of life and cultural preservation. Results indicate the Weberian framework is a useful device for interpreting whether a tourism-related marketing cooperative organisation's internal goals and priorities are manifest in its external contributions to community. This study is especially useful to rural tourism practitioners interested in maximising often scarce resources in a sustainable manner that maintains local control and ideologies. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

If the productivity gains from decollectivisation were due mainly to eliminating the incentive problems of collective farms, how the initial collectivisation could also have been associated with gains in productivity presents a major historical puzzle. We suggest as an answer the possibility that agricultural production in China was widely organised on a household basis until 1958, despite the collectivisation of property rights, and that the formation of the agricultural producers' co-operatives reduced the inefficiencies in factor allocation that existed following China's land reform.},

This article attempts to consider some of the theoretical and practical implications of this growing role by treating them as ‘value‐driven’ organizations, and asking how this differentiates them, in terms of efficiency and accountability, from public or private agencies. It notes the lack of developed theoretical models capable of dealing with this question, and examines the relevance of existing theories (neo‐classical economics, public administration and especially varieties of organization theory including the New Institutional Economics) in dealing with agencies which claim to be dominated by motivations based on democracy and altruism rather than self‐interest. The author looks at problems associated with the measurement of efficiency and enforcement of accountability in organizational life and at the need for effective incentives and sanctions which provide a stable basis for maintaining commitment. He then considers the issues involved in the enforcement of accountability to ensure the efficient use of resources in producer co‐operatives on the one hand and service delivery NGOs on the other. In the former, the focus is on the strengths and weaknesses of market competition and the costs of collective management; in the latter on the varied relationships between ‘principals and agents' involved in the production and management of services. © 1993 Institute of Social Studies},

Critics of producer marketing boards - the New Zealand Department of Treasury, nonfarm capitals, and one corporate agriculturalist - argue on the basis of theoretical efficiency, but offer little empirical evidence. Using insights from the family farm and cooperation literatures, we argue that cooperatives and producer marketing boards help shield family farms from the full costs of market relations, assist shareholders in capturing downstream profits, enable farmers to develop and maintain ownership of new technology, reduce competition among farmers, and allow farmers more control of their industries than would otherwise be the case.},

During the 1980s operating conditions changed as the direction of the CAP came under pressure, the GATT round proceeded, and both processors and retailers responded to the possibilities of European integration. Co-operatives will have to change both their funding methods and market strategies. Failure to do so will lead to them becoming increasingly peripheralised in the market place -from Authors},

	abstract = {Vietnam's policies to establish a market economy are reshaping the state organizations and agricultural cooperatives that have operated and maintained irrigation systems. The new policies emphasize financial autonomy for state enterprises, and a shift in the responsibilities of the agricultural cooperatives away from collective production activities. Specific policies and institutional arrangements vary considerably among the provinces. In Quang Nam-Da Nang province in central Vietnam, the agricultural cooperatives generally still play an important role in irrigation O&M at the tertiary and quaternary level, serving as intermediaries between individual households and the state enterprise that operates the headworks and the primary and secondary canal network of government irrigation schemes. The cooperatives also have full responsibility for many small pump irrigation schemes. The state irrigation enterprises have partial financial autonomy, financing their activities primarily from irrigation fees collected from the farmers. The power to set the fees, however, resides with the provincial government and not with the irrigation enterprises. The fee, which is an area-based fee differentiated by crop and season, is set in terms of paddy to facilitate maintaining its real value in the face of inflation. Both cost and equity factors are taken into consideration in setting the schedule of fees. The fees in government gravity irrigation schemes are fairly high by comparison with other Asian countries; however they are lower than typically paid by farmers in the small pump irrigation schemes operated by the agricultural cooperatives. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The results indicate that, in general, increasing either worker participation in control and/or in economic returns provides positive effects on productivity. The pattern of the different effects of employee ownership varies significantly across sectors. This new evidence strongly suggests that workers within Soviet‐type economies are responsive to economic incentives. Together with existing theoretical and empirical evidence for both Eastern and Western European firms, the findings suggest a larger role for employee ownership than typically either currently exists or that is under serious consideration in most restructuring economies.

Given the need for a sustainable steady-state economic system, some other form of business organization will likely be required that uses natural resource inputs more efficiently and is less growth oriented than the typical corporation. An attractive alternative is the producer cooperative, where employment is accompanied by a right to democratic participation in organizational governance and a share of surplus earnings. A comparative theoretical analysis of cooperative and profit-maximizing corporate behavior suggests that cooperatives will tend to use natural resource inputs more efficiently and will be less growth oriented than corporations. The limited comparative empirical research that is available supports the greater input efficiency of cooperatives relative to corporations. This same research suggests that in fully employed economies, cooperatives will be less growth oriented than corporations, although where unemployment is substantial the reverse is likely. Environmentally sustainable full employment is theoretically achievable through workweek reductions. © 1995.},

Welfare is higher with a monopoly cooperative than with a profit-maximizing monopoly, if the scope for price discrimination is small and if the world-market price is low relative to the domestic price. As the world-market price rises (or as price discrimination becomes more important), the welfare effect is reversed. The price-discrimination effect suggests that, as a marketing cooperative integrates vertically, welfare may fall. These results carry over to a duopoly with a cooperative firm and a profit-maximizing firm. In such a duopoly, the cooperative behaves more aggressively and obtains a larger market share.

The defects arise from the use of unitary boards which introduce conflicts of interest for directors and reduces both their ability and incentive to improve operational performance. The use of supervisory boards and stakeholder councils to decentralise control, provides a basis for improving the operational performance of directors and their organisation. Also, stakeholder participation provides a way to convert ‘open’ hierarchies into several decentralised ‘closed loop’ information and control systems to improve operating performance. Practical examples are found in Japanese keiretsu firms, the employee/consumer co-operatives found around the town of Mondragón in Spain and in the governance of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

All four RFIs have applied positive interest rates. All four RFIs have offered some savings services. Notable differences among the RFIs also exist. The four RFIs reviewed can be classified in two distinct groups based on average loan and deposit size, and also with respect to the targeted clientele. Hence the level of outreach achieved has differed among RFIs, as has the level of women's participation. The data indicate an extremely wide range of RFI performance in terms of administrative costs measured against the RFI's outstanding loan portfolio. -from Author},

As a result, time allocation patterns between farm work and off-farm work will vary significantly across cooperatives. Participation equations in farm work and off-farm work of farmers who are members of Israeli moshavim are estimated jointly, including a cooperative specific factor in each equation. The fixed effects are found to be significant and important, but can be only partly explained by observed cooperative attributes. This provides another support to the Monte Carlo results of Borjas and Sueyoshi, that controlling for group effects is superior to alternative models. The results also imply that unobserved factors have considerable effects on farmers' time allocation, and hence should be controlled for whenever possible.},

The study shows that Chinese women in rural areas have increasingly adopted co-operatives as a form of organization in their efforts to address the problem of their lack of access to resources, including land, credit, jobs, training and information, and to participate in the mainstream economy as an organized force. This article demonstrates that stronger institutional linkages between local offices of the All-China Women's Federation and the ICCIC encourage the growth of women's co-operative activities. It raises two sets of policy issues that are central to the development of co-operatives and women's banking: the continued growth of these activities will depend upon the government adopting legislation to define the legal framework governing co-operative relations and management systems, and establishing gender-inclusive policies to increase credit to women's income-generating activities.},

	abstract = {Since the 1970s dam construction in the rural areas of South Korea has formed a major part of government works. This has contributed greatly to the control of water resources, but has also resulted in many involuntary or forced migrations of people from inundated areas. In many studies of the villages lost to dam construction, whether undertaken by geographers, cultural anthropologists, or folklorists, the central concern has been on the ethnology of the former settlement and on the pattern of removal. Other important aspects such as the process of re-settlement, adaption and acculturation of the migrants to their new homes have so far tended to be overlooked. This paper explores the re-settlement process, adaptive strategies, and acculturation of a migrant clan in South Korea. Steward's (1955) cultural core model is applied with respect to the adaptation of migrants to their new communities. The study area is the village of Ilsun-ri in Heapyung-myun, Sunsan County, Kyungpook Province. This village was occupied by migrants from the Chonju Ryu clan in 1987, with most of them coming from several clan villages which were lost in the course of construction of the Imha Dam. Particular attention was paid in this study to villagers from Musil, a native place of the Chonju Ryu clan. Fieldwork took the form of participant observation during January and February, 1991. At that time there were 66 households in Ilsun-ri, and the population was 192. In Section II the cognative structure of the villagers is outlined, followed in Sections III-IV by an examination of villagers occupations, customs, and their adaptive mechanism to their new environment. The main features of this adaptation process can be summarized as follows: These migrants made a collective decision to move in the hope that cultural shock would be lessened and the homogeneity of the clan would be maintained. Since the family heads were mostly middle-aged, and ranked in economic terms in the 'middle-class', the group adapted well to their new milieux. Before migration the Chonju Ryu villagers depended on subsistence agriculture, using manual labour and farm animals, for their livelihood. After migration, the villagers had to cope with many changes in agricultural environment, including climate and quality of arable land. They were also introduced to farm mechanization and improved methods of transportation. It was therefore necessary to switch to production of commercial crops in order for them to remain economically self-reliant. Accordingly, the traditional pattern of labour exchange transformed into one of functional cooperation. Also, some villagers became free to seek employment at the nearby Kumi industrial complex. As a result, the life style of the villagers has become more varied after the migration. Despite these changes, the villagers were able to maintain their traditional ancestral worship practices and Confucian value system. For example, the villagers brought with them symbolic buildings and structures, such as Chongga, Sadang, and Chongja, to set up in the new village. These structures were re-erected in the same spatial arrangement as in the old village, giving full regard to the geomantic traditions of Pung-su and their positions relative to the surrounding mountains and rivers. All this can be viewed as a kind of defensive reaction to new external influences and surrounds, but it is also clear that a necessary part of the villagers adaptive strategy was affirmation of their common ancestral heritage. Finally, it is clear that while the migrants accommodated rapidly the new agricultural technologies and methods of cooperative organization, they maintained many cultural factors related to clan identity. Although the former spirit of cooperation and internal cohesion outwardly appears to have weakened in the village, the migrants have displayed an adaptive mechanism of selective acceptance of new things, while preserving much that reflects the clans identity. These conclusions suggest the Steward cultural core model, which presumes complete acculturation takes place over time, does not fit precisely with the situation described here. © 1997, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

However, as marketization processes dissolve these links, the increasing competitive pressures of the 1990s make the search for new forms of enterprise organization a priority. The shareholding cooperative system (SCS) has been proposed as a method of strengthening enterprise autonomy whilst preserving the predominance of public ownership, and of improving enterprise efficiency by tying performance to profitabilty whilst maintaining some principles of equity. In practice, the new opportunities opened up by reform are often monopolized by those already in positions of wealth and power: local governments and individual entrepreneurs. But workers and local farmers may also become more directly involved in enterprise ownership, gaining a greater say in decision-making. In these cases, the SCS resembles a multi-stakeholder cooperative in which workers, managers, local governments and local farmers negotiate around their stakes in the future of the enterprise.},

As these conditions become less and less prevalent in today's business world, a growing number of agricultural cooperatives are abandoning the traditional cooperative model. Instead, a new cooperative model is evolving: The primary and secondary processing operations are organizationally separated, increasing the cooperatives' chances for forward integration in the processing chain. The primary processing is conducted within increasingly larger cooperative societies - some of them even internationally operating. The trade between the cooperative and its members becomes more and more business-like - for example, the cooperative gets more control with the farmers' production, and the farmers get more direct, individualized ownership to the cooperative. The secondary processing is done in private limited companies, owned jointly by the agricultural cooperatives, the farmer members and external investors, and these firms' business conduct resemble that of investor-owned firms.},

The discussion suggests that even after land reform the major share of land and output will remain on a relatively small number of larger farms, and, provided appropriate market incentives exist, the expected gains in technical efficiency from a less polarized farm structure will be reinforced by other factors including labour market, credit and technical change. Productivity in Bulgarian agriculture has the capacity to increase as a result of the land reform. Thus with the same resources there could be an increase in output, relieving worries about security of food supplies. © 1993.},

One of the most telling examples of their success is their pricing.

Tourism development on the caye has created a new market for lobsters, which has motivated some fishers to harvest undersized, prereproductive lobsters to sell to local restaurants. Data from interviews and observations suggest that this local system of resource management may be threatened, because of a local market for lobsters which has emerged with the growth of tourism at Caye Caulker. These unsustainable practices, coupled with an underfunded, understaffed, and in the fishers' experience, usually uncooperative Fisheries Department makes enforcement of state-level fisheries laws next to impossible. Caye Caulker fishers face challenging questions concerning how they will practice in and perceive the fishery, which includes participation with and perception of Belize's Fishery Department.

However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies in 1989–90, Cuba's inputs of fertilizer, pesticides, and petroleum dropped by more than half Cuba responded with a dramatic shift in its agricultural development model that featured appropriate technology, alternative organization of labor, alternative planning, and environmental preservation. Cuban pest control efforts now focus on biological control and on enhanced monitoring and diagnostic techniques. Soil management emphasizes biofertilizers and vermiculture. Minimum tillage and crop rotation are frequent practices among Cuba's independent farmers, agricultural cooperatives, and state farms. The transition to low-input agriculture has decreased the exodus of people from rural areas to cities, and has lead to establishment of lab or camps with volunteer labor and long-term programs for rebuilding rural communities. To address the loss of important food imports while ensuring environmental conservation, agricultural planning now gives priority to crop rotations, city gardens, and introduction of food crops in sugar cane areas. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

	abstract = {A descriptive account of the fisheries in the lower Sondu‐Miriu River of the Lake Victoria catchment before the construction of a hydroelectric dam is presented. It can support an annual yield of 81‐5‐1081 and a catch rate of 11.4kg/ha/h. Out of the 28 species present in the river, the most abundant were Clarias gariepinus (Butchell), Schilbe mystus (L.), Synodontis afrofischeri (Hilgend), Oreochromis variabilis (Boulenger), O. leucostictus (Trewavas), and Lates niloticus (L.), Micropterus salmoides (Lacepède) and L. niloticus are a new development in the river fishery introduced respectively from the highland areas and Lake Victoria. The yield in the river has been reduced from 668t in 1959 to the current 108t and species available replaced the once abundant Barbus altianalis (Boulenger) and Labeo victorianus (Boulenger). This drastic reduction in yield can be attributed to overfishing, habitat degradation and poor management. The upstream migration of the river fishes extends as far as 10km from the Lake Victoria river‐mouth. The period of peak reproductive activity (March‐June and October‐November) coincides with the established rainy seasons in the region. The top ranking food items of the fishes are terrestrial and aquatic insects, vegetable matter, detritus, crustaceans, molluscs, fish, plankton and grit. The endemic fish stock appears to be in a depressed state, showing signs of overexploitation, and therefore careful stocking programmes to restore the fish balance would be appropriate. Fishing effort in the river should be regulated by licensing of nets and the minimum size of fish landed should be regulated through cooperative societies, clans, party elders and other social organizations.

	abstract = {The objective of this article is to examine the effects of the institutional setup on the time allocation of farmers. I investigate Israeli cooperative villages (Moshavim) that implement cooperative ideology differentially. Not working off the farm used to be part of that ideology. However, by 1981 most farm households had at least one adult member working off the farm. The fraction of off-farm workers varied considerably across cooperatives. Institutional structure can affect time-allocation decisions in several ways. First, there might be an explicit constraint or an implicit penalty on off-farm work. Second, stronger cooperatives (in the sense of having a more effective central management) may enhance the profitability of farming and, hence, indirectly induce members to work more on the farm and less off the farm. Both cooperative strength and ideological commitment are hypothesized to affect time allocation in the same way, namely, to reduce off-farm work and increase farm work. I test this hypothesis by examining the effects of cooperative attributes that proxy for these features on farmers' on-farm and off-farm labor-supply functions. This article emphasizes the effects of the institutional setup. Although it uses data on farm households in a relatively developed agricultural sector (Moshavim in Israel), the findings are perhaps more relevant to developing countries in which institutional constraints on the choices of farmers are more abundant. J. M. Guttman and N. Haruvi studied off-farm work participation rates in Moshavim and related them to the level of cooperation, using village-level variables. In contrast, in this study I explicitly model individual behavior and control for personal, family, and farm attributes. In addition, this article adds another dimension to the existing literature by estimating the off-farm labor-supply function jointly with the on-farm labor-supply function. This has been done before, mostly with respect to participation decisions. Since on-farm and off-farm labor supply are strongly negatively correlated, a joint estimation yields more efficient estimates. The institutional structure of Moshavim and its effect on time allocation are discussed in the following section. Next, I briefly review the theory of time allocation in farm households and discuss the comparative statics of the institutional structure. After that, I describe the data set, develop the empirical model, and report the estimation results. I find that in stronger and more ideologically committed cooperatives, farmers work less off the farm and more on the farm. The article concludes with a summary of the findings and their relevance.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the debate around structural adjustment and African agriculture, the history of the Tanzanian cotton sector and farming systems in the main cotton growing area of the country before reporting the results of a small survey of cultivators carried out at the end of the 1997/8 seed cotton marketing season. This survey, carried out in the fourth year of market liberalisation, covered crop sales, farming methods, marketing behaviour and perceptions of the marketing system. The survey's main findings were as follows: Firstly, while there was almost certainly a substantial production response in 1995/6 over 1994/5 (for both official production statistics and survey data reported here on shares of cultivated area under cotton in 1995/6 show a big increase on comparable material for 1994), there is no evidence that this response has been subsequently amplified as liberalisation has continued and as monetisation of cotton sales has been institutionalised. Neither official production statistics nor average shares of cultivated area under cotton or average cotton sales as reported here show an increase over the period 1995/6 to 1997/8. In fact they show a decline of production and sales in 1997/8. Secondly, while the decline in 1997/8 was mainly the result of adverse weather conditions, the underlying failure for production to grow is based on a failure to shift toward more optimal farming methods, and a significant decline in non-labour input use. The latter follows a monetisation of inputs supply. It remains to be seen if input use will also flatten out as this monetisation process becomes institutionalised. In any event, a recovery in input use seems unlikely. Thirdly, primary cooperative societies are currently retaining very sizeable seed cotton market shares, despite offering inferior prices to private traders' ones and despite having curtailed the supply of inputs on favourable terms. This is partly based on their retention of effective monopolies in certain geographical areas. But they are also surviving in areas of high competition on the basis of the loyalty of a segment of the peasantry. Their ability to retain market share seems likely to weaken as the years pass, since with credit-based input supply no longer being undertaken, loyalty will lose most of its rationale. In addition, cooperatives may experience falling purchases as a result of failures of liquidity and a further decline in price competitiveness. Fourthly, possession of land and cattle, areas under cotton cultivation, cotton sales volumes, membership of primary cooperative societies and marketing behaviour are all socially stratified along lines of oxen ownership/non-ownership. Social stratification is partly attenuated however, most notably as a result of the heterogeneous character of oxen owners as a group. The relationship between socio-economic stratification and some of the attributes discussed above is an interesting one. The group which is best off with regard to land and cattle, has the largest areas under cotton cultivation and the highest cotton sales volumes also has the highest membership of cooperatives and ostensibly the least commercially-oriented marketing behaviour. This pattern dates to the period when cooperatives were important providers of external resources and were thus subject to efforts by better-off groups to control them. Fifthly, little or no differentiation of farming methods according to the described pattern of social stratification could be detected. Apart from differences arising from the possession/non-possession of oxen themselves (i.e., concerning methods of land preparation) the rural upper strata farmed in more or less exactly the same way as the lower one. Liberalisation of marketing in Tanzanian agriculture has (re-) accelerated commodification but has not disturbed the essentially extensive forms it reverted to during the 1980s. This tendency in turn reflects not only the 'embeddedness' of certain farming systems, but - as will be explored in subsequent papers - deregulation of markets in forms which exclusively reward quantity of output and which systematically mitigate deficiencies in output quality.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the planning and city building processes in Delhi in three periods - the imperial Mughal, the imperial British and the post-Independence. In the two earlier periods, the plans followed the ideals and tastes of the ruling elites and the cities were built to meet their needs. But the cities were well adapted to the technologies of the times and patterns of social interactions among the residents. Consequently, they provided to most of their residents a living environment which was efficient, healthy and satisfying. One reason for this was that Delhi was a relatively small city and increase in population was slow. The half century since 1941 has witnessed an unprecedented increase in population which has gone up from less than 700,000 in 1941 to 8.4 million in 1991. The increase has been due partly in response to expansion of employment in public administration, trade, finance and manufacturing industries, and partly to large in-migration of displaced persons from Pakistan during 1947-48, and from other states of India throughout the period. The efforts of the public agencies - the Central Government and the Delhi Development Authority - to expand housing have been matched by those of individuals and cooperative societies. But the efforts have been focussed on providing housing to people of medium and high income groups; the housing needs of the poor have been met by rapid growth of slums and unauthorised colonies. Expansion of physical and social infrastructure has also proved inadequate to meet the demands on it. The reliance in the absence of a mass transit facility, on a miscellany of motor vehicles for movement within the city, has resulted in very high levels of air and noise pollution. The hopeful beginning with long-term planning, made with successful implementation of the first master plan 1961-81, has suffered a set back as a result of the failure of the Central Government to approve the second master plan 1981-2001. The Regional Plan 2001 for the National Capital Region, approved in 1988 by all the governments concerned, is also not being implemented. In the resulting, impasse there is unplanned growth of a giant conurbation adding to its various problems. The paper recommends revival of metropolitan and regional planning for direction of growth of the conurbation to 2010. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {The Mondragon producers cooperatives in Basque Spain represent the classic case of alternative industrial organisation. While the cooperatives received a great deal of scholarly attention during the 1970s and 1980s, relatively little has been published on recent developments at Mondragon. It is time to update the Mondragon story. In 1991, 100 cooperatives joined to become the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation. This super-structure has permitted an important degree of centralised control over member cooperatives. Yet, it has also been the source of substantial challenges, both structural and ideological, to this alternative form of industrial organisation. We appear to be witnessing the cooperatives' decline, the end of a great experiment in favour of just another capitalist enterprise. This story is important both for cooperativism in Mondragon itself and for scholars and practitioners worldwide who find in Mondragon proof than an alternative, less exploitative approach to industrial organisation is possible.},

Against the background of financial advantages, individuals may be motivated to decrease common marketing and debt repayment. These are "public goods' and their enforcement improves with moral conduct and/or organizational strength. Multi-purpose cooperatives like the Israeli moshav are characterized by financial advantages that decrease the risk of the individual farmer as a borrower. This multi-cooperative solution may particularly suit situations of crucial capital access coupled with limited individual land property rights. The basic modeling insight presented in this paper is on the use of group credit to improve the risk profile under the above circumstances.

Although they are the most important contract farmers in terms of quantity and quality of produce, they are most dependent on the management for their supply of inputs, as well as for transport, processing and marketing facilities. Little wonder that they were the farmers who formed a co-operative in the early 1980s, when deteriorating market conditions for palm oil threatened the company's continuing existence and the farmers' chances for capital accumulation. Unable to force the management to keep to the terms of the contract, the executive board of the co-operative tried to achieve a larger measure of autonomy vis-a-vis the company by creating nurseries and transport and processing facilities of its own.},

This paper analyzes how differences in incentive structure constrain the attractiveness of interest-rate speculation and other risk-taking opportunities to managers and regulators of credit unions. Despite these better incentives, robust present-value calculations establish that NCUSIF fell into economic insolvency during the mid-1980s. Besides calculating the extent of this insolvency, the paper also seeks to explain why, after NCUSIF became insolvent, it could rebuild its reserves without an explicit or implicit taxpayer bailout. Our explanation turns on cross-industry coinsurance responsibilities and the shallowness of the fund's observed insolvency relative to industry net worth. We identify forces in the decisionmaking environment tending to limit the depth and duration of unresolved insolvencies at individual credit unions. Managerial opportunities to benefit personally from taking risks that would flow through to NCUSIF are constrained by difficulties in converting a credit union to stockholder form and by the intensity of proactive monitoring of troubled credit unions by sister institutions and other private coinsurers. We conjecture that expanded use of coinsurance and private monitoring could reduce taxpayer loss exposure elsewhere in government deposit insurance systems.},

This, it is argued, creates an incompatibility between the regulatory structure and institutional for M, imposes an arbitrary constraint on coöperatives’ growth and can induce a focus upon inappropriate financial targets by credit union management. A further impediment to the survival of coöperative financial institutions can be found in the risk weights applied for capital adequacy purposes.

Our statistical and econometric analysis points to the tentative conclusion that there are major regional differences in the performance of UCCs both in terms of the quality of loans granted and overall profitability. The latter is also influenced by the quality of the loans made, and this in turn is affected by the number of directors in the UCC and the extent to which the UCC grants loans to state-owned enterprises.},

Lele's analysis of cooperative "failure' is discussed in relation to its public choice theory framework - one which is flawed when trying to understand local forms of public action. The SANASA Thrift and Credit Cooperative Societies in Sri Lanka provide empirical evidence to support the counter-argument. Since the late 1970s, SANASA's geographical spread and membership has increased dramatically. The cooperative network is one of the largest sources of rural financial services in the country. Based on fieldwork and a survey of members, data is presented to show how the Thrift and Credit Cooperatives have brought real benefits to poorer members. Significant numbers of borrowers have achieved increased incomes linked to their use of credit, and there is evidence of some graduation above the poverty line. SANASA cooperatives are notable because they have not, generally, been "captured' by local elites wishing to use them for their own interests. SANASA illustrates how purely self-interested behaviour is not axiomatic, and that there are conditions in which local forms of collective action emerge and can be sustained. The study shows the weakness in public choice theory becuse of its failure to incorporate the role of leaders as a factor in its analytical framework. In conclusion, the argument suggests that cooperatives merit renewed consideration as an organisational form which can, in some contexts, play a poverty-alleviation role. -from Authors},

This, in turn, will lead to both radical changes in the consumer movement by the year 2000, and also to a completely redefined mission for the corporate marketing function as well. Specifically, the deliberate federal policies of the 1980s which led to a "shake-out" of the small family farm units in favor of large agri-business concerns in order to reduce federal subsidies will lead, in the 1990s, to the most noted of deleterious consequences of monopolization, namely ever increasing prices and lowered quality. The authors believe that by the late 1990s the American public will perceive this state of affairs as being intolerable and it will lead them to organize "Big Consumerism", a cohesive, much strengthened version of the consumer movement of the 1980s. This movement will, among other major activities, establish consumer cooperatives as a way to control costs through the elimination of unnecessary middlemen. In addition, this new consumerism will demand a change in the ethical standards of business behavior which, in turn, will result in a reformation in the role of the "New Marketer". This "New Marketer" function will be envisioned and practiced by incumbents as informational and educational, adhering to the highest standards of truthfulness concerning the products they are attempting to market. In this regard, the role of governmental agencies will be greatly strengthened and expanded to insure that the marketing profession lives up to these highest ethical standards and practices. © 1993 Iona College.},

	abstract = {Horace Plunkett′s Irish cooperative association introduced credit cooperatives into Ireland in 1894. The Irish cooperatives were modeled on the very successful Raiffeisen credit cooperatives of rural Germany. Credit cooperatives were never successful in Ireland, in contrast to other branches of Irish cooperation. Irish bankers argued that credit cooperatives failed simply because there was no need for such an institution. Several observers, including parliamentary bodies, came to the opposite conclusion: credit was expensive for smallholders, and credit cooperatives were a potential solution to the problem. This essay argues that several features of the Irish economic and social environment undermined the cooperative′s operation. The Irish credit cooperatives never attracted as members the more prosperous locals who provided crucial monitoring and expertise in Germany. The Irish cooperative movement was also never able to develop the strong central auditing federations that supervised and certified German cooperatives. Finally, rural Irish people seemed reluctant to force their neighbors to repay loans or face adverse consequences, which undermined the monitoring and enforcement advantages that cooperatives potentially have over commercial banks. This episode illustrates both the importance of timing in institutional development and the difficulty of transplanting institutions from one social and economic context to another. © 1994 Academic Press.

This movement was affected by the coop participants, as they struggled for control, and in turn affected the national social and economic situation. The coops and the broader national coop movement are shown to be empowering of the participants. However, while some factors enhanced the possibility of empowerment, other complex interrelated factors impeded its development. Autocratic leadership was prevalent, intermingled with apprehension about leadership and fears of failure. Outside service providers, although seemingly helpful, also impeded empowerment through subtle condescension and distance. The most effective mutual exchange occurred when outsiders integrated as insiders. Lessons are drawn for service to the grassroots coop movement through "accompaniment" or processes of participant action research.},

Much of the knowledge gained from that evolution should be applicable to the developing world. Yet, one must be careful not to try to apply the Finnish model directly to developing countries that have different cultural backgrounds, government constitutions, and economic and social obligations. The Finnish experience shows that development is based on consumers' initiative. Each party should assume the duties that exist. Consumers should pay or otherwise cover the main part of the costs. The government should concentrate on policy issues, promotion, and guidance, Associations should have management responsibility, where the role of the key person, the “champion”/“prime-mover” is decisive, The private sector could supply many of the external services. External support agencies and developing countries should analyse the experiences and potential of water associations in their areas. More realistic time-frames should be allowed for development cooperation projects in the sector Consumer-managed water supply systems exist in many other developed, and even developing countries, although largely unrecognised by the authorities. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In the first part of the paper, the government can choose to support the formation of a marketing cooperative by a group of farmers, or to establish a public marketing firm. The resulting market structures will thus be a duopoly of one marketing cooperative and one private wholesaler, or a mixed duopoly including a public firm. The equilibrium outcomes of the two market arrangements are analysed and the welfare implications compared. It is shown that both consumers' surplus and total welfare are higher in a mixed duopoly with public firm than in a mixed duopoly with cooperative, which is in turn socially superior to a pure private duopoly. In the second part, agents' incentives with regard to choice of ownership structure are discussed and analysed in a two‐stage game. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Sharing expenses by the residents of localities where public flood control works are to be undertaken is indispensable for the materialization of flood control works of medium and small-sized rivers in modern times. Flood prevention cooperatives organized by inhabitants in frequently-inundated areas have played an important role in bearing the expenses allotted to localities. But some of the cooperatives could not bear their share of the expenses and flood control work failed consequently. The author analyzed the causes of failure of a flood prevention cooperative in sharing expenses and clarified the problems of local share in expenses taking the case of the Kokufu River Flood Prevention Cooperative on Sado Island. The results are as follows: The most decisive reason that the Kokufu River Flood Prevention Cooperative could not bear its allotment is the impossibility of payment by the inhabitants of the upper basin, because extremely high rates of allotment in the upper basin were decided without adjusting the conflict between upper basin residents and lower basin residents. Hence prefectural river improvement work of the Kokufu River was halfed. Futhermore the following situation contributed to default in payment. In the Kokufu River basin advanced mining techniques were applied to flood control works in the Edo Period, and these works were carried out several times in connection with the prosperity and decline of the Sado Gold Mine. Some rational features in the works, imposition and repayment system, and so on can be seen. But after the Meiji Restoration small land-ownership in the island society prescribed repayment of much of the expenses of river improvement, and work was stopped. Therefore consideration must be given to relative flood damage between the upper basin and lower basin so as not to produce outstanding inequality between the two districts when making allotment rates. Generally, in frequently-inundated areas, we can see conflict between the uper basin and lower basin. But in that case flood control work cannot be realized without adjustment of advantages and disadvantages between the two districts. Also realization of flood control work requires the intervention of the prefectural goverment with large funds. © 1992, The Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this study, the regional conditions for the formation of areas in the broiler chicken industry have been elucidated through an examination of the area formation processes. Furthermore, the general conditions in production area formation have been investigated. As for study areas, four areas were selected: the Tajima area in Hyogo and Fuji area in Shizuoka were chosen as the production areas located in the environs of metropolitan regions. While the Koyu area in Miyazaki and the northern area of Iwate were selected as case studies in the periphery. General conditions found in the study for the formation of production area in the broiler chicken industry are as follows. The first is the participation of business firms and agricultural cooperatives’ groups as an integrator in the industry, setting up processing factories through which they developed competition to secure broiler chicken raising farms. Consequently, expanding the production area spatially, the farms gradually enlarged their sizes to carry out specialized management. The second is the predominance of marginal farms on the less favored areas where the integrators moved. These marginal farms which did not have much alternative were willing to raise broiler chickens, expecting larger incomes and stable farm management. The third is the special attributes of the broiler chicken industry such as a relatively small initial investment, and the simplicity of chicken raising which enables easy participation for even an unexperienced farm household, and an assurance of relatively high income. © 1991, The Association of Japanese Geographers.

	abstract = {During the period of April to June 1995, 291 dairy farmers of 27 cooperatives in Minas Gerais were interviewed to obtain informations related to crossbreeding practices. The majority of the farmers (92.4%) had crossbred European x Zebu herds with the European fraction being between 1/32 and 3/4, and predominately Holstein-Friesian (94.7%) and Gyr (81.1%). Most of the farmers (45.8%) planned to keep the herd intermediate and 40.0% had no defined goal for breed type (European, Zebu or crossbred). Among those that intended to keep the herd intermediate, 47.3% planned to use just a single European or Zebu sire for the next five years, 42.6% planned to use crossbred sires, and 10.1% planned to use criss-cross breeding. This result is in agreement with the low frequency of farmers that use hand mating or artificial insemination (20.6%). It is concluded that due to the confusion of the farmers, the difficulties of implementing rotational crossing, and the lack of crossbred sires selected by modern methods, the continuous F, replacement system may be a practical solution to maintain the herd intermediate between European and Zebu in herds with limitations in nutrition, management, and health.},

	abstract = {The centralised management of natural resources by the government departments has alienated people at the gras roots and resulted into collapse of traditional institutions created and managed by the local people. Prior to colonial rule, amongst various institutional models being tried in India and elsewhere for sustainable management of natural resources, the tree growers' cooperatives promoted by the National tree Growers' Cooperative Federation Limited are one which are founded on democratic norms and are progressing towards self reliance and sustainability. The Tree Growers' Cooperatives Project is currently under implementation in six states of the country with the assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA). the Federation is trying to re-establish peoples' institutions in the form of cooperatives for natural resource management in a decentralised manner. The Tree growers' Cooperatives organised under the project acquire 30-40 ha of highly degraded compact patches of revenue wastelands on long lease in closer proximity of small/medium size villages in eco-fragile regions and trans-form it into a biodiversity rich resource over a period of 8-10 yr. The results so far have proved the capacity of the rural people in establishing and managing the Tree Growers' Cooperatives, developing norms for regeneration, protection and sustainable utilisation of biomass from the village commons. the members of the cooperatives have also demonstrated their cost effective managerial capacity, innovative ideas in dispute resolution, benefit sharing and techniques of soil and water conservation and plant protection. The myth that resource management, institutional development and forestry are the jobs to be performed by the people trained in management schools has been broken by the success of the tree growers' cooperatives in more than 350 villages in 14 districts of India. With past eight years of experience, emphasis is now being laid on holistic resource management, participatory planning, monitoring and evaluation and awareness for matching resources with human and livestock population. The paper deals with the process of establishment of tree growers cooperatives, socioeconomic, political and administrative factors influencing their growth and gains in terms of human and natural resource regeneration and its collective management in a sustainable manner. The paper also covers intangible benefits of the Tree Growers' Cooperatives and future scope of their interaction into the new areas of natural resource management.},

	abstract = {In recent years Japanese vegetable growers tend to employ women who work to make up crops to finished products by arranging and packing. On the other hand it is seen in the same district that the oldmen and women specialize in growing the vegetables without the help of younger men. This cannot be adequately expanded from the available statistical data. The author attended to analyse horticulture districts which have various vegetable growers, and so selected Kitano-cho, Fukuoka Prefecture as a research field. The findings about the vegetable growing groups are as follows: There are 3 types of vegetable growing farms formed from mainly farming-labor family members: (1) The vegetable growers who manage the plastic green houses under fixed structures. They employ usually women, and sell the vegetables to chiefly the agricultural cooperative. (2) The full-time farm households (except above (1) type farms) consisting of young or middle-aged men, lacking fixed green houses. (3) The powerless labor group which consists of oldmen and women. This group's farmhouses sell the vegetables to merchants instead of the agricultural cooperative. In spite of being a small district, Kitano-cho has a large vegetable output which we can measure in the statistical data. Kitano-cho stands in the fertile alluvial plain on the Chikugo River. The common explanation for the large vegetable output comes on the good soil conditions of Kitano-cho. The author points out that Kitano-cho owes the recent development of vegetable production to many employed women. They work to make up the reaped vegetables to finished products by sorting out, putting in order, packing into boxes. Most of them are 40∼60 year-old housewives whose husbands work the offices or factories. As a result, we can interpret of the employed women promoting to increase the agricultural earnings in whole Kitano-cho town. But, the author emphasizes: there may be a hidden distinction between the two sexes in the lower wages for the employed women. Though the Japanese law prohibits to make the sexual distinction any working condition, not all the women can easily find work on favorable terms. © 1995, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

The findings are supplemented by information from preliminary research by the author on a number of other cooperatives in which women were involved and from secondary sources. The research indicates that producer cooperatives for women can be successful if there are even a few women with the necessary skills and time required. Many cooperatives studied failed in part because of lack of enthusiasm of the women involved, indicating the problems the promotion of producer cooperatives involves. The paper argues that a far more wide‐ranging debate is needed about the ways in which the ideals of cooperation and empowerment can be preserved, while at the same time responding to the context in which cooperatives have to operate. There is no ‘ideal cooperative’ but a range of possible options. The varying needs of women require a participatory transformation of both state and NGO cooperative development agencies. Much greater commitment is needed to assist women in relevant ways. Copyright © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

Whilst most analyses have effectively treated credit unions as unsocial, uncontested spaces of purely economic considerations, this paper enters into the interrelational, and social space of the credit union study group. In so doing, it illustrates two interesting paradoxes at the heart of credit union study group. In so doing, it illustrates two interesting paradoxes at the heart of credit union operations. Firstly, it suggests a number of potentially exclusionary effects recent deregulatory legislation has on the demarcation of common bond boundaries. Secondly, it illustrates how common bond boundary construction initiates a purification of financial space, but argues that the act of boundary formation itself is ultimately exclusionary in nature. Awareness of such issues on the part of the credit union development community of Kingston Upon Hull is highlighted through recent changes in the city's overall credit union development strategy.},

Cooperatives would seem vulnerable to liquidity problems caused by correlated shocks to their member's fortunes. They would also seem vulnerable to fraud and mis-management and to have problems convincing the public they were safe places to invest money. The historical record shows, however, that the cooperatives overcame these problems, growing steadily in numbers and assets. The minimal government regulation to which the cooperatives were subject did little to overcome their potential weaknesses. Rather, the cooperatives devised a series of regional banks and auditing associations to which most cooperatives eventually belonged. Regional cooperative banks provided liquidity and emergency loans to member cooperatives, obviating some disadvantages of their small size. Auditing associations monitored member cooperatives and provided confidence to the public by ensuring adherence to basic standards. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

Full commercialization of the New Zealand extension service took nearly 9 yr (1986 to 1994) and 3 yr (1992 to 1995) of negotiating before it was sold to a private company. During the commercialization process, the market for paid advisors increased and many of them left the public extension service to become private agricultural consultants. Many farmers were initially unwilling to pay for consultancy services. On the other hand, implementation of advice and adoption of new technologies has been greater among farmers when advice and technology are purchased than when they are provided 'free.' Since the commercialization of publicly funded extension, farmer cooperatives and commodity boards have ben to provide 'free' or low cost services to transfer information to farmers. Educational models and goals, and client-advisor relationships have also changed as a result of user-pays. The commercialization and privatization of publicly funded agricultural extension is a relatively new process and its affect on the long-term sustainability of agriculture within a country are uncertain. Consequently, additional in-depth investigation into the process and its long-term consequences on agricultural productivity, profitability, and social well-being should be completed before initiating such a plan in the USA.},

	abstract = {The current high yields of crops, which are partly due to the use of pesticides, have provided high quality produce at a relatively low price. However, environmental and consumer pressure groups are demanding strategies for a reduction in pesticide use, while maintaining the quality and availability to which we have become accustomed. These demands have been met in part by the establishment of farmers’ co-operatives supplying produce grown to recognized organic standards, but at a higher cost and limited availability due to the smaller scale of production and higher degree of wastage from pest damage. Attention is drawn to a middle way between highly efficient practices using pesticides and less efficient, smaller scale organic farming systems. One such intermediate scheme is Integrated Pest Management (IPM); its origin, development and application are outlined and key components of any IPM scheme summarized. Major food retailers have a part to play in encouraging growers to consider such schemes, and educating customers in the value of alternatives to both conventional agricultural practices utilizing pesticides, and organic growing methods. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Discourse analysis with a focus on realizations of politeness and powerless speech style is used to study two communicative events. In the first co-operative, the chairwoman controls the meeting through the allocation of turns and topics, as well as the use of her position and its privileges to persuade others of her opinion. In this context, the use of passive voice, subjunctive forms, hedges, the choice of pronouns and address forms is of specific interest to us. In the second co-operative, an Agricultural Extension Officer present in the meeting interferes, practically taking over the task of chairing the meeting. While the chairwoman is forced to defend her position, her irritation and uncertainty are expressed in contributions that contain several characteristics of a powerless speech style. At the same time, the chairwoman's reply to the intrusion shows commitment and emphasis on a point that is crucial to her. In Meeting Two presequences, false starts, changes in the word order, hedges, direct speech, choice of tense and address forms are particularly relevant.},

	abstract = {Cooperative organizational forms such as franchising and joint venturing have long been popularamong hospitality chains. However, not all chains use cooperative organizational forms and those that do varygreatlyin theirproclivityto use them. One possible explanation for this variation is that when a chain confronts critical resource scarcities, its managers will use cooperative organization in order to build upon the resources of their partners. However a second approach, agency theory, suggests that chain managers use cooperative organization to minimize the costs of monitor ing outlet managers. Using data on 94 restaurant chains, hypotheses are tested that investigate the independent and joint efficacy of these explanations. Results show that capital and brand name are important resources affecting the choice of organizational form whereas geographic dispersion, task programmability, and asset specificity are key agency variables. Overall, perhaps the key finding is that the ability of agency theory to explain organizational form is diminished among resource scarce chains. The results, therefore, suggest that both perspectives are needed to fully explain the choice of organizational form. © 1997 THE COUNCIL ON HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND INSTITUTIONAL EDUCATION.},

The CAMPCO's headquarter is situated in Mangalore and it has the mandate to reduce fluctuations in arecanut prices and create a market condition which ensures remunerative price for the growers. Its main activities include procurement, sale and processing of arecanut and cocoa, advancement of loan and essential inputs to the members, regulation of arecanut trade and promotion of research in production, processing and marketing of arecanut. The presence and performance of a marketing co-operative like CAMPCO could exercise 'intervention effects' of various forms on the structure, conduct and performance of the marketing system. The paper makes an attempt to analyse the impacts of the CAMPCO Ltd. on the structure of arecanut market and on the growth and stability in the prices of arecanut in Karnataka. Market structure is interpreted to mean all those characteristics of the organisation of the market that seem to influence the composition, competitiveness and nature of pricing within the market. The structure of the market was studied indirectly through the behaviour of arrivals, prices, concentration and so on.},

As a result at least one out of three cultivators in Maharashtra is female; in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka between 40 and 60% of agricultural work is being done by women. Thus, rural India is witnessing an intriguing process described as "feminisation of agriculture'.

The credit union is such a device. It has an established and proven record of success in many countries but, outside of Northern Ireland, credit unions are in their infancy in the United Kingdom.

	abstract = {This paper examines the functioning and performance of a large cooperative federation in Nicaragua, concerned mainly with retailing. Set up in late 1985, in response to undersupply to smallholders, especially those in the mountainous interior, it has followed a strategy of rapid expansion. By using a federal structure which has allowed middle and junior management freedom to take the initiative, and by adopting mostly simple, appropriate, and non‐bureaucratic procedures, the federation has succeeded in mounting an impressively large operation, with over 190 shops selling a wide variety of goods. On the other hand, at the centre, sales have grown sluggishly since 1988, costs have risen, and liquidity has become a problem. Moreover, the organization has lost capital, largely through its pricing policy. These can be blamed partly on the federated structure, the lack of a medium‐term strategy, and dependency upon external donors; and partly on the trading environment of recession and uncertainty. The case study illustrates the difficulties in establishing large‐scale cooperative enterprise, and the need in the long run to realise comparative advantage.

While many analyses have blamed the ‘tragedy of the commons’ and government mismanagement for environmental destruction, this paper provides a case study of resin tapping in Honduras which formulates the hypotheses that common property regimes can be successful and that economic liberalization policies may be detrimental to community‐level resource schemes. Over half of the 6000 farmer‐resin tappers in Honduras are organized into forty‐six co‐operatives that market the tree sap, wood and other forest products. These activities combine the twin goals of community‐based forest preservation and income generation. Established legally in 1974, the tapping groups have expanded to include a variety of organizational and technical arrangements. The two co‐operatives of Villa Santa and San Juan de Ojojona demonstrate contrasting histories, ecological endowments and economic outcomes. Currently the Honduran resin tappers are facing problems over their access to forest resources, the fluctuating profitability of extractive activities and the stability of the co‐operative organization. These three issues are relevant to a variety of community‐based environmental activities, and the lessons of the Honduran experience can be applied to analyse the processes of environmental degradation and community response elsewhere in the Third World. © 1991 Institute of Social Studies},

The growing agribusiness competition is stimulating debate about the compatibility between the historical principles of cooperative principles and the economic efficiency requested for their survival. The need to achieve high quality economic performance brings about cooperative organizational patterns characterized by staff control over members, who progressively lose their autonomy of decision. The acceptance of this model is determined by two reasons: the interest in members for cooperative organizations capable of assuring them consistent returns with the development of agri-business activities; and the need to eliminate the inefficiencies created by the competition between Catholic and Communist cooperatives. The present economic crisis of many right and left cooperatives is the result of the ideological division that has influenced the cooperatives in the past and gradually drove them to be heavily dependent on political parties. -from Author},

	abstract = {Voting is a common feature of most firms. Unrestricted voting, however, can lead to unstable decision making. We find that firms make tradeoffs among collective decision making, production scale, firm structure, and voter characteristics that are consistent with efforts to economize on the costs of voting. Firm responses include agenda control, restrictions to obtain a homogeneous voting population, and limits on firm size. We consider three long‐surviving producer cooperatives, representing extreme cases of collective decision making, and find that their organization is sensitive to the costs of voting and to the employment of mechanisms to constrain those costs.

	abstract = {The failure of forestry to contribute to poverty reduction in Central America is due to public policies which inhibit its profitability. Absence of public regulation of harvesting and competing subsidies to agriculture keep forestry stumpage prices artificially low. This encourages destruction of the forest resource, which damages both the environment and the potential to reduce poverty. A comparison of Costa Rica and Honduras reveals two dissimilar approaches toward forest policy. While Costa Rica attempts to raise producer and grower stumpage prices by tax credits, soft loans and differential species fees, Honduras enforces price ceilings and uses centralized authority to control forest production and export. Both countries exhibit weaknesses in the management control cycle of programming, budgeting, implementing and evaluating their forest policies. Yet the Costa Rican approach has increased stumpage prices already, which bodes well for their forest sector. By contrast, the major beneficiary of Honduran forest policy has been COHDEFOR, the state enterprise responsible for forestry management, controlling production, and running its national system of agroforestry cooperatives. Despite greater public authority and resources than the Costa Rican forest service (DGF), the Honduran forest policy is not likely to increase producer profitability or reduce poverty in the near future.

A logistic pattern of cooperative growth is tested and found to dominate a view that the number of coops grows because of support organizations. Drawing upon an ecological model it is suggested that the factor which limits growth is the availability of management and, further, that the growth of the competing 'small-scale sector' is at the expense of the cooperative sector. Management nurtured in the cooperative sector moves into the small-scale sector. Case-study analysis using a Boolean analysis suggests that legitimate and capable management are essential to success of cooperatives particularly with technologies which generate production interdependencies. Finally, supporting evidence for the significance of management competence and interdependence in explaining performance is outlined using an augmented CobbDouglas production function framework. © 1990, Sage Publications.

As a political good its significance is unrivalled: rice policy has critical consequences for farm incomes, government largesse to the agricultural cooperatives and fanners’ support for the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). More recently Japan’s rice policy has acquired an international dimension. In 1986, rice joined the list of agricultural commodities targeted by the United States for market access; it is now one of the key items subject to agricultural trade negotiations in the GATT Uruguay Round. One of the most serious and urgent policy questions facing the Japanese administration is whether to maintain the ban on rice imports or introduce some form of partial or total liberalization of the rice market. This paper examines the forces arrayed on each side of the rice liberalization debate in Japan and ventures a prediction about the final outcome. How the government resolves this question will have wider significance for both Japan’s domestic politics and its international trade relations. © 1990 Oxford university press.},

In 1976, a project was initiated to introduce soil testing and leaf analysis as a base for working out specific fertilizer recommendations on farmer's level and as monitoring system for crop nutritional status. Three well equipped laboratories were established and surveys were carried out. In 1981, services were made available to farmers, co-operatives, farmers organizations, etc. Highly qualified field personnel is advising farmers, interpreting analytical results and working out fertilizer recommendations. Services are partially paid by the beneficiaries. During 1985–1988. service was rendered to about 22, 000 farmers. In the meantime, a program was set up to establish service laboratories throughout the country. Eleven were initiated, but still not established to serve the farmers directly. However, they help in indicating fertilizer needs of the country in general. Some universities are running analysis as services for farmers within very limited scope. Gained experience by the project is now under evaluation. A manual of methods to be used in routine analysis has been agreed upon by organizations participating in providing analytical services to farmers. Establishing a network of service laboratories is suggested. Different strategies are given and discussed.

In developing countries these two kinds of lending arrangements have a mixed record, although their difficulties reflect shortcomings in implementation rather than in the lending arrangements themselves.The article indicates that successful group lending schemes work well with groups that are homogeneous and jointly liable for defaults. The practice of denying credit to all group members in case of default is the most effective and least costly way of enforcing joint liability. Another way to encourage members to repay is to require mandatory deposits that are reimbursed only when all borrowers repay their loans.The article points out that credit cooperatives that mobilize savings deposits are less dependent on external sources and increase the borrowers' incentive to repay. The success of credit cooperatives requires training of members as well as management. Experience suggests that credit cooperatives should not expand their activities beyond financial intermediation until they develop strong institutional and managerial capabilities. © 1990 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.},
