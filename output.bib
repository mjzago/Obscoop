    abstract = {How might the structure of banking affect economic resilience? We address this question by analyzing how the organizational structures of banks and banking markets were associated with unemployment trajectories in local economies during the Great Recession. Two county-level analyses yield convergent results. Increasing branch densities of giant derivative holding banks within local economies were associated with greater surges in unemployment, weaker employment recoveries and stronger recession effects on unemployment from 2007 through 2016. Increasing branch densities of community banks and credit unions and localism in banking were associated with lower unemployment spikes, stronger recoveries and dampened crisis effects. These findings advance sociological studies of finance by providing new quantitative evidence for links between the social structures of banking and economic performance. They also confound arguments that decentralized systems of small, locally based financial institutions are inherently fragile by design, suggesting instead that alternatives to 'too-big-to-fail' banking can enhance local economies' capacities to adapt proactively, withstand crisis and sustain employment during recessions.  © The Author(s) 2021.},

    abstract = {Low maize yield and productivity are major contributors to Ethiopia's severe food insecurity and poverty. Generous efforts have been made by various stakeholders such as producers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations, to increase the country's maize yield and productivity. However, the outcome is not as expected to achieve food security and poverty reduction. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing the speed of adoption of the improved maize (BH-540) variety in the Central Gondar zone. A three-stage sampling method was used to select a total of 385 smallholder farmers. Moreover, a negative binomial regression was used to determine factors influencing the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. The negative binomial regression model revealed that the age of the household head, farm size, and membership of the cooperative were statistically significant and positively affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety, whereas distance to the nearest market and access to credit were statistically significant and inversely affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. Therefore, this study suggests that the native administration ought to organize skill division and provide short-range keeping fit packages to input suppliers, producers, traders, and development agents in each district. Moreover, supporting and strengthening the current agricultural cooperatives is advisable to strengthen farmer-to-farmer skill allotment by providing mindfulness conception, benefits, and numerous infrastructures. Furthermore, the trade and market development department should be designed to establish improved seed market institutions in each district. © 2022 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {Purpose: Despite 2016 legalization of recreational cannabis cultivation and sale in California with the passage of Proposition 64, many cannabis businesses operate without licenses. Furthermore, federal regulations disincentivize financial institutions from banking and lending to licensed cannabis businesses. The authors explore the impact of legal cannabis business activity on California financial institutions, the barriers to banking faced by cannabis businesses, and the nontraditional sources of financing used by the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a mixed methods approach. The authors utilize call data for banks and credit unions headquartered in California and state cannabis licensing data to estimate the impact of the extensive and intensive margins of licensed cannabis activity on key banking indicators using difference-and-difference and fixed effects regressions. The qualitative data come from interviews with industry stakeholders in northern California's “Emerald Triangle” and add important context. Findings: The quantitative results show economically and statistically significant impacts of licensed cannabis activity on banking indicators, suggesting both direct and spillover effects from cannabis activity to the financial sector. However, cannabis businesses report substantial barriers to accessing basic financial services and credit, leading to nontraditional financing arrangements. Practical implications: The results suggest opportunities for cannabis businesses and financial institutions if regulations are eased and important avenues for further study. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the nascent literature on cannabis economics and the literature on banking regulation and nontraditional finance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of the article is to identify current problems of strengthening the social capital of rural territorial communities in the context of administrative and territorial reform with the definition of directions for their solution. Methodology / approach. The paper uses general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis to collect, process, and systematize the results of scientific research; abstract-logical and critical analysis – to identify possible risks due to the implementation of administrative-territorial reform; statistical – for data collection and systematization; method of comparisons – to identify the compliance of the dynamics of various forms of social capital to the potential of communities; graphic – to visualize the results of the assessment of the new spatial configuration of socio-territorial communities and the dynamics of accumulation of various forms of social capital; correlation and regression analysis – to determine the impact of certain indicators of social capital development on the economy of rural communities; induction and deduction – to substantiate the main directions of social capital development of rural communities in modern conditions. Results. Restrictions on the development of social capital accumulation have been identified, which include: shadowing of interaction and low trust in social institutions, individualization of behavioral strategies, growth of economically inactive and socially vulnerable groups, and formation of networks of discriminatory relationships, spreading of norms of destructive social behavior, as well as the risks that may arise in the new spatial configuration of socio-territorial communities. It is established that the administrative-territorial reform at the local level has created certain preconditions for strengthening the potential of horizontally and vertically integrating social capital. It was found that the dynamics of territorial identification of the population of Ukraine in relation to their community is negative and indicates low social capital at the local level. The dynamics of forms of horizontally integrating social capital of rural communities, which are represented by agricultural cooperatives, farms, and inter-community cooperation, are analyzed and it is found that the potential of their development in Ukraine has not been realized yet. The necessity of implementation of systemic decisions on the development of social capital of communities to achieve the main goals of decentralization of management is proved. The main directions of the development of social capital of rural communities are substantiated taking into account modern features of their development. Originality / scientific novelty. The specifics of the formation of social capital of rural communities as small local communities are analyzed, taking into account the main determinants of influence, which include increasing territorial mobility and maintaining the asymmetry of spatial development in the direction of the center-periphery, the choice of adaptive behavioral strategies due to changes in the territorial identification of the population and the assessment of opportunities to achieve a certain level of well-being in the community. The main directions of social capital development as a prerequisite for uniting and mobilizing internal resources for rural development are substantiated based on existing problems and identified potential risks due to the reform of local self-government and territorial organization of government. Scientific and methodological bases of research on social capital at the local level in the conditions of social and economic instability are improved. Practical value / implications. The results of the study will be useful for local governments of territorial communities formed as a result of local government reform and territorial organization of government, as well as district and regional state administrations, which focus on promoting inclusive community development and self-sufficiency. © 2022, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

Peni is one of the most developed countries in Latin America as far as the cooperative sector is concerned and an attractive one as those institutions are expected to repay very much above market rates. The value of this paper lies in evaluating whether high return rates are justified by a proportionally high credit risk, or otherwise. This research describes the characteristics of the Peruvian Saving and Credit Cooperative market and highlights the safeguarding tools used to protect their associates from credit risk. The paper uses official 2007-2018 data for all 143 Pemvian cooperatives supervised by the financial authority and applies several methodologies widely accepted by academics and practitioners to assess credit risk of the whole sector, namely a production of financial ratios, analysis of the financial statements. Beaver's model. Bathory model, Z-Score. Sprmgate analysis, Logit analysis and H-Factor model. It finds that risk in the industry compares favourably to returns, so highlighting the existence of a market anomaly. Indeed, Peruvian Saving and Credit Cooperatives offer up to two-digit passive interest rates to depositors while the corresponding risk has been computed in this paper as being comparably low. The cooperatives do not display risk of bankmpt under any of the tools used for carrying out the analysis. © 2022 Universidad Complutense de Madrid. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {In this study we test whether interest organizations that are confrontational towards EU institutions are less successful than their more cooperative counterparts in obtaining funding from the European Commission (EC). The transfer of public funds to interest organizations is a key dynamic in state-civil society relationships. Research shows that organizations, especially public groups, often heavily rely on public funds to the point that, without funds, many would cease to exist. 'Don't bite the hand that feeds you' is thus a popular expression among leaders of organizations who apply for funds. Scholars document a widespread perception among group leaders that a confrontational attitude towards the state can lead to curtail of public funds. This perception is based on the assumption that state institutions use public funding to discipline confrontational interest organizations. We test this assumption using quantitative and qualitative data collected from a survey of 270 interest organizations who applied for EC funding between 2015 and 2018. Our findings suggest that, while almost half of our survey respondents feel that critical attitudes towards the EU would have negative consequences for their funding applications, empirically, confrontational and cooperative organizations have the same chances of obtaining EC grants. This finding is robust across different interest organization categories, including when non-applicants and mortality anxiety are considered in the analysis. The results add a new layer to resource dependency theory pointing at the incongruence between an organization's perception of its relationship with public institutions and the observation of that relationship.  © },

    abstract = {Although embedded in a regulatory framework, studies suggest the important role of informal (relational) mechanisms in agricultural cooperatives, mostly viewed as complements to formal mechanisms. However, the interaction between these two mechanisms remains unclear. To improve our understanding of this interaction, we investigate governance mechanisms in agricultural machinery cooperatives, especially the “Coopératives d′Utilisation de Matériel Agricole” (CUMA). Machinery cooperatives allow producers to share machinery within a legally defined structure, but the traits of these cooperatives cause to rely heavily on informal mechanisms. This paper analyses how the interaction between formal and informal mechanisms minimizes coordination and motivation problems. Based on a multiple case study approach, the paper shows that the use of informal mechanisms results from the failure of formal mechanisms to minimize opportunism among members. As a result, CUMA members will primarily resort to informal mechanisms, using formal mechanisms as a complement when needed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The supervisory change has reduced the profitability of credit institutions and tighter supervision has been implemented. The transformation of the savings co-operative system was in fact an integration that led to the disappearance of savings co-operatives by 2019. Competition in the market has been weakened, which has increased the profitability of the remaining financial institutions. The results were robust in terms of the multiple specifications and profitability ratio. © 2022 by the authors.},

The analysis of the creditworthiness of financial companies and credit unions has been carried out. It was found that, during 2020–2021, no financial institution had the highest creditworthiness; at the same time, financial companies were more capable of meeting loan obligations than credit unions. A system of quantitative and qualitative indicators has been formed using correlation and factor analysis to assess the risk of lending to the activities of financial companies and credit unions. Certain indicators are suitable for integral assessment, and, therefore, create the basis for improving the methodological approach to assessing the risk of lending to financial institutions. © 2022 The American Risk and Insurance Association.},

Although these fish products are being traded informally in West Africa, research on this topic is limited. This study builds on a multi-partner supported ‘FishTrade’ initiative in Africa to illuminate the volume and value of informal fish trade across the Ghana–Togo–Benin (GTB) borders, and the socio-demographic determinants supporting participation and profitability in this trade. We used a structured survey and focus group interviews to obtain data from women fish traders, who handle the entire fish trade in three major Ghanaian markets where ICBT activities are concentrated. Our results showed ICBT across these borders constitutes significant economic and livelihood potential, estimated at about 6000 MT in volume and US$14 million in market value per annum. Furthermore, socio-demographic factors, such as fish traders’ years of experience and membership in an unofficial market cooperative, positively influence participation and profitability, but access to market information negatively affects participation. However, geographical distance, large household size and access to micro-finance negatively affect ICBT profitability. Our findings illuminate that consumers’ purchasing power, fish taste and preference, ICBT’s economic opportunities and a shared heritage and connection significantly influence this form of trading along the GTB borders. We conclude that ICBT in these small pelagic processed fish represents untapped potential for local livelihood and highlight the need for further research on this topic. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Relying on a rich dataset of mainly farmers’ cooperatives, the study evaluates the socio-economic, ecological and governance outcomes of local cooperative production practices in two nature parks. Results indicate that local cooperatives modify traditional agricultural strategies to promote production systems that respect natural environmental processes and improve local competitive advantage. Their actions promote an inter-community network for conserving land and aquatic biodiversity, even though transitioning to organic production remains challenging for the cooperatives. The paper concludes that the adoption of organic production would distinguish nature parks from other biodiversity-rich local areas. As such, continuous and comprehensive policy actions from nature park authorities, such as dedicated training courses and financial incentives, are required to increase the adoption of organic production. © 2022, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

    abstract = {The objective of the present study was to analyze the successful fisheries business model in Chhattisgarh. Since various public and private sector are involved for fisheries development in the state directly or indirectly such as state fisheries department/colleges/Institution/Federation/Center/Company Group/ Farmer etc. The respondents were selected randomly and the pre-structured questionnaire were sent through mail or direct meeting and in case of private sectors a few entrepreneur were selected purposely following random sampling for the study. In Chhattisgarh few numbers of stakeholders are available for the supply chain management in fisheries sector. The study noticed that private sector, progressive farmers, co-operative sector and companies play a pivotal role and major contribution of fish seed production, fish production, ornamental fish and fish feed. Futhermore, State universities and college develop human resources for the sector. The fish farmers were mainly involved in fish production practices whereas the harvesting practices was carried out by Machhuara community cum retailer which is the main reason behind less producer share in consumer rupee of fish farmer. © 2022 Economic Affairs (New Delhi).

    abstract = {This paper explores the coordination of the agricultural cooperative to supermarket or E‐ commerce supply chain, under the condition of quantity loss with a mixed decay function of exponential and logistical distribution. The nature of this process is analyzed, and the corresponding demand and supply functions with single‐ and multi‐stage discount strategies are constructed, respectively, to create a working model. The optimal discount ratios for supermarkets and agricultural cooperatives in decentralized and centralized decision‐making modes coupled with single‐ and multi‐stage discounts are calculated, respectively. Finally, a universal optimal strategy is designed, which can be applied to various quantity decay scenarios and makes the discount strategy more generalized. The results show that discounts can coordinate supply chains more effectively; not only would fresh agricultural produce be sold out before it starts to rot, but also the benefit conflicts arising from both supermarkets vs. cooperatives and traditional vs. E‐commerce channels could be equilibrated. Further, multi‐stage discounts are more difficult to coordinate than single‐stage ones, the corresponding optimal discount ratios rely on the initial quantity of fresh agricultural produce in the supply chain, its market share in the traditional distribution channel, the potential market size, retail price, the price sensitivity coefficient of the channel, the cross‐elasticity coefficient of prices between different channels, and the properties of the quantity loss. It is concluded that, re-gardless of what kind of quantity and quality loss occurs, whether decentralized or centralized decision making is selected, or whether the supermarket’s or agricultural cooperative’s discount ratio is considered, a universal price discount consisting of a fixed term and a drift term could both max-imize supply chain profit and coordinate this dual‐channel supply chain. © 2022 by the author.

    abstract = {This study investigated the effects of voluntary cooperativisationas conducted by the Community-Based Dairy Veterinary Foundation (CDVF) on the livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers. An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80%) and high gains (50.20%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers’ improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

    abstract = {The paper examined adaptation strategies used by rice processors in Ebonyi State to manage climate risks. The paper used random sampling technique to select respondents and questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents. Cross-sectional data collected from 98 rice processors were analysed using descriptive statistics and multivariate probit regression model. The results indicated that majority of the rice processors perceived prolonged dry season and increased rainfall intensity as the main climate risks in the state. Livelihood diversification, storing of paddy, and reliance on climate information were the major adaptation strategies used by the rice processors to manage the climate risks. The main determinants of climate change adaptation strategies of rice processors were education, membership of cooperative societies, income, training on rice processing and climate risk management, experience of climate hazards, and ownership of assets. The processors faced various barriers to adoption which are mainly related to capital needs, competition from foreign brands, access to basic infrastructure and roads and information, high cost of labour. It is recommended that government support be given to the rice producing communities in terms of basic infrastructure and policies to protect the industry. Also, regular workshops/trainings should be held to train processors on best climate risk management practices and encourage registration of processor cooperatives/relevant associations. © 2022 Robert Ugochukwu Onyeneke et al., published by Sciendo.},

The three stages of the analysis used are Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Tobit Regression and Logistic Regression. Based on the results of the analysis using the DEA method, it is concluded that the average performance that can be achieved by SACCOs with existing technology is 65 % of the maximum potential yield. There are 61.3 % of SACCOs which are declared technically inefficient. The factors that influence the level of technical efficiency of Saving and Credit Cooperatives are interest, loan term, manager's age, and type of business. Furthermore, the factors that affect the health of the cooperative based on logistics analysis are the variable frequency of management meetings, age of the cooperative, fixed deposits and average loan. This study supports the SACCOs in becoming more efficient and healthy with the influence of external policy (from government) and internal policy (from SACCOs). © 2022 The Authors},

    abstract = {The purpose of the study was to establish the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for the primary Agricultural Marketing Co-operatives Societies (AMCOS) at Rombo District in Tanzania. Specifically, the study aimed to establish factors that members perceive to be critical to their success, and to assess their contribution to the AMCOS performance. The study identified factors through intensive literature review, then refining them before testing them through survey to members and employed survey by distributing 334 questionnaires to members to the AMCOS that have the autonomy to do business directly without dependingon their umbrella institutions. Qualitative data were also used in order to validate the quantitative data. Data from survey were analysed by factor analysis in order to have factors which were mostly accepted by the AMCOS members. After categorising the factors obtained from the factor analysis, regression analysis was conducted to assess their influence on the performance. Qualitative data were analysed using content Analysis by the help of ATLAS Software. The study established Eleven (11) CSFs that were categorised into: commitment (use of personal skills, members’ control and promotion), governance (measurement system, governance structure, leadership support, and transparency), strategy (self-evaluation, objective development, strategy focused, living the vision of the institution). The study found the CSFs to have positive significant influence on the primary AMCOS performance. The study concludes that members of the primary AMCOS do have their common factors which they believe to be key for the success of their institutions, that affect positively the performance of their cooperatives. The study recommends that, the CSFs suggested by the members should be given priority in any decision that is intended to affect the cooperatives that can be easily translated according to their expectations to have strong institutions. © 2022 The Author(s).

The Vinča culture in Neolithic Old Europe is one more documented peaceful and egalitarian cooperative society in history. Vinča was the largest inhabited settlement in Old Europe and the entire Neolithic culture was named after it. The successful trade in Neolithic Europe was probably motivated by the spiritual components of the value of the goddess figurine products. The author argues that along with trade and agriculture, the main driver of the development of Neolithic society and Vinča culture was the authentic type of leadership. There was no privileged position or distinct status for leaders. The leadership was based on responsibilities, the leader was responsible to put the acquired knowledge in the service of the development of the whole community. Undoubtedly, the leadership expressed in the Vinča culture is one of the main reasons for its peaceful progress. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {Board of directors are important elements in the structure and management of cooperatives. This study examines the relationships between cooperative board diversity (i.e., value and functional) and three performance variables (social performance, operational performance, and democratic performance). Additionally, we hypothesize that conflict (task or relational) mediates these relationships. We argue that decision making, policy, and performance depend on the composition of a board. The empirical analysis, using a sample of 423 female board members in 66 local consumer cooperatives in South Korea, finds that board value diversity can have a negative effect on performance, even though their functional background diversity may be positive, while conflicts over performing tasks may mediate functional background diversity and performance. More specifically, the results indicate that board value diversity is positive and significantly related to relational conflicts, while functional background diversity is negative and significantly related to task conflicts. The findings suggest that performance of cooperatives can be improved with more diverse board with functional backgrounds. We hope that this paper could offer a significant contribution to both the board and corporate governance literature and the diversity literature. © The authors, 2022.},

    abstract = {The default of a cooperative has significant implications on cooperative members and the agricultural supply chain. Therefore, monitoring and even predicting future changes in creditworthiness is of value to cooperative managers and their lenders. However, we know little about farmer cooperatives' credit profiles and behavior because their financial statements are seldom shared. Using a Moody's credit rating model and a unique data set, this article estimates Markov chains to evaluate changes in farmer cooperatives’ credit quality. The unconditional (one-size-fits-all) probability matrix, as is typically estimated, is shown to not be appropriate in describing credit rating transitions. Results also show cooperatives do not exhibit rating change momentum since a downgrade is not likely to be followed by another downgrade in the next period. Credit ratings of farmer cooperatives with less than $20 million in net sales follow a first-order Markov chain with stationary probabilities and the cooperatives with net sales of more than $250 million follow a zero-order Markov chain. This article adds to the limited research available on the credit rating behavior of farmer cooperatives. Cooperative managers, directors, and lenders can utilize these findings to make more informed decisions to impact future credit ratings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This article reports on the recent experiences of joint cropland management (JCM) in Spain. These initiatives are based on the grouping of plots to achieve different objectives through social and organisational innovation. JCM involves three types of actor: landowners, cooperatives and the people who cultivate the land, who may or may not be landowners or members of the cooperative. Implementation of this strategy, which is being adopted by an increasing number of agri-food marketing cooperatives, requires substantial social capital. Therefore, collaboration between public and private actors is needed to generate and transfer knowledge on these initiatives. The Operational Group on Social Innovation in Land Management (GO_InnoLand) was created in 2020 to support JCM processes, which help young farmers who are setting up in the agricultural sector. JCM initiatives could be one way to prevent the abandonment of small-scale land plots and drive the demographic challenge. Public policies can support this strategy by enhancing social and organisational innovation, facilitating financial instruments, providing technical assistance, improving collaboration networks and linking landholders with new professionals. © 2022 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists.},

    abstract = {The partnerships between agricultural cooperatives and development actors play a critical role in meeting development challenges and building cooperative sustainability. The objective of this study was to analyze the key characteristics of engagements established between agricultural cooperatives and other actors and determine their success level. An analytical framework was developed to highlight nine areas, namely partnership configuration, stakeholders, objectives of the partnerships, partnership types, partnership stages, communication methods, achieved outcomes, partnership evaluation, and partnership sustainability. The targets were all agricultural cooperatives building associations with other actors between 2016 and 2020 in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the study covered 69 partnerships founded by 32 agricultural cooperatives. The results revealed that the cooperatives involved in partnerships essentially provide farming inputs and equipment for their stakeholders and capacity building and training purposes. The public sector was the leading actor that collaborated with agricultural cooperatives in inter-sector partnerships. The findings also showed that 55.1% of the partnerships were "strategic partnerships"in cases of both independent value formation and integrative partnerships. By focusing on mapping the partnerships, this study presents beneficial information for policy-makers working on how agricultural cooperatives dealt with the other actors and the lessons gathered to build future sustainability collaborations.  © 2022 Alotaibi, Kassem.

Theoretical framework – Miles and Snow’s strategic behavior model and Simons’ management control systems model (1995). Design/methodology/approach – A survey was carried out of 100 managers of agribusiness cooperatives in the dairy sector in the southern region of Brazil. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was applied to the data collected. Findings – The results partially confirmed the propositions established in the study. Different combinations of belief systems, limits, diagnostic control, and interactive control were observed depending on whether the cooperative adopted defender or prospector strategic behaviors. Control of the cooperative’s strategy is achieved by combining the MCSs, since their strength lies in their joint use and their complementarity. Practical & social implications of research – The combined use of rigid and flexible controls allows agro-industrial cooperatives to simultaneously target operational efficiency and the pursuit of innovation. Originality/value – By demonstrating that not all MCSs are individually relevant to different strategic behaviors, with evidence of equifinality in MCS combinations, the study provides an original contribution. © FECAP.},

    abstract = {The recently emerged Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has affected all sections of human society including agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and industry. In this research, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 on Iran’s livestock and meat market by using an equilibrium displacement model. The prevalence of the Coronavirus has had the greatest economic effects on rising exchange rates and has reduced exports in Iran. The results also show that the factors of the Coronavirus (exchange rate and exports) have the highest effect on Iran’s meat market. The rising exchange rates and reduced exports lead to higher prices and lower quantities in the meat market, which increase the suppliers’ welfare at the retail and farm levels. These results show the negative effect of the outbreak of Coronavirus. Corona outbreak increases price at the farm and retail level, therefore, farm and retail quantities fall. Since the impact of an increase in the price is much greater than the effect of reducing production, producer surplus increases. A policy conclusion of this research is that the current situation in Iran is difficult for the poultry and livestock industry because of the need for foreign currency and the abuse of market power in the distribution system. Farmer cooperatives can overcome these problems because their objectives are to serve farmers and their goals align with farmers goals. © 2022, Tarbiat Modares University. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Anthropologists and sociologists alike have long observed two generic types of human society-big man and chief-across indigenous tribes around the globe, but they are not in agreement on how and through what mechanisms they adapt to modern economic life. Drawing upon qualitative and statistical analysis, this study examines the establishment of credit unions across indigenous villages in Taiwan, where both of these traditional authority structures are present. The analysis shows that villages characterized by ascribed power and inherited hierarchy (chief villages) provide less structural support for the founding and operation of credit unions and are less likely to adopt credit unions than communities whose leadership is determined by individual merits and achievement (big man villages). This finding suggests that existing authority structures in these traditional societies constrain incentive schemes and trust structures critical to the founding and persistence of new economic organizations. © 2022 Editions Ophrys.

    abstract = {The development of agricultural cooperation in Ukraine is one of the main vectors for rapid recovery of agricultural production after the Russian-Ukrainian war, increasing its competitiveness, ensuring sustainable development of rural areas, increasing employment and welfare of rural population. However, agricultural service cooperatives are not developed in Ukraine. The purpose of this study was to find the main drivers of agricultural service cooperatives’ development in Ukraine, to outline on this basis promising directions for development of agricultural policy in terms of stimulating their development as a counterweight to the dominance of agricultural holdings. It is proven that the main restraining factor in the development of agricultural service cooperatives in Ukraine is institutional memory of a peasant, which was formed during collectivization in Soviet times and which in modern conditions is associated with the concept of “cooperative”. This creates opposition from agricultural producers towards the national policy on the development of agricultural cooperatives, which meet international cooperative principles, and which have proven their advantages in increasing competitiveness of farmers on the example of developed countries of the world. It is emphasized that before changing formal institutions through legislation, it is necessary to form proper informal institutions that will strengthen, and not oppose, the introduction of formal ones. This paper is of practical importance for scientists and representatives of public administration in the field of forming strategic state and regional programs for agricultural development. Compliance of national policy measures according to the identified drivers of agricultural service cooperation’ development, requires further research. Copyright © The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Sustainable forest management is the key to biodiversity conservation, flow of resources and climate change mitigation. We assessed the impact of various forest management regimes (FMRs): legal felling series [(reserve forest (RF), demarcated protected forest (DPF), un-demarcated protected forest (UPF), co-operative society forest (CSF) and un-classed forest (UF)] on biodiversity conservations and carbon storage in Acacia catechu Willd. Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in Nurpur Forest Division of north-western Himalaya, India. The study revealed significant variations in floristic composition, biodiversity indices, population structure and C storage potential among different forest management regimes. The RF and DPF were found to be rich in species diversity and richness whereas the Simpson dominance index for trees and shrubs was maximum in UF and UPF, respectively. The diversity of understory herbs were higher in CSF and UF. The maximum density of seedlings, saplings and poles were recorded in RF followed by DPF and UPF, whereas the minimum density was found in CSF. The tree C density (69.15 Mg C ha−1) was maximum in UF closely followed by RF; whereas the minimum was recorded in CSF (33.27 Mg C ha−1). The soil C density was maximum in RF (115.49 Mg C ha−1) and minimum in CSF (90.28 Mg C ha−1). Similarly, the maximum total ecosystem C density was recorded in RF (183.52 Mg C ha−1) followed by DPF (166.61 Mg C ha−1) and minimum in CSF (126.05 Mg C ha−1). Overall, UF management regimes were shown to have a greater capacity for C storage in vegetation, whereas strict FMRs, such as RF and DPF, were found to be more diverse and have a higher soil and ecosystem carbon density. The study established that in the midst of climate and biodiversity emergencies, it is urgent to maintain, protect and strengthen the network of RF and DPF FMRs for biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation and mitigation.

    abstract = {Do income shocks affect educational investment? Can self-help groups or Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) mitigate the impact of shocks on educational investment? Using nationally representative panel data from Tanzania, I find that educational investment suffers because of income shocks. On a whole, I find that income shock is negatively correlated with educational investment measured in per school-age child educational expenditure. However, I find no strong evidence to suggest that self-help groups and SACCOs buffer against income shocks. This suggests that locally available buffering mechanisms such as self-help groups and SACCOs do not necessarily help households to cushion against income shocks partly because many of the shocks affect most people in a given locality. Therefore, relying solely on the local mitigating mechanisms may not be a good option. This calls for a need to design policies that would enable households to insure themselves beyond their local insurance mechanisms. Public insurance and social safety nets programs may help households to overcome income shocks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Institute for Social and Economic Change.},

Hence, this study intends to investigate the association between audit committee attributes namely audit committee expertise and experience, audit committee meeting frequency and audit committee size to the timeliness reporting compliance among Malaysian cooperative societies. Using qualitative research methods, 158 usable questionnaires from 59 cooperative societies were successfully gathered and analysed using SmartPLS 3 Version 3.2.8. The results obtained provided support to the notion that there is a significant positive relationship between the frequency of meetings on the timeliness reporting compliance and a significant positive relationship between audit committee size on the timeliness reporting compliance. However, the notion expecting a significant positive relationship between the expertise of the audit committee on the timeliness reporting compliance proved to be insignificant. Conclusively, the study provides theoretical and practical support to both literature and practitioners on the importance of having optimum audit committee size and high frequency of meeting in ensuring the timeliness compliance of financial reporting of cooperative societies. © 2022, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw.

Using cross-sectional data collected from 37 cooperatives, this paper analyses the factors influencing the success of donor supported agricultural cooperatives by ordinal logistic regression model. The results indicate that new groups are rather small but homogeneous. Members agreed that more non-economic, rather than economic, benefits are currently derived from collective action. Determinants of success include the size of the cooperative, the proportion of women in the cooperative, the proportion of nuclear families, active participation in the cooperative and the type of product cultivated. However, the results are conditioned by respective value chain and influenced by the strategies of non-governmental organizations during the establishment of cooperatives. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

    abstract = {The aim of this article was to investigate the effects of informal controls on psychological empowerment and job satisfaction. Despite previous studies having analyzed the role of certain management control systems in individual results, such as psychological empowerment and job satisfaction, the evidence on informal controls within this context is inconclusive. Credit union systems play a considerable role in economic growth, regional development, and employability. We therefore explore the perception of directors and managers of business units of one of the biggest cooperative systems regarding the informal controls used. Considering that job satisfaction has a series of implications for organizations (for example in employee loyalty and job performance), it is important to understand its determinants. The literature points to the growing concern among contemporary organizations about informal controls. Various studies focus on understanding the role of these controls and their respective effects on organizational and individual behaviors. From the individual perspective, there is a need to analyze the indirect effects of management controls on individual aspects by means of psychological variables. Thus, this study provides new evidence on informal controls in organizations by exploring the intervening role of psychological empowerment and the (beneficial) effects on job satisfaction. In addition, the study provides a methodological contribution to the national research on management control by adding an analysis based on mixed methods. A survey was applied to directors and managers of business units of one of the biggest credit union systems in Brazil. The data were analyzed using a mixed methods approach: Partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Informal controls are directly and indirectly associated (via empowerment) with job satisfaction. Moreover, the findings indicate more than one solution for high job satisfaction. © 2022 Universidade de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Governments and donors often promote farmer organizations (FOs) in the implementation of their agricultural development programs. Yet, there is a lot of uncertainty whether externally supported FOs provide benefits beyond the channelling of programs. This paper uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and representative data from 4,074 Zambian households to estimate FO impacts on members, with and without controlling for a national input-subsidy program. The results show that Zambian FOs tend to attract better-educated households with larger farm sizes, but can lead to female integration when external subsidies are involved. FOs also have a significantly positive effect on members’ farm performance, irrespective of whether members receive input subsidies, while the presence of the external program leads to an unequal distribution of benefits within the FOs: positive impacts on farm performance are, on average 13–44% lower amongst members who do not benefit from the Zambian government program. Overall, these findings imply that Zambian FOs seem to provide benefits that go beyond the intention of the subsidy-program, which can be used to promote women empowerment and smallholder farm performance. The findings also demonstrate, however, that governments need to carefully design their programs to not reinforce inequality amongst farmer organizations and their members. © 2021 The Authors.

To reduce the uncertainties related to IT project priority setting, we proposed a model based on a hybrid multicriteria method composed by the best–worst method to establish the weights of the criteria and fuzzy-TOPSIS to define the project ranking. The model allows us (1) to define strategic subcriteria, (2) adjust the weights according to the company's reality, (3) to deal with the uncertainties of the evaluations of the decision makers, and (4) provide the project ranking that translates reality into the distribution of resources in the IT sector. Finally, we applied the model to a case study in the IT sector of a Brazilian agroindustrial cooperative. For the managers, the method provides a precise decision aiding tool. Although the model has been applied to the prioritization of IT projects in a cooperative, the same can be generalized to the IT sectors of other companies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

    abstract = {Farmer-controlled cooperatives contribute significantly to the growth of the rice sector in the Philippines, the country’s most important agricultural sector. Despite ongoing financial support from various government agencies, many of the country’s rice cooperatives struggle to remain viable. Cooperative failure is often attributed to poor management, inadequate capital, and opportunistic side selling by members. However, a growing body of literature views these problems as symptoms of much more fundamental flaws in the institutional arrangements that characterize traditional cooperatives. Relationships between indicators of financial performance and institutional attributes observed in case studies of four Philippine rice farmer cooperatives were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of this analysis were interpreted against causal relationships predicted by the New Institutional Economics theory. Financial performance improves when cooperatives require their members to invest in proportion to their patronage, allow members to adjust their shareholding, and periodically redeem members’ shares. Other performance-enhancing institutional arrangements could be adopted if the Philippine Cooperative Code authorized directors to issue class B shares. The findings also highlight operational and governance practices that improve financial performance, which directors can and should apply. © 2022, Asian Economic and Social Society.

We investigate how incentive payments can reduce the problem of free riders and improve these cooperatives’ reputation. Using a quantile regression method, while controlling for the potential endogeneity of incentive payments, we show that quality-based compensation can rule out cooperative members’ defrauding options. This remuneration has a non-linear positive effect on small cooperatives’ performances.

The LVI result suggests the need for the government to consider raising the priority on households in Can Tho province through adaptation support to improve the resilience and adaptive capacity, especially by enhancing the social network in this area to stimulate support from local authorities and farmer groups. The regression results imply that extension services should provide adequate and timely weather information to equip the farmers to be more prepared for climatic shocks. Moreover, credit facilities with low interest rates should be made available, especially to those who are members of agricultural cooperatives. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

    abstract = {Banana is an essential commercial fruit for smallholder farmers in East Africa including Ethiopia. It is also lifeblood of the majority of the farmers in Arba Minch district of Ethiopia. However, this sector is experiencing many constraints with limited investment on sustainable value chain management. Thus, this study aims to examine the sustainability performance assessment of the banana value chain by comparing and analyzing 25 attributes through triple bottom-line indicators. The critical aspects of the qualitative data were analyzed using Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems version 3.0 at Ethiopian context. The results show that banana product flow from the farmer and ends with the consumer through three market channels which link farmers directly with rural retailers, traveling traders, and farmer cooperatives. Largest volume of banana was sold through the traveling trader channel while the smallest volume was sold via the rural retailer channels. The banana payment flow begins from consumers and ends with input suppliers. Farmers have limited access to alternative markets for their banana products, but wholesalers have many connections and marketing options across the country. The results of the banana value chain sustainability assessment also reveal that the economic, social, and environmental indicators have moderate sustainability performance in the study area. The value of the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.7993 which shows that the five-point scale items of the experts’ judgment on the sustainability of banana value chain are consistent and reliable. The chain has several advantages in terms of profitability, emission of air pollutants, employment, and constraints in terms of coordination, profit margin, value share, market diversity, transportation, product and market information, safety and hygiene, and waste management. Thus, Government and non-governmental organizations give due attention towards the sustainable banana value chain. © 2022 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {Problem Definition: With increasing concerns about the quality and safety of agricultural products, many agricultural cooperatives (co-ops) have begun to specify quality provisions in contracts with farmers. Correspondingly, they are pooling products to quality-differentiated markets and offering quality-differentiated prices to farmers in multiple stages. Methodology/results: We propose a two-stage stochastic program to study the quality coordination problem in a setting where a co-op specifies a quality standard and offers a multistage payment scheme in its contract with multiple farmers who can exert quality-related effort and also show preference toward prompt payment timing. We first analyze a commonly adopted payment scheme, the pooling payment scheme, and then propose an improved payment scheme, the upfront incentive (UI) payment scheme. We find that the pooling payment scheme is able to coordinate the supply chain only when farmers’ time preference is higher than a threshold; otherwise, the scheme leads to the problem of over-motivation with respect to effort. However, the UI payment scheme can coordinate the supply chain unconditionally and is also robust to farmers heterogeneous in farm size. We further conduct two extensions, including farmers heterogeneous in farm size and dynamic market size. Managerial implications: The results provide guidance on a co-op’s contract design, including quality provision and payment mechanisms in multiple periods. © 2022 INFORMS.},

    abstract = {Generally, agricultural production involves several challenges. In the drylands, it is further complicated by weather-related risks and resource degradation. In this paper, we present a case study of the mixed crop-livestock production system in Jordan. To better capture the nature of response farming in the drylands, we develop a methodology for using crop simulation models to directly generate data for optimizing production practices of an integrated crop-livestock producing household in a dynamic stochastic context. The approach optimizes producer’s adaptations to random events, such as weather, which are realized throughout the planning horizon. To ensure the sustainability of the optimized production decisions, long-term valuations of end of horizon soil attributes are included in the objective function. This approach endogenizes the tradeoff between short-and long-run productivity. Model results show that due to the limited natural resource endowments and financial liquidity constraints of the typical farm households in the study area, we find these households have limited options. To optimally respond to weather conditions during the production season, better manage risk, and achieve improvements in soil attributes, a typical household would need larger farm size, larger flock, and better financial liquidity than it currently commands. Like all such models, the farm household model used in this paper is not suitable for drawing policy implications. Therefore, targeted analysis using appropriate sectoral or economy-wide models will be needed in the future to identify and test the efficacy of different policy and institutional interventions including land consolidation, establishment of producer and marketing cooperatives, access to financial services including agricultural credit, and crop insurance in expanding the resource base of farmers—thereby positioning them for higher earnings, ensuring soil conservation, and enhancing the sustainability of the production system.

    abstract = {Farmers’ cooperatives play an important role in enabling small farmers to integrate into modern agriculture. Based on the survey data of 7200 farmers in four provinces of China, this paper uses the multi-dimensional poverty measurement method and the instrumental variable method to reveal the transmission mechanism and multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect of farmers’ cooperatives in deep poverty-stricken areas in China to realize joint agricultural empowerment through the supply chain. The results show that farmers’ cooperatives play an important role in enhancing small farmers’ financing, technology application, market sales, and rights decision-making. Every increase in the degree of interest connection between the two will help farmers reduce the multi-dimensional poverty level by 12.3%, and the mitigation effects on material poverty, ability poverty, and rights poverty are between 10% and 13%. Compared with agricultural cooperatives with weak organizational service capacity, cooperatives with high organizational service capacity have a more significant multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect on farmers, which leads to farmers obtaining financing and improving their ability and income. In addition, the difference in benefit coupling between agricultural cooperatives and farmers of different leading bodies also results in the heterogeneity of multi-dimensional poverty alleviation effects of farmers. To a certain extent, the supply chain is affected by the risk endowment of members, the supply chain’s poverty alleviation performance is affected by members’ supply chain’s poverty alleviation performance, and there is a certain risk transfer and “distribution failure”. Therefore, optimizing the benefit coupling structure and risk sharing mechanism between farmers’ cooperatives and farmers has become an important way to break the pattern of “the strong are always strong” and “distribution failure” for supply chain members and farmers. © 2022 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate if access to local branch infrastructure of the farm credit system institutions (FCS), banks and credit unions (BCU), and alternative financial services (AFS) providers is related to the use of credit from non-traditional lenders (NTLs). The focus is on beginning and women operators who are typically credit constrained and thus more likely to suffer from closures of bank branches and consolidation of traditional agricultural lenders. Design/methodology/approach: Informed by Detragiache et al. (2000), the authors specify farmers’ use of loans as a function of their access to credit (measured by the branch density of each lender type) along with operator’s and operation’s controls. The measures of loans by NTLs (number, use, share and lender type) require the use of Poisson, Probit, Tobit and Multinomial Logit techniques. This study utilizes individual producer data from the 2018 Agricultural Resource Management Survey and 2018 county-level branch density data for FCS, BCU and AFS providers. Findings: Access to credit from FCS is helpful to BFRs only, while access to AFS is associated with the use of loans from NTLs by women but not by BFRs. As expected, access to BCU credit matters for the use of loans from NTLs, with a complementary effect for BFRs but a substitution effect for women’s use of such loans. Originality/value: There are no studies on local agricultural credit markets in the US that evaluate the implications from changes in access to credit on credit-constrained borrowers and their use of NTLs’ credit. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper builds an evaluation model of rural development pressure and left-behind to analyze the spatial differences and characteristics of rural development pressure and the “three-stay” problem in Jinchang City, Hexi Corridor, China, in 2019. Then, we explored the relationship between them. The conclusions are: (1) Jinchang City has the lowest pressure on infrastructure and the largest pressure on industrial development, with significant spatial differences in comprehensive pressure. (2) Jinchang City is dominated by double pressure villages (40.60%) and comprehensive pressure villages (38.35%). Single-pressure villages (19.55%) and non-pressure villages (1.50%) account for relatively small proportions. (3) The population of “three-stay” in Jinchang City is 1,642, accounting for 1.19% of the total rural population. The middle and low-level left-behind areas have the largest number, accounting for 76.69% of the total administrative villages. The types of left-behind villages are mainly dominated by left-behind children and left-behind elderly people, accounting for 71.72% of the total number of left-behind villages. (4) Homestead per household, the rate of network coverage, per capita cultivated land area, and the number of specialized farmer cooperatives owned are the main factors affecting different types of left-behind villages, and each factor has different effects on different types of left-behind villages. This paper can provide a theoretical basis for implementing the rural revitalization strategy and scientifically solving the rural “three-stay” problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The credit-reporting platform promises to produce new and valuable knowledge about borrowers' creditworthiness and risk. But valuable in what ways and for whom? Private credit bureaus rely on vast arrays of personal and financial data in order to produce credit reports and consumer credit scores that claim to represent the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. Cooperative loan officers, instead, understand creditworthiness to be highly variable and rely on relational metrics in order to determine risk as well as carefully overseeing existing loans to ensure their timely repayment. Based on ethnographic fieldwork with loan officers at a small-scale credit cooperative in Lomé, Togo, this article examines how the impending arrival of a private credit bureau and new credit-reporting technologies highlights the distinction between the ways in which credit bureaus and loan officers understand the nature of financial risk, as well as the centrality of loan officers and their management of borrower debt in sustaining the field of small-scale lending in Togo.  © },

    abstract = {Biopesticides have been recognized as viable alternatives to chemical pesticides in controlling agricultural pests for plants and reducing harmful chemical residues. However, small and marginal farmers are facing challenges while adopting biopesticides, namely, high cost and complicated application techniques, resulting in a low level of farmer acceptance. Accordingly, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), voluntarily formed by farmers, develop mutual technical assistance among their members to solve the technical problems of biopesticide adoption. This study assumes that as a new form of farmer cooperative, FPOs have the potential to promote biopesticide adoption through the implementation of collective pesticide adoption (CPA). Along this line, this paper uses a cooperative game-based hybrid method to develop an incentive mechanism of biopesticide adoption for FPOs to implement CPAs. First, we construct a CPA decision model for mixed pesticides (i.e., biopesticides and chemical pesticides) based on multichoice goal programming (MCGP) to compromise the conflicting objectives regarding cost efficiency and chemical residue reduction, thereby obtaining the optimal total cost of pesticide adoption. Second, recognizing the optimal total adoption cost as a baseline, we devise a cooperative game-based cost allocation scheme to maintain farmers' voluntary participation in FPOs. This study demonstrates that the CPA implemented based on our proposed models can at least match if not surpass the economic and environmental performance of farmers' independent pesticide adoption (IPA). We further demonstrate that the proposed cooperative game solution is more suitable for the FPO's cost allocation issue than the eminent solutions, such as the Shapley value. © 2022 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {The pricing strategy of agricultural products not only affects the product demand and purchasing behavior of consumers, but also the income distribution of node enterprises and the overall profit of the agricultural supply chain. This paper studies the pricing strategy of the agricultural product supply chain with farmer cooperatives as the core enterprise. Considering the heter-ogeneous demand of consumers, this paper introduces the degree of agricultural product characteristics and establishes a dynamic pricing model for agricultural products under decentralized de-cision-making and centralized decision-making and designs a revenue sharing coordination con-tract. The results indicate that the overall profit of the supply chain obtained by pricing agricultural products through a decentralized decision-making model is lower than that created under centralized decision-making. Improving the degree of agricultural product’s characteristics and adopting the revenue sharing contract is conducive to the Pareto improvement of supply members. The rele-vant recommendations provide a reference for the product pricing strategy of this type of agricultural product supply chain. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To what extent do U.S. credit unions follow cooperative principles, reflect the cooperative identity, and distinguish themselves from other financial institutions? As credit unions grow and diversify their membership, many argue that credit unions will lose their cooperative identity and become more akin to their counterparts in the for-profit banking sector. This paper presents evidence that U.S. credit unions continue to differentiate themselves from other forms of banks. In their governance structure, credit unions rely on volunteer directors and CEOs are significantly less incentivized by performance-based compensation relative to commercial bank CEOs. Moreover, 51 % of credit union CEOs are female versus only 3% of CEOs at similarly sized community banks. Credit unions also offer better interest rates, provide higher quality loans, avoid overly risky lending practices (e.g., subprime mortgages), and are more likely to open and retain branches in low-income and diverse areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Wheat and rapeseed are significant crops in Czech agriculture and remote sensing has huge potential for their management, given Sentinel-1 can overcome issues of cloudiness and monitor vegetation development via radar backscatter. This study compares radar and optical data characterizing the development of wheat and rapeseed in an agricultural cooperative in the Czech Republic. Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series of the main vegetation seasons between 2015 and 2018 are processed, analysed, and compared with each other. In 2018, the comparison of data with ground measurement by camera was also used. The temporal development of RVI is affected by noise, which is caused by the composition of imagery from different Relative orbits. The separation of imagery according to the Relative orbit used seemed to provide results more comparable to the phenological curve. Simple linear regression between NDVI and RVI illustrated that considering Relative orbit can slightly increase the Coefficient of determination. By selecting a suitable Relative orbit, the coefficient of determination between NDVI and RVI increased from 0.281 to 0.387 in the case of wheat and from 0.233 to 0.316 in the case of rape monitoring. The RVI for rapeseed and the height of canopy correlation was 0.392. The results for RVI presented in this article demonstrated that monitoring wheat and rapeseed development by Sentinel-1 has potential, however more research needs to be conducted in the areas of spatial and temporal noise removal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

To ensure a sustainable future, renewable energy sources should be used worldwide. With the initiation of the industrial revolution, humankind started to use the world's energy resources without thinking about nature and future generations. Excessive consumption of available resources polluted the environment and altered climate patterns. Depleting fossil fuels in the near future and climate change will force world countries to tend to renewable energy sources. The present research was conducted to investigate the renewable energy awareness and adaptation of managers of agricultural development cooperatives composed of farmers, the most vulnerable segment of society to climate change. With the questionnaires, data were gathered about the general status of agricultural cooperatives, the socio-economic status of cooperative managers, managers' level of knowledge, and awareness of renewable energy resources. Survey data were subjected to fuzzy pairwise comparison and chi-square tests. Present findings revealed that cooperative managers had a medium level of knowledge on renewable energy. In addition, the cooperatives were willing to use and invest in renewable energy. This finding may guide policymakers in renewable energy investment decision-making. © 2022 University of Kuwait.

About 80 million rural Indian households are engaged in milk production with a very high proportion being landless, small and marginal farmers. The study aims to analyse the challenges faced by the dairy industry in generating employment and expanding their business. The paper has taken data from annual survey of industries over 20 years and a case study with a detailed interview of a cooperative society working in the dairy sector. The analysis is based on autoregressive distributed lag model. With the help of analysis, the study found that the dairy industry has the potential to generate employment. During the interaction for the case study, it was observed that firms in the dairy industry undertake the production of value-added products to yield profits which is limited due to low investments. However, the lack of advertisements of these products results in restrained sales and limits income of the farmers. Therefore, the study suggests that the private sector should be encouraged through product link incentive scheme and the government should intervene as a facilitator for their growth and expansion on international levels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Society of Labour Economics.},

    abstract = {The use of EU-approved pesticides is low in Ondo State, especially among smallholder cocoa farmers. Perhaps, trade credit, being one of the most important sources of credit, would increase the use of EU-approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers. Therefore, this study investigated access to trade credit and its impact on the use of EU-approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers in Ondo State. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 240 smallholder cocoa farmers for the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a double hurdle regression model, and an endogenous switching probit regression model. The descriptive results showed that on average, respondents were 44 years of age, 16 years of farming experience, 7 people for household size, and 2.70 hectares for farm size. Most of the respondents obtain trade credit from their respective farmers' cooperatives (82%), while others obtain trade credit from input suppliers (73%) and cocoa exporters (66%). It was also noted that only 35% (84/240) of the smallholder cocoa farmers use EU-approved pesticides on their cocoa farms. A majority (73.4%) of the respondents used the Ridomin 66WP gold (Cuprous Oxide + metalaxyl-M). Others use Esiom 150SL (Acetamiprid) (37.5%), Funguran-OH (Copper hydroxide) (49.1%), touch down fort (Glyphosate) (47.5%), and Actara 25WG (Thiamethoxan) (25%). The result further showed that age, gender, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and assets significantly influenced the probability of a farmer receiving trade credit. However, gender, household size, year of farming experience, cooperative membership, and assets are statistically significant in determining the amount of trade credit obtained by the farmers. The first stage of the ESPM revealed that gender, age, household size, farm size, and cooperative membership significantly influence the smallholder cocoa farmers' access to trade credit. While the second stage of the ESPM revealed that significant use of EU-approved pesticides among users of trade credit is affected by age, household size, education, access to extension services, and cooperative membership. Meanwhile, among non-users of trade credit, variables such as age, farming experience, farm size, land ownership, and cooperative membership significantly affect the use of EU-approved pesticides. After controlling for observed and unobserved covariates, the study concluded that access to trade credit positively impacts the use of EU- approved pesticides among smallholder cocoa farmers. It was concluded that policy strategies aimed at increasing the use of EU-approved pesticides among small cocoa farmers should take into account trade credit. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Complementarily, it analyzes the interaction of organizational risk management in the relationship between cooperative behavior and knowledge sharing. Theoretical framework – The research is based on the literature on cooperative behavior, organizational risk management, and knowledge sharing with variables derived from previous literature. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted with strategic level managers in Brazilian agricultural cooperatives, with the sample being composed of 104 valid responses. To test the hypotheses, the structural equation modeling technique was applied. Findings – The results show that cooperative behavior positively and significantly influences risk management and knowledge sharing; however, no statistical significance was found in the relationship between risk management and knowledge sharing. This indicates that higher levels of cooperative behavior are reflected in greater risk management, which helps to mitigate risks, and in greater knowledge sharing in the cooperatives studied. Practical & social implications of research – It presents new information relating to cooperative behavior and risk management in knowledge sharing in cooperatives that integrate strategic alliances. As practical implications, it is highlighted that knowledge sharing should not be perceived as an immediate risk, but as being inherent to cooperation and collaboration between parties. Originality/value – It contributes to the literature by presenting new implications of cooperative behavior and risk management, perceived as enablers of knowledge sharing. © FECAP.},

    abstract = {In 1951, six years after the United States defeated Japan and commenced the Occupation of Okinawa, the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus (USCAR) issued an ordinance in support of agricultural cooperatives. Despite the appearance of altruism, the move marked the emergence of the U.S. anticolonial empire, a form that advocated racial and ethnic self-determination even as it expanded the U.S. military presence. This article shows how U.S. policymakers in Okinawa borrowed from modernization theory to implement models to foster ethnic identification through economic development. Their plans sought to render the United States an ally to Okinawa freedom despite the devastating effects militarism had on the local landscape. Specifically, military plans posited frameworks like the Okinawan economy, which strategically turned the military into a partner without whom Okinawa could not modernize. The article further focuses on agriculture, an arena where the contradictions of the U.S. Occupation was most acute. It argues that rehabilitating the local cooperative network drew Okinawans into the military project, not only to paper over the U.S. colonial presence, but also to further the reach of military discipline. © 2022 by the Pacific Coast Branch, American Historical Association.

    abstract = {Organising smallholder farmers into groups or co-operatives is widely promoted as a strategy to connect farmers to markets and turn them into price makers rather than price takers. This pathway usually combines co-operative organisational models, based on collective ownership and representation in internal governance, with measures to shorten the agri-food chain, shifting the ownership of intermediary sourcing, aggregating and trading functions to the group. The underlying assumption is that this improves smallholder farmers' terms of inclusion in markets. To scrutinise this assumption, our study compares two examples of farmer-led auctions facilitating trading in the chilli market in Java, Indonesia. The auctions' ownership, management and performance evolved differently: one was run by a group and the other by a family. The comparison brings nuance to the prevalent emphasis on co-operative ownership structures. By researching practices central to collective trading at the chilli supplier–trader interface, this study unravels four dimensions—ownership, voice, reward and risk—capturing smallholder chilli farmers' terms of inclusion in both the auctions and the market. Our comparative analysis suggests that shared ownership and control of the trading function, a central feature of co-operative models, does not necessarily ensure favourable terms of inclusion for smallholder farmers with little capacity to take risks. The capacity to reconfigure the terms of market inclusion for vulnerable smallholder farmers involves direct payment modalities and risk taking. A collectively owned trading organisation does not necessarily imply an inclusive business concept when the organisation cannot acquire sufficient working capital to pay its suppliers. © 2022, The Author(s).},

It happens because the more the organisation acquires and disseminates stakeholder intelligence, the more it will be aware of the needs of different stakeholder groups, bending the decision making towards less powerful stakeholders and creating social performance. At the same time, more stakeholder intelligence is a strategic resource to be exploited favouring the economic performance. Moreover, it is proposed this effect is mediated by social motivations. Design/methodology/approach: In all, 251 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives were sampled and a survey primary data collection method was applied. To test our hypothesis, the partial least squares structural equation modelling method is used. Findings: It is found that SO positively influences social and economic performances. Social motivation mediates the relationship between SO and social performance. Originality/value: Social performance has gained importance because strategies harmful to society are not acceptable anymore and because of the link with economic performance. However, the strategic marketing literature is still scant on how marketing can drive economic and social performance at the same time. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Drawing on a detailed analysis of governance dynamics of Lianhua village, Hunan province, this study finds that migrant famers could undermine village governance in the place of destination from three dimensions: by disturbing social orders; overpricing or exploiting farmland; and paralyzing operation of village affairs. The critical factor deciding whether migrant farmers commit such acts is the degree of their spontaneous solidarity. This study also finds that implementing collective management among migrant farmers in a neoliberal manner could help address village governance challenges brought by them but is not conducive to their social integration into the hosting societies. © 2022 Lex localis.},

Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the impact of farmland rights and land transfer on access, demand, and amount of agricultural loan under the socialist system of China. For this purpose, data from China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) were used to empirically analyze the objectives of the study using various econometric approaches particularly, the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method and Benchmark regression. Results depicted that farmland rights and land transfer-in positively and significantly impacted access, demand, and amount of loan. However, the land transfer-out reduced the demand for agricultural loan. Moreover, the land transfer-in found a positive mediating impact on access, demand, and amount of agricultural loan. While the negative mediating effect of the land transfer-out was only reflected in the access and demand for agricultural loan. The farm output of the previous year significantly and positively impacted availing the agricultural loan. While the age of farmers significantly and negatively impacted on availing the agricultural loan. The results also confirmed the regional differences regarding the impact of farmland rights and land transfer-out on availing the agricultural loan. Findings of the study suggest public authorities to increase capital input through state-owned farm assets to reduce the funding gaps and promote agro-environmental sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

One primary governance issue relates to the legal form used to perform microfinance activities. The sector deploys various forms including Banks, Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Cooperatives and NGOs, but each of them has unique features that lead to different orders of priorities and to distinct structures and mechanisms to pursue such a dual objective. This study compares the board governance model and the performance of cooperative organizations (COOPs) with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in microfinance. Using data on 352 rated microfinance institutions, the test results show that, compared to NGOs, COOPs have larger boards and a higher number of board meetings. However, NGOs have a greater percentage of international board members. The test on performance reveals that, whereas COOPs are more cost-efficient and charge lower interest rates, NGOs generally perform better in terms of social performance. However, the two organizational types do not perform differently in terms of profitability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

To fill this gap, we present and discuss a theoretical framework based on recent literature, an in-depth case study from Uganda and quantitative analyses of data on horticultural cooperatives from Senegal and agricultural and livestock cooperatives from Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Rwanda and Kenya. We uncover the existence of cooperatives built on land sharing schemes in different parts of Africa and especially in Rwanda. We find that these LSCs are more likely to mobilize collective marketing and have a higher business-membership ratio than traditional cooperatives, and we derive a few implications for policymaking. © 2021 Edgard Milhaud Foundation},

    abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper was to identify the determinants of patronage of agricultural insurance in Delta north agricultural zone, Delta State Nigeria. Material and Methods: A multistage sampling technique was used to select 120 respondents. Data were obtained through questionnaire administration. Descriptive statistics, logit model, and t-test were employed in the study. Results: The findings showed that the mean age was 48 years with 59.2% of female farmers. About 60% of them had secondary education with a mean farm size of 2.10 ha. The mean farming experience was 11 years with 75% of the farmers not belonging to a cooperative society with a mean income of N80, 278.33. The major risks were pests, high temperature, variation in yield, flood and the least were a fire outbreak. Only 39.2% of the farmers are aware of agricultural insurance. The logit model showed that the age of farmers, educational level, premium rate, farm size, accessibility to credit, gender, awareness, and land tenure influenced farmers' decision to patronize agricultural insurance. Conclusion: This study examines insurance patronage by highlighting the interaction between the socioeconomic factors of farmers and the decision to patronize insurance. As far as this study is concerned, the identified factors will significantly improve patronage and increase productivity. © 2022 Agriculture Faculty of Ege University},

    abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to determine the factors affecting cooperates’ satisfaction when joining high-tech agricultural cooperatives in Vietnam’s Northern Key Economic Region. Theoretical framework: The study absorbed previous studies and expert opinions to determine the member' satisfaction coming to high-tech agricultural cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data was collected through a direct survey of 395 members participating in high-tech agricultural cooperatives. Then, the study uses the method of partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis and assess the satisfaction level of the members. Finding: The research results show that the factors affecting the satisfaction of cooperative members include 7 factors: working environment, trust, managers, level of participation, perceived benefits, support policies, and service capacity. Research, Practical & Social Implication: Based on the results of this study, several solutions to improve the current association activities with the role of the cooperative model as the core are proposed. People are encouraged to participate more in the association by improving the management skills of cooperatives, strengthening support activities, creating jobs, and raising incomes for people. Originality/value: Members' satisfaction will promote the activities of linking production and consumption with the main role of the cooperative, not just stopping at the immediate propaganda activities. Since then, these activities also improve people's confidence when participating in the association. Specifically, collective economic development must come from the needs of the people and participating organizations. Copyright © 2022 by Animal Bioscience.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the financial condition and ability of farmer cooperatives to withstand significant increases in bad debt expense. Design/methodology/approach: A unique data set of farmer cooperative financial statements that spans from 1996 to 2019 is used to examine the changes in profitability, solvency, liquidity and accounts receivable risk. Also, a deterministic stress test model is designed to shock bad debt expense and the resulting write-off of accounts receivable for farmer cooperatives. The stress test provides insights to the resiliency of farmer cooperatives. Findings: Results find that farmer cooperatives are in a strong financial position, which has improved over time. The majority of farmer cooperatives are able to absorb a substantial increase in bad debt expense because of their sizable, retained earnings position. However, cooperatives that have significant profitability challenges do experience much larger losses, especially mixed farmer cooperatives (roughly equally amounts of grain and farm supply sales) and large cooperatives with more than $500 million in sales. Practical implications: The stress test results suggest farmer cooperative managers and boards of directors could re-examine their credit policies and consider extending additional credit. Also, cooperatives should consider monitoring and identifying an optimal accounts receivable to retained earnings ratio, which is similar to how banks examine their tier 1 capital ratios. Originality/value: The value of this study is having data that allows for the examination of the financial condition of farmer cooperatives over time. Also, having current data means the accounts receivable stress test results are more relevant and timelier. This is important because these accounts receivable are primarily tied to crop input supplies, and farmer cooperatives are a significant market participant in the crop input supply market. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We first provide descriptive evidence of depositor discipline in credit unions: shares and deposits as well as savings interest rates react to variables that reflect the financial health of the credit union and its asset risk. We show that this discipline is long-lasting and that it is mediated by the existence of a deposit guarantee scheme and by the strength of the relationship of members with the credit union. We then use proxies of the capability of members to process financial information to show that discipline is heavily influenced by member financial sophistication. Our results suggest that a type of market-based discipline acts as a complement for regulation in controlling credit union risk taking, thus contributing to overall financial stability. © 2021 The Authors.

In this paper we explored the literature to develop a conceptual framework to determine how primary industry co-operatives (such as in agriculture and aquaculture) can play a role in managing natural capital. The conceptual framework developed shows that members of co-operatives have roles to act within their organisation that utilise natural capital. Acting out these roles may see the co-operative become pro-active in governing its natural capital based on economic and social goals which are guided by the co-operative principles and values. Working with the financial services sector, co-operatives would be able to engage with their members to educate and share knowledge on strategies to manage and/or mitigate the risk of natural capital depletion. This can be managed through farm management techniques and financial instruments such as credit and insurance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Drawing on a historical study of the Walloon dairy cooperatives, this paper analyses how complex cooperative dynamics define lock-ins in their trajectories. We consider cooperatives as firms active on markets and as structures of collective action gathering farmers-members around common strategic goals. Williamson's framework from New Institutional Economics accounts for the embeddedness of firms' strategies and governance in their wider context of development. Under the influence of this context of development, Ostrom's IAD (Institutional Analysis and Development) and SES (Social-Ecological Systems) frameworks, merged in a so-called CIS framework, capture the dynamic interplay between the components of cooperatives. Resorting to a combination between these frameworks, this paper discusses how the interplay between the components of the cooperatives' social-ecological system unfolded in the trajectories of the Walloon dairy cooperatives over the last sixty years. We uncover a double social dilemma at play. On the part of the farmers, the social dilemma anchors itself in the tension between their short-term interests as milk supplier over those of principal investor. On the part of the cooperatives' directors, the social dilemma anchors itself in the features of linking and bridging social capital in the region, unfavourable to inter-cooperative dialogue. In the Walloon Region, these social dilemma constituted a structural driver of the competition between dairy cooperatives and the subsequent inability to cooperate and invest towards successful long-term diversification pathways. We discuss how contextual factors, in particular market features, regulatory frameworks, socio-political features, and institutional support to dialogue, may aggravate, or conversely mitigate the effect of these social dilemma on cooperatives' trajectories. We call for more historically-informed studies on the impact of context on cooperative dynamics and stress the relevance of contextualized approaches to unlock prospective dynamics of collective agency in transition pathways. © 2022 The Authors},

    abstract = {Five years after the implementation of the tourism precision poverty alleviation strategy, how effective it has been in alleviating poverty remains to be tested. This study, through a study of 241 farm households in 10 national tourism poverty alleviation key villages in the Qinba Mountain region of Hanzhong, southern Shaanxi, finds that rural tourism has contributed to a general increase in farm household income, but the effect of income increase varies significantly between households that have escaped poverty and non-poor households, and there is no significant difference in income between those who participate in tourism and those who do not. The study concludes that the poverty-reducing effects of tourism are conditional, with the poor quality of human capital being the main obstacle to farm households’ income growth, the institutional mechanism for tourism participation is inadequate, effective farm household tourism participation is significantly low, and non-farm work constitutes a substitute for farm households’ tourism livelihood options. The primary stage tourism scenic spots have a limited role in driving the income of farming households, and the geographical location limits the effective participation of farming households. Accordingly, the following countermeasures are proposed: (1) in terms of strategic decision-making options, establish a screening mechanism for tourism participation in poverty alleviation and implement diversified poverty governance; (2) in terms of tourism development strategies, encourage the integration of multiple industries and synergistic development, realize the two-way interaction of “+ tourism” and “tourism +”; (3) in terms of development methods, adhere to the participatory development path, improve the institutional mechanism for tourism participation, stimulate the endogenous motivation of farmers, and explore the dynamic participation path of “bottom-up”. (4) In the development of endogenous power, strengthen skills training, improve the comprehensive quality of farmers and their participation level and ability; (5) In the coordination and protection, play the coordinating and leading role of grass-roots party building, and continuously cultivate and strengthen tourism cooperative organizations. © 2022 by the authors.

    abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the fiscal incentives and public financing destined to the promotion of Workers’ Cooperatives in Mexico, as well as the participation of cooperatives in activities that may represent transgressions to the fiscal and labor laws of our country. The results show that the economic crisis of the 1980s forced a change in the economic model and cooperatives were relegated from public policies. The relationship with the State fractured again in 2013 when cooperative companies were accused of fraudulent operations to avoid paying federal taxes, as a consequence, special taxation regimes were eliminated and public financing was reduced. However, the information published by the country’s administrative authorities does not provide evidence to ensure that in the last 11 years the cooperative organizations have constituted a risk factor for federal public finances and the labor stability of workers. This research applies a mixed method, which means the combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods and techniques. In the first case, the hypothetical-deductive method is used, and in the second, grounded theory and hermeneutic triangulation.

    abstract = {Nowadays, there are many preconditions and circumstances for conducting shadow schemes in the financial market. Therefore, the level of risk of participation of bank and non-bank financial intermediaries in such schemes is assessed as high. The lack of a practical methodology for assessing the development trajectory of financial intermediaries raises the question of the need for preventive control and quality modeling of their growth dynamics. The study aims to identify and formalize the patterns of development paths of banking and non-banking financial intermediaries based on the Harrington desirability function, which will be used to identify risk patterns as indicative patterns of financial intermediaries' participation in shadow schemes. The sample includes 13 banking institutions, 3 credit unions, 3 pawnshops, 3 insurance companies, and 3 financial companies. The obtained results showed the relationship between the financial intermediary risk level in terms of its participation in shadow schemes and the phases of the economic cycle as a catalyst for the economic dynamics of the formal and informal economy. Thus, in 2012-2015, most financial intermediaries were in the zone of most significant risk, especially banks, characterized by economic, social, and political instability. Today, banks are in the group with a controlled level of risk of participation in scheme operations. Over the years analyzed, a stable neutral level of risk of participation in shadow schemes was inherent in most non-bank financial institutions. They were less sensitive than banks to the phases of the economic cycle. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives. All rights reserved.},

Following the logic that they are motivated by the expectations of members and directors, this study associates these transformations with the banking services rates offered by credit unions. We employ ordered and multinomial logit models to investigate whether abnormal positive bank spreads—reflecting rates that could offer few advantages to members and large private benefits to directors—increase the probability of transformation. Our results indicate that the expectations of members and directors explain credit unions’ transformation, as seen in size and performance. The evidence reinforces that, under expectations of gains, members and directors play an active role in the decision to transform the ownership structure of credit unions, suggesting improvements in the corporate governance and incentives for mergers so that credit unions can grow to benefit members. © 2022 FUCAPE Business School.

    abstract = {This paper analyzes the decision-making factors that influence the generational succession of young members or children of members of agricultural cooperatives in the grain, meat, and dairy segments in the southern region of Brazil. First, 25 factors that influence the process of generational succession, called decision-making factors, were identified through a literature review and dialogue with the cooperatives. Then, using the methodology adapted from Slack, Chambers and Johnston (2007), a sample of 308 young people between 18 and 30 years old evaluated the level of importance and performance of the decision-making factors indicated. In the respondents’ opinion, none of the 25 factors performed better than their importance, as all factors present the possibility of improvement. However, according to the evaluation methodology used in this paper, 20 factors (property size; access to technologies; access to media and information; labor availability; diversification of agricultural activities; income provided by agricultural activities; access to education; social interaction and number of people in the community; professional expectations; remuneration received by the youth; education; type of work performed; marriage; autonomy; family dialogue; encouragement and recognition; technical assistance; presence of the cooperative, union, and associations; and access to marketing) performed adequately and did not require improvements in any of the three cooperatives. On the other hand, five factors need improvement: leisure infrastructure; road infrastructure; social valorization; rural credit and public policies; and price, according to the grain cooperative; leisure infrastructure, road infrastructure, social valorization; and price, according to the dairy cooperative; and social valorization and price, according to meat cooperative. We concluded that a significant part of the factors (80 %) performed in an adequate way directly or indirectly in the three cooperatives. The youth of the three cooperatives indicated social valorization and price among the factors that need improvement. Thus, we highlight that agricultural cooperatives should seek to understand their role in the face of decision-making factors that need improvement and seek to improve them. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {While Ostrom-inspired research has proven an important corrective to the simplistic “markets or government” dichotomy that continues to shape social and administrative sciences, this paper uses a case study to suggest that in some circumstances, our understanding of the commons could be enriched by giving more weight to the role governments can play in helping to constitute a human-made commons. In particular, this paper examines the case of a little-known deposit insurance scheme run by credit unions in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that has operated without once incurring a deficit for 70 years despite offering the kind of unlimited deposit insurance frowned upon by policymakers. We find that the provincial government played an important role in constituting the scheme and helping it operate, effectively, as a polycentric commons that until recently, satisfied all the design principles that tend to characterize successful collective management. The resulting argument is simple: it would be difficult to understand the stability of Saskatchewan’s credit union deposit insurance scheme without also understanding how government supported its operation as a commons. © 2022 The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Background: Reduction of post-harvest loses of crops are crucial tasks in ensuring food and nutrition security. However, a lack of knowledge on the extent of post-harvest losses and its associated impeding factors are posing major challenges to effectiveness of grain post-harvest loss management strategy and to scale up for all other crop types in Ethiopia. The study estimates the magnitude of post-harvest losses of all crops and identifies its determinants. Methodology: A national-level agriculture survey data were obtained from the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Tobit model analysis techniques. Results: The analysis shows 25.81% perceived annual average post-harvest losses of crops were obtained with considerable variation across the crop types. The main factors impeding post-harvest losses of crops were households with larger adult family size, higher levels of education attendance, and wealth status, large landholding size and damage of stored crops by insect pests infestation and/or rodent feeding due to utilization of traditional storage equipments, access to extension support services, cooperative marketing membership, and being far away from both all weathered roads and near local market centers due to a higher transaction costs associated with a lack of market information, contamination, and mechanical injuries. Conclusion: Minimization of post-harvest losses of crops could be achieved through a holistic approach by providing short and long-term training on post-harvest management practices, promoting the use of post-harvest technologies, paying special attention to the institutional support systems (agriculture extension and rural credit services), strengthening the support for post-harvest handling technologies, reinforcing the existing farmer cooperative marketing, and improvements of the local market and road networking infrastructures of rural areas should be undertaken by the government in collaboration with non-government organizations. © 2022, The Author(s).},

At the same time, organisational and institutional dairy innovations (OIDI), including group milk sales, feed and credit access, could boost dairy supply chain efficiency. This study examined the TDI adoption determinants and the OIDI adoption intensity. Data were collected from 1146 farmers (410, 382 and 354 in the milksheds of Mukurweini Wakulima Dairy Limited [MWDL], Happy Cow Limited [HCL] and New Kenya Co-operative Creameries [NKCC], respectively) and analysed using a double hurdle model. Access to credit positively influenced the TDI adoption in the three milksheds. Adoption of TDI was influenced by hired employees, dairy records, total dairy cows and household head education. The empirical evidence from the study supports the observation that OIDI adoption intensity is influenced by income, farm size, dairy records, and dairy information access. To boost TDI adoption, the dairy development partners should link cooperative society members with agricultural credit lenders. Additionally, the dissemination of dairy information to farmers by the dairy stakeholders could spur TDI adoption, while providing dairy information and training farmers on dairy record keeping should be promoted to boost TDI and OIDI adoption. © 2022 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

However, Greek agricultural cooperatives are usually small and characterised by low levels of processing facilities, technical skills and marketing expertise. One of the most emblematic products that these coops produce is olive oil, a product of widely recognised nutritional value, unique health benefits and increasing global demand. Approximately one-quarter of the country's 300 thousand tone production comes from the island of Crete. The goal of this study was to map the olive-oil producing cooperatives of Crete and examine the extent of their inter-cooperation and the barriers they encounter. In addition to being a key cooperative principle, cooperation among cooperatives can create new sales channels, lead to significant cost reductions, better profit margins, increased bargaining power and knowledge exchange.

    abstract = {Coffee cooperatives from the Huatusco region in Mexico have played an important role in helping coffee farmers in this region maintain economic viability in the midst of the economic crisis in Mexico and the international crisis of the coffee sector over time. While this type of organization has played an important role, not all of those organizations have survived over time. Using information from interviews with leaders of five longeval coffee producer cooperatives in the Huatusco coffee region, this study aims to identify the coffee cooperatives characteristics that can explain the longevity and long-term sustainability of these organizations. Additionally, using information from interviews, we evaluated challenges that could put at risk the long-term sustainability of these associations and strategies to overcome these challenges from the cooperative leadership perspective. Findings from this study suggest that motivations behind the creation of these producer associations go beyond accessing government resources. An institutional structure where there is a democratic process behind the election of leaders, leadership positions with predefined, not long, tenure terms, and association strategies to increase member engagement could explain the longevity of these organizations. Regarding challenges the cooperatives may be facing in the future, the aging population of growers is perceived by cooperative leaders as one of the major challenges they may be facing. Increasing youth involvement in the cooperatives through training and educational activities was perceived by cooperative leaders as a strategy to overcome this challenge © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 International license},

This study examines cases of the Knights’ producer cooperativesto understand how they functioned and why they failed.The intent of the co-operatives was to restore worker independenceand control over their work in the emerging factory system. This study applies core frames of social movements to examinethe motivation and processes the Knights used to establish their cooperatives.Micro histories of selected co-ops in three regionsof the U.S. were developed from primary research conducted duringthe 1880s as well as contemporary journals and newspapers. Rather than being radical, the co-operatives were based on Americanrepublican ideals, and they borrowed governance structures similar to corporations, both of which contributed to their success. Reasons for the failure of the Knights and their co-ops areexamined.

    abstract = {Cooperatives are entities with regulatory and operational singularities that make them different from other commercial companies in the business landscape. The relations with the workers, the remuneration of the partner’s contribution and the way in which the results are distributed configure them as companies of a deep social nature, even though they also have a commercial nature. After reviewing the contents of the studies aimed at the identification of business failure prediction models, we have observed that there are still very few which address cooperative societies, despite the importance of this kind of organization in our business landscape. In addition, most of the papers follow traditional statistical methodologies. In fact, the different methodologies used in this field of research have evolved over time; and one of the newest and most innovative is Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which to the best of our knowledge has not been applied in this research area. The objective of this study is to show the usefulness of Extreme Gradient Boosting methodology, which is based on machine learning techniques, in the prediction of business failure, particularly in the field of cooperative companies. We will determine whether the algorithm is suitable for the identification of the most relevant variables that indicate situations of financial distress. Therefore, it will allow to classify a company as failed or not failed. We will also analyze whether this technique is appropriate to explain the reasons leading to this classification. We also intend to contribute to overcoming the general absence in the literature of this type of studies in this business environment and to incorporate modern techniques based on artificial intelligence. To achieve the aims of the study, a model has been estimated from a sample of non-financial cooperatives that failed in 2015, belonging to various productive sectors. To consider a company as failed, a broad definition of failure has been chosen, because it allows us to clearly distinguish between failed and non-failed companies. Thus, the failure has been identified to the legal definition of insolvency, as contemplated by the present Spanish insolvency regulation. The selection made, taking into account this condition, consisted in 56 companies that had filed insolvency proceedings in the year considered. Thereafter, they have been paired with as many non-failed ones with similar characteristics, so that the final sample has consisted of 112 companies. Since our main goal is to formulate business failure prediction models, we have focused on those variables or financial ratios that provide information on aspects of the firm’s solvency and profitability, but without forgetting the influence of the company’s debts. To these main cate gories, we have added rotation, activity and asset structure. Given the uniqueness of this kind of companies we are considering, some clarifications have been made for some of the selected financial ratios, specifically for the debt and profitability ratios. Results from the statistical study show the importance of the variables related to solvency, liquidity, debt and profitability. These variables exhibited the most contribution to detecting a situation of business failure. The model combines in an effective way the variables of long-term solvency, liquidity, activity, and debt, and achieves a 100% accuracy rate in the training sample and 86% in an independent testing sample. The results have confirmed the higher the solvency and immediate liquidity of a cooperative company the lower the probability of failure. Additionally, the higher the variable that measures the ratio value added to sales the higher the probability of failure, as financial and personnel expenses are involved in this relationship. Finally, we have observed that profitability increases when cash flow grows in proportion to the company’s assets, therefore being consistent in the sense that as a company performs better the propensity for failure is reduced by being more profitable. These results are consistent with the empirical evidence: the higher the solvency and profitability rates the lower the failure probability, and the lower the debts the lower the exposure to failure. Consequently, we understand that the applied technique is quite effective for the objectives pursued, that is, the early detection of business failure for cooperative companies. Probably the variable less easy to compare is profitability since in a cooperative the book result is not comparable with the rest of commercial companies because it does not take into account the potential benefits of their partners through prices of cooperative products and services. The resulting model, in addition to classifying cooperative as failed and non-failed, has shown its potential to identify the underlying reasons for this classification. That is, the XGBoost model algorithm provides explanations about the variable’s weights in terms of failure probability for each observation of the test sample, splitting the individual weight and the influence sign of each of the predictors. Therefore, the final model is not only about high accuracy predictions, but also leads to results that are fully interpretable—it is possible to determine the sign and the effect of each variable or financial ratio on the final prediction for each and every one of the observations. The study is intended to be of a continuity nature because we consider it would be very interesting to carry out this type of analysis again but extending it to a series of several years in order to propose a model capable of detecting failure with a few years in advance. In short, we have demonstrated that this study contributes to the literature on business failure in the cooperative sector by means of showing the utility of a new methodology (XGBoost) capable of identifying cooperatives with a high probability of failure. The results are very accurate, and their interpretation is very easy. © 2021 CIRIEC-España},

    abstract = {Scientific literature has reported that participation in agricultural cooperatives has positive effects on small farmers' preference for organic fertilisers over chemical fertilisers. However, there is limited focus on enhancing the voluntary use of organic fertilisers by small farmers who have joined an agricultural cooperative. This paper describes an agent-based model for simulating small farmers' decision-making with regard to fertiliser selection. Ninety six farmers (members) of one of the largest strawberry production cooperatives in China were assessed to understand their willingness to use different fertilisers and their socioeconomic characteristics. Simulation results showed that for farmers belonging to the agricultural cooperative who earn higher marginal profits, variations in the prices of the agricultural produce had no significant effect on their behaviour in terms of the use of organic fertilisers. The number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year has a positive relationship with the increase in the rate at which farmers use organic fertilisers. However, the count does not alter the final number of farmers who use organic fertilisers after several years. Moreover, farmers' willingness to use organic fertilisers enhances the increasing speed and final number of farmers using organic fertilisers simultaneously. The design of strategies (increasing the number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year and enhancing farmers’ willingness to use organic fertilisers) has a significant effect on the promotion of organic fertiliser application by agricultural cooperatives in China. © 2021},

    abstract = {Tobacco has been grown in Tanzania since the 1950s and remains a designated strategic export crop cultivated under contract farming arrangements. This article examines the role of primary co-operative societies (PCSs) in co-ordinating the tobacco contract farming system. The article traces the transition from public marketing boards to private sector predominance and contributes to an understanding of the dynamics of contractual arrangements between private capital and smallholder tobacco farmers. It draws primarily on data collected through in-depth interviews with tobacco-processing companies and the leaders of PCSs in Urambo district, Tanzania. The analysis shows that the PCSs that are central to this sector need to ensure that their members farm in accordance with good agricultural practices and comply with reforestation and labour practice requirements as part of the industry’s focus on corporate social responsibility programmes and the promulgation of strategies addressing social and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the PCSs have become the gatekeepers for local development projects co-funded by the Tanzanian tobacco processing companies and global cigarette brand owners. The article argues that the PCSs’ ability to capture economic benefits for local development by tapping into the tobacco value chain depends not only on PCS leadership qualifications, capabilities and their capacity to ‘align’ farmers with the required cultivation practices, but also on the bargaining capacity of the PCSs in relation to the tobacco processing companies, which is influenced by whether the supply base is reliable in both quantity and quality. Recent developments in the contract farming arrangements provide new constellations of economic dynamics and opportunities for social and economic development activities at the PCS and village levels. The article ends with a discussion of rural development outcomes based on tobacco revenues, showing how contract farming integrates local communities into the dynamics of the global tobacco value chain while simultaneously reproducing local socio-economic differentiation. © 2022 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.},

    abstract = {Policymakers in Southern Africa have long viewed agricultural cooperatives as a way to reach rural households more easily, but because not all rural households can afford to join cooperatives, this raises questions about membership inclusivity and whether cooperatives advantage some smallholders over others. Agricultural cooperatives can serve as an institutional vehicle for policymakers to deliver direct benefits to smallholder farmers in the form of subsidized agricultural inputs, usually improved seed varieties and fertilizers. They can also serve as platforms for collective action through which smallholders can reduce transportation and transaction costs or disperse the costs of marketing. In Zambia farmers are required to join a cooperative to qualify for seed and fertilizer support through the national Farmer Input Support Program (FISP), which is a structural incentive for cooperative membership and makes it complicated to determine if cooperative membership increases use of inputs and yields on its own. Using the Inverse Probability Weight Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) technique, we find Zambian smallholders participating in cooperatives achieve significantly higher maize yields and use significantly more hybrid-maize seed and fertilizers, even when controlling for FISP eligibility. Furthermore, across all selected productivity and input variables we find greater average treatment effects from cooperative membership than FISP participation. Cooperative membership is also associated with more assets, more land, and higher maize yields, which suggests that the poorest rural households are often not cooperative members. Cooperatives can be a powerful poverty policy tool to deliver direct benefits to small farmers, but not including the poorest households likely widens the rural poverty gap, both in terms of limited direct benefits of input support programs and in terms of farmers missing out on cooperative-specific benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {US credit unions have been subject to a strict regulation of their commercial lending which included both requirements for enhanced organizational practices and a cap on the proportion of business loans relative to assets (imposed in 1998 by US Congress). Since 2003, however, these limitations have been steadily relaxed, a process which has resulted in an increase in credit union business lending activity. Using data from the universe of US credit unions we provide comprehensive evidence that expansion of the business loan portfolio increases the risk of the asset side of the credit union. This is the case even for credit unions which benefit from partnership with the SBA, for which we observe an initial increase in the risk of non-SBA backed loans (an overconfidence effect) which reverses over time (a learning effect). Our results suggest, furthermore, that the risk of business loans is exacerbated for credit unions which initiate their business loan activity and which do so rapidly. In the second part of our analysis we provide descriptive and quasi-experimental evidence that expansions of credit union activity into business loans are associated with lower subsequent growth rates of deposits. This result is similar to the reaction to risk indicators found in the banking literature and might give an ex-ante incentive for the CU that could work as a market-based stabilization mechanism complementary to that of explicit regulation. © 2021 The Authors},

    abstract = {The current agricultural system in China highly depends on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Consequently, agricultural production activities cause various environmental issues. Carrying out safe production provides vital support for sustainable development of agriculture, which may improve this situation. The past decades have witnessed the fast development of rural cooperatives organization in China. Given the fact that rural cooperative organization plays a crucial role in agricultural production, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative membership and safe production of smallholders in China. This study aims to investigate whether the participation in farmer cooperatives contributes to safe production in agriculture in China. Using survey data covering 623 rice-producing farm households in Sichuan province in China, this study employs the endogenous switching regression model to examine the effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. The results show that cooperative membership has significantly positive effects on safe production in rice agriculture. In particular, the average treatment effects demonstrate that without the participation in cooperatives, the members’ adoption of the green control techniques would reduce by 74.491%, the application of artificial weeding would reduce by 38.768%, and organic fertilizer input would reduce by 23.448%. Furthermore, the marginal treatment effect is employed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. Heterogeneous effect analyses suggest that farmers who are more likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt green control technology, while farmers who are less likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt artificial weeding and increase organic fertilizer input. To improve safe production in rice agriculture, the Chinese government is expected to encourage rice farmers to participate in rural cooperative organizations, and to stimulate rice farmers to take collective action to address environment issues arising from agricultural production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

In the case of agri-food cooperatives in the olive oil producing areas of Spain, a substantial share of the business is based around the social economy, with CIRIEC reporting a cooperativization rate of 70%. As such, there are increasing opportunities for these cooperatives to adopt tools that enable the potential development of social innovation actions. In the present article, we conduct a literature review to explore the definitions of social innovation provided in the last decade. We then analyse the results relating to a proposed model of social innovation applied to the olive oil industry, involving the participation of an expert panel composed of people with a position on the board of directors or managers of olive oil cooperatives and companies in the olive oil industry. From the analysis of the data collected, we identify four dimensions of Social Innovation that are particularly relevant to the olive oil industry: the Economic Dimension, the Cultural Dimension, the Environmental Dimension, and the Technological Dimension. These dimensions give rise to a methodological model for the implementation of Social Innovation actions in the olive oil industry. © CIHEAM – Istituto Agronomico Mediterraneo di Bari.},

    abstract = {Sunflower production is an excellent choice for both local and national agribusiness with significant potential in smallholder farming systems due to low input costs, consistent yields, and a short planting window. However, farmers are faced with interrelated constraints in their sunflower production. This study was undertaken to examines the perceptions of the constraints to sunflower production as perceived by smallholder farmers in North West Province, South Africa. The research identifies some factors related to sunflower production constraints. Then, a stratified random sampling technique was used to select 172 sunflower farmers and they were asked to rate their response on these attributes on a 5-points Likert scale. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we agglomerated and condense information from the original datasets of the constraint attributes into three main components (innovation, farm finance, and crop management practice). Because of the hierarchical structure of the dataset with farmers nested within their local municipalities, we use Hierarchical Logistic Modeling techniques to identify the factors that determine farmer’s perceived interest in innovation, farm finance, and crop management practices. Innovation and farm finance emerge to be critical elements for sustainable sunflower production. The findings indicate that age, education, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and gender are strongly correlated with farmers’ perceived interest in innovation and farm finance characteristics. This study recommends that to promote these elements among smallholder farmers, it is necessary for governments at the local and national level to invest in extension service and education, cooperative organizations, research, and development in disentangling the age, gender, and farm size inequalities existing in the district sunflower production. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {Recognition of co-operatives as a legitimate business model and form of economic participation was significantly challenged by the rise of neo-liberalism in the 1980s with its emphasis on individuals and markets. This fueled an externally and internally driven push to demutualize co-operatives and convert them into Investor Owned Businesses (IOB). While the international trend to demutualize emerged from the end of the Second World War, evidence indicates it accelerated from the late 1980s until the onset of the Global Financial Crisis. Drawing on an ongoing project of historical data collection and visual analysis of Australian co-operatives, this paper explores the Australian experience with demutualization, particularly with regard to agriculture. In line with the international experience, there has been a surge in Australian demutualization since the 1980s. However, while demutualization continues to be a feature of the Australian landscape post-GFC as co-operatives tackle with the changed political and economic environment, the paper also challenges the view that demutualization is inevitable for agricultural co-operatives. Co-operative managers can make strategic choices to avoid demutualization and retain member control. Further, co-operative culture and the persistence of co-operative clusters in particular regions can blunt the push to demutualize.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

In Nigeria, housing finance is through the formal and informal institutions; and personal residences accounted between 75 and 90 per cent of household wealth, that represents between 3 and 6 times their annual income. Finance is an important determinant of success and failure of housing ownership. It, therefore, becomes very necessary to identify viable sources of funding that can promote house-ownership. This paper examined the activities of Cooperative Societies in the provision of funds for house ownership in Nigeria with a focus on Akure. In the conduct of the social survey for the study; two sets of questionnaire were used. The first set of the questionnaire focused on House-owners and 683 sampled houses-owners were administered with the questionnaire in Akure. The second set of questionnaire was administered on the government officers' in-charge of the administration of the cooperative societies in Akure. The answers to the questions in the questionnaire were adequately supplied. The data were subjected to statistical analysis. The findings revealed among others that the main sources of funding house buildings were through personal savings and Cooperative Societies among others. It recommended that prospective house-owners should be encouraged to form and patronise Cooperative Societies as a reliable source for the housing loan. © 2021 The Authors},

    abstract = {The bioeconomy is considered one of the three main sectors with the greatest opportunities for the development of the circular economy in Brazil, who is one of the largest silk producers in the world; and sericulture is an agribusiness that contributes greatly to the bioeconomy in Brazil. Therefore, this research aimed to identify opportunities for creating value by internalizing flows in the production of silk cocoons by promoting a circular bioeconomy. To that end, a tool was used to assess the circularity of the referred system. The current circularity of the production of silk cocoons, at the farm level, is 74.19 % for material, and 0 % for energy. A range of measures are proposed, based on (i) engaging with reverse logistics practices, (ii) establishing a local agroindustrial cooperative, and (iii) building community biodigesters, which aid a potential circularity of 85.51 % (material), and 100 % (energy) at the farm level, and 98.42 % (material) and 100 % (energy), at the cooperative level. On top of increasing circular value, the proposed measures might bring environmental benefits, such as lessening environmental impacts of logistics (by valuing local resources) and replacing non-renewable energy, and social impacts, through increased quality of life for sericulturists. Economic implications need further investigation and are suggested to be addressed in future research endeavors, along with policy implications for the development of a circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, an increased circularity can also contribute to a few of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations, such as SDGs 2, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {A significant problem of the current land management in Slovakia is the long-term separation of usage and property rights. More than 91% of agricultural land is leased and used by larger agricultural enterprises (9%). Current common agricultural policies of the EU have been the subject of criticism for a long time, as inappropriate settings force farmers to manage unsustainably with a negative impact on biodiversity. Substantial, reliable and beneficial mutual information sharing between those who do business on the land, who own the land and who use the surrounding landscape, either as a living space for housing or relaxation and recreation might help to mitigate some issues. In this paper, the authors present an implemented proposal for multi-layer map and analytical support for land and soil use assessment. The model area includes the land units managed by the Agricultural Cooperative of Horná Nitra. The approach includes the identification of undesirable combinations according to criteria (degree of protection, area, type of use, erosion risk, and ecological stability) on each land block. This concept enabled the visualization and quantification of risks in the area in question through an online GIS application with a web interface. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

    abstract = {In the National Development Plan, cooperatives and agriculture development are identified as possible solutions for addressing rural poverty and unemployment, especially among the youth. However, according to most research/literature, agricultural cooperatives fail for many reasons, including but not limited to lack of capital, incompetent management and organizational deficiencies. This study applied a qualitative analysis to the qualitative data using a case study of Zanokhanyo Food Security Cooperative (ZFSC) in Ndabakazi, Butterworth. Interviews with the project members, ex-members, extension officers and youth were conducted through a semi-structured questionnaire administered in IsiXhosa. According to the results, lack of intensive production resulting in very low incomes is one of the reasons why projects such as ZFSC fail to attract young people and provide employment for rural people. Agricultural extension advisory services play a very limited role because of their generalist approach; they lack depth of knowledge about diverse agricultural subject areas. This study recommends that agricultural extension and the farmers’ support system be improved by employing or outsourcing specialists to cater to the needs of agricultural cooperatives in order to improve the productivity and income of agricultural cooperatives. © 2021, South African Society for Agricultural Extension (SASAE).

    abstract = {In 2020, COVID-19 has exerted a significant impact on the sale of agricultural products in China. Against this background, the e-commerce has played an important role in solving this problem. Therefore, it has once again become the focus of attention of the Chinese government and researchers. The co-operative is an important channel for Chinese farmers to sell agricultural products, and thus, it is a vital research issue to discuss whether the application of e-commerce in the co-operative is conducive to the improvement of its profitability. This study therefore uses Logit model to analyze the factors affecting the use of e-commerce in co-operatives and PSM model to calculate the impact of e-commerce on the profit margin of co-operatives. The following conclusions can thus be drawn: (1) The gender and education level of decision-makers and the degree of processing and relevant certification of products are important influencing factors, (2) e-commerce can significantly improve the profit margin of co-operatives, and (3) e-commerce plays a more significant role in improving the profit margin of co-operatives selling primary processed products. These study conclusions are based on national-level survey, and thus, the industrial policies should be formulated according to these influencing factors to support the development of e-commerce in co-operatives, especially those selling primary processed products. © Vilnius University, 2002-2021 © Brno University of Technology, 2002-2021 © University of Latvia, 2002-2021.},

    abstract = {Third sector organizations, like the rest of the economic system, have been heavily affected by the pandemic. The aim of this work is to study resilience and adaptability to crisis in terms of economic results and innovative outcomes of the cooperative business model in the Italian third sector during the COVID pandemic. This study uses new evidence from a recent survey on this sector and con-sists of two main parts. In the first, the institutionalist literature on contractual failures is assumed as an interpretative key in the comparison between the business models, gov-ernance, and routines in social cooperatives versus other non-profit organizations (NPOs) interpreted as third sector entities. In the second, we use the new data from a third sector survey in the Marche region, collected in the late spring of 2021 toward the end of lockdown measures. Empirical assumptions concern organizational resilience and adapta-tion to unexpected negative shocks in cooperatives and other NPOs. The results show that, in the management of the crisis, cooperatives are better able to preserve their human capital and resort to layoffs less often than other NPOs. Shared deci-sion-making, employee involvement, and the adaptability of the work process emerge as dominant organizational characteristics that support resilience and service innovation in cooperatives. The main policy implication concerns the ability of cooperatives to play a stabilizing and a-cyclical role during a crisis and to fill the supply gaps left open by other organizational forms (private, non-profit and the public sec-tor). The originality of this paper lies in the new approach to cooperative organizations and in the analysis of the reaction of cooperatives during the pandemic crisis. © 2021 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Across Turtle Island, Native communities are joining the Indigenous food sovereignty movement to reclaim their foodsystems, cultural practices, and economies. Cooperatives are a particularly viable organizational structure for these projects since Indigenous foodsystems historically depended on community cooperation and collective use of land and other resources. This paper is interested in the ways Native foodway initiatives are building producer cooperatives in the US as a method towards food sovereignty. To do so, authors conducted interviews, attended food sovereignty gatherings, and reviewed relevant literature to offer historical context, a theoretical framework for Indigenous food sovereignty producer cooperatives, and four Native-led food producer cooperative case studies that are working to increase access to fresh, local foods produced in accordance with the beliefs, behaviors, processes, and worldviews of their particular communities. The organizational structure and purpose of the four cooperatives differs, but they are united in a common commitment to stewarding the interspecies relationships foundational to Indigenous foodways. In doing so, these cooperatives are also expanding who, or what, counts as a “member.” We argue this offers a compelling model for ecologically and culturally integrated cooperative development in individual communities and a platform for (re)establishing foodways and trade relationships between Native Nations. © 2021},

    abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of this study was a theoretical and methodological generalization of the agroholdings’ social initiatives within their charitable activities with the interaction of cooperatives based on the institutional model. Methodology / approach. This study was based on applying the general economic and special methods. The abstract-logical method was used for scientific discussion and scientific views about the role of agroholdings and their impact on the rural population. The method of critical analysis was applied to outline the social aspects of agroholdings’ activities. The system approach allowed contouring the main problems that arise in the process of agroholding growing. The study of the state of agricultural cooperatives’ financing by agroholdings was also conducted. On the basis of the monographic method the motives and directions of the management of separate agroholdings within their social responsibility limits were defined. With the generalization method, the basic forms and resources of agroholdings’ social responsibility were determined. Thanks to the correlation-regression analysis, it was established the relationship between the social responsibility indicator of agroholdings and their efficiency by EBITDA, as well as their social responsibility and market capitalization degree. Results. The study examined the main scientific approaches to the role of agroholdings, which allowed outlining their ambiguity and contradictions. The systematization of the presented materials allowed developing arguments in favor of the agroholdings’ functioning and identifying counterarguments of their activities as well as emphasizing the need of the basic methodological provisions for further harmonious development of agroholding structures and cooperatives. The results of the presented empirical analysis showed a low level of agroholdings’ social responsibility, which affects the development of the rural areas and significantly increases social tensions. On the basis of the conducted research and data processing the mechanism of agroholdings’ and cooperatives’ interaction on the basis of social responsibility is offered. It was proved that the basis of the presented interaction must be financial and economic, social, marketing and environmental motives. Originality / scientific novelty. It was improved the theoretical and methodological approach to the formation of institutional model of the agroholdings’ and cooperatives’ interaction on the principles of social responsibility, which provides financial and economic, social, marketing, environmental problems solutions by agroholdings and promotes the rural community’s development in the near future. Practical value / implications. The results of the study are of great practical importance and can be useful for various ownership forms of agricultural producers as well as for agricultural holding organizations which are interested in harmonizing the rural economy development. © 2021, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

    abstract = {The collection and recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic modules is emerging as a challenge due to the dramatic growing installment of distributed PV systems worldwide. This paper studies the locational strategy for recycling facilities of end-of-life PV modules from the perspective of various stakeholders with a case in Zhejiang province, one of the leading regions in promoting distributed photovoltaic applications in China. The generation of end-of-life modules in the “Million Household Rooftop PV Project” in Zhejiang Province is estimated from 2041 to 2045. The regional reverse logistics network for collection of the retired PV modules is optimized using the Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) model. The article draws on the PV recycling scheme of PV CYCLE in Europe, and proposes the following two scenarios for comparison: (1) Scenario A: Municipal recycling, in which the local government takes the responsibility to establish the collection and recycling infrastructures; and (2) Scenario B: Producer cooperative recycling under Extended Producer Responsibility scheme, in which the PV producers use their sales and customer services network to help collecting the end-of-life PV modules. The different roles of the stakeholders affect the overall locational strategy for recycling. The result shows that: (1) Both scenarios result in similar path of the utility of recycling facilities: when only one recycling facility is needed in 2041, the recycling plant in Hangzhou will be used to minimize the overall transportation cost for the whole province; while more facilities are needed due to increasing generation of end-of-life modules in the next 4 years, regional collection centers will be assigned to the nearest recycling facility, dividing the province into three regional recycling group: “North Group (including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou)”, “South Group (including Jinhua, Lishui, and Quzhou)”, and the “Coastal Group (including Wenzhou and Taizhou)”. (2) Although the overall cost of reverse logistic in scenario B is slightly higher than scenario A at the beginning in 2041, integrating the producer's sales and service network into the collection network can significantly lower the overall reverse logistics cost up to 9.7 percent at the end of the 2043 when the waste PV generation achieves 72 thousand ton/year. The conclusion suggests the necessity to introduce the Extended Producer Responsibility principle in Chinese PV market to encourage the industry to participate in the construction of an efficient recycling system for the coming wave of end-of-life PV modules. © 2021},

    abstract = {Maintaining the diversity of small ruminant genetic resources is instrumental for sustainable agricultural production. Community-based livestock breeding programs (CBBPs) have emerged as a potential approach to implement breeding programs in smallholder farms. This study assesses the viability of CBBPs as a potential approach for conservation and improvement of indigenous small ruminants, using case studies of goat CBBPs in Malawi and Uganda. Data were collected using focus group discussions, personal interviews, and direct observations. The program promotes and empowers smallholders to have access to small ruminant feed resources through the protection of existing communal pasturelands, capacity building in pasture production, and conservation of crop residues and crop by-products. Implementation of the CBBP enhances the contributions through improved animal growth performance, kids’ survival, and twinning rates leading to increased offtake rates and better prices. The existence of permanently established supporting organizations and other stakeholders provides sustainable institutional support instrumental for the establishment and growth of CBBPs. However, the establishment of functional community-based institutions (producer cooperatives) and investments in institutional/policy reforms to safeguard fair trading, access to common resources by small ruminant keepers, and adoption of the CBBP model into national livestock development programs are some of the key milestones that can guarantee sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {Co-operatives in Thailand have played an important role in promoting self-reliance and financial advantages for their members. However, these co-operatives have also encountered their own technical and financial performance issues. This study asks whether a co-operative’s board capital (i.e., human capital and social capital) can positively influence that co-operative’s organizational performance via the mediating role of organizational capital (i.e., structural capital and financial capital). Data were collected from 133 co-operatives in several regions in Thailand, with the population sample comprising 133 managers and 529 employees of Thai co-operative businesses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of aggregated employee data (n = 529 [board capital]) and organizational-level data (n = 133 [organizational capital and organizational performance]) provided full support for the proposed hypotheses (X2/df = 1.827, RMSEA =.079, CFI = 0.911, TLI = 0.901, SRMR = 0.053). In particular, the board capital of the co-operatives was found to positively influence organizational performance via the mediating role of organizational capital. Furthermore, the results showed that agricultural co-operatives were rated significantly lower in terms of their board capital and organizational performance in comparison to non-agricultural co-operatives. These findings highlight the importance of different types of capital and the discrepancies that exist between agricultural and non-agricultural co-operatives, which deserves further attention from researchers © 2022.

For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was undertaken involving almost 500 consumers in the selected region. Consumers were segmented on the basis of their consumption of cooperative products and in association with their attributes and beliefs regarding cooperatives’ products. The performed cluster analysis grouped participants into four distinct groups with different characteristics and perceptions regarding cooperatives’ products. The consumer groups were called “skeptics”, “cooperative”, “passively sensitive”, and “indifferent”. According to the results, in general, participants considered cooperative food products as a safe choice with excellent value for money and contributing to the local society, economy, and sustainability. Segmentation could allow agricultural cooperatives to focus only on those segments of consumers that are willing to pay for cooperative products by allocating all available resources in serving them. The results of this research, even with its limitations, can help directors and marketing executives of agricultural cooperatives to better understand that operating in a specific market could be more effective when targeted at specific segments to help not only the viability of agricultural cooperatives but also their economic development and growth. © 2021 by the authors.

Nigeria is the largest producer of African catfish, yet species-level information is completely scanty in relation to encompassing nature of environmental, social and economic values. In this study, a field survey exercise of the operations, systems and yield of Eriwe fish farm village was conducted with 74 fish farm cooperatives. The present study sought to establish the sustainability status of catfish farming in the region using proposed indicators in the existing literature. Findings revealed catfish farming in the village is economically sustainable with an annual gross margin of $44,539 and $25,868, coupled with a net income of $44,386 and $25,728 for intensive and semi-intensive systems respectively. This was further established with net present value (NPV) of $10,279 and $8323 and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 2.16 and 2.35 for both systems respectively. Both systems were found to have low labour remuneration < 0.50, which are below the recommended standard of 1. Environmental sustainability indicators revealed 100% of farmers discharged untreated wastewater directly into the river. All catfish farmers in the village contributed to the annual upgrade of road networks and security assurance. Through this study, it was revealed catfish farming is economically sustainable in the region. However, the influence of catfish farming practices on the social factors and ecological values have been given little or no attention. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.},

Quantitative data on renewable energy production, economic, and market were used for each territory. Data collection techniques were bibliographic, documentary, and field research, through interviews with the managers of family farmers’ cooperatives, containing at least one representative from each evaluated territory. As a result, it was found that the contributions of renewable energy from wind sources installed in these regions are still incipient from the perspective of cooperative managers, although they believe that the appropriation of this technology by family farming could contribute significantly to the expansion of food production and market building. © Este é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a licença Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado..

    abstract = {The existence of cooperative organizations in today's business environment, particularly in agriculture, signals their continued ability to provide value to their member owners. However, due largely to data limitations, we know very little about the monetary value of ownership held by members and how value changes across members of differing characteristics. Through a discrete choice experiment with more than 200 dairy farmers in the United States, we examine these issues explicitly for dairy marketing cooperatives that purchase their members’ milk and process it into finished dairy products. Results suggest that dairy farmers, on aggregate, are willing to accept lower per hundredweight compensation, 2.3% of the average milk price, to be cooperative members relative to selling to independent handlers. Results also suggest dairy farmers actively consider the industry wide impacts within pricing offers on preferences for other milk pricing attributes. The inclusion of demographic covariates highlights preferences important to understanding heterogeneous member interests and, thus, informing improved cooperative governance strategies and board decision making to address them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The object is the Union and Organization of Cooperatives of Paraná State (OCEPAR) in the last two decades. The research considered, on one hand, the institutional constraints, external and internal to this entity, and, on the other hand, the social aspects of the members of this elite. In addition to the production of analytical categories able to deal with the particularities of this elite, we used Brazilian legislation on cooperatives, some economic data, documents from OCEPAR and other cooperative entities, and interviews. We found that the institutional aspects of business cooperativism and the social characteristics of this entity's leaders help to explain why presidents of the largest agro-industrial cooperatives occupy the majority of the OCEPAR board constituting a channel of political power between such cooperatives and the entity and the latter with the political institutions and authorities. Therefore, we verify that some institutional and social aspects strongly impact the recruitment of this cooperative elite and the constitution of the agro-industrial cooperativism as a political actor, a dimension of great relevance for addressing its economic importance. © 2022.

    abstract = {China began connecting farmers directly with supermarkets 10 years ago, when they were at a disadvantage and forced to sell products at low prices, as unstable cooperation among supply chain participants led to inequitable distribution of revenue. Revenue-sharing contracts offer a risk-sharing approach to ensure supply chain coordination and optimize profit for all. Research on short life cycle products with revenuesharing contracts assume stable prices or investigate the effects of revenue-sharing contracts on supply chain coordination. This study introduced a revenue-sharing contract model into a ‘farmer-supermarket directpurchase’ supply chain, considering price fluctuation and retail promotional efforts, stochastic market demand, among other factors. Revenue-sharing contracts achieved long-term stability in supply chain coordination, all participants obtained more profits, and the size of revenue-sharing parameter depends on the position and bargaining power of all participants.

    abstract = {This study was conducted to identify the challenges of crop production and marketing in southwest Ethiopia. Primary and secondary sources of data were used. Qualitative and Quantitative data types were collected from 385 respondents through interviews, focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and observations. The collected data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and econometric models. Crop productivity was analyzed by the Cobb Douglas model and its efficiency and determinants were identified by the stochastic frontier model. The major bottlenecks of crop production were the low attitude of farmers towards improved technology, low supply and usage of improved seed varieties (94.5%), low supply and use of fertilizers (95%), knowledge and skill gap of farmers (80.1%), poor extension service (57.3%), soil acidity (94.8%), diseases and insect pest (77.8%), conflict (84.9%) and the outbreak of human diseases (60%). Marketing challenges were poor infrastructure (87.3%), lack of market linkage (62.5%), and lack of credit services (70.6%). The Cobb Douglas model result revealed that land size, local seed, improved seed, repetition of weeding, and labor force influenced crop productivity. The mean level of crop technical efficiency was 51.3%. Education level, extension service, access to credit, cooperative membership, number of livestock owned, and soil fertility were influenced crop inefficiency negatively and distance to the farm was positively related to technical inefficiency. Improving extension services and skill of farmers through practical based training and building capacity of extension workers and systems to enhance the attitude of farmers towards technology usage and proper management practices, timely provision of farm inputs, improving road and market access, and provision of credit services to producers were some of the recommendations forwarded to alleviate crop production and marketing challenges in the study areas. © 2021 The Author(s)},

    abstract = {Communities prosper when they are able to appropriate the wealth they produce and their institutions make peoples’ lives meaningful. They wither when the institutions that permit this weaken or vanish. Sacrifice zones — abandoned, economically shattered places, with growing social and health problems — are spreading in historically white rural areas and small towns across the United States. Rural decline, rooted in economic restructuring and financialization, causes severe stress, exacerbates racial resentment, and creates a breeding ground for regressive authoritarian politics. A multidimensional approach must analytically connect long-term and recent trends affecting economy and livelihoods, institutions, health, and community life. The “racial resentment” and “economic distress” explanations for authoritarian populism are inextricably connected. Since the 1980s, and in intensified form after the 2008 financial crisis, capital has systematically undermined the institutions — mutually-owned banks, credit unions, mom-and-pop businesses, family farms — that fostered reinvestment of locally-produced wealth, especially but not only in rural areas. While many Trump voters were affluent suburbanites, another important sector of supporters consists of downwardly mobile inhabitants of zones where financialization and austerity destroyed the institutions that earlier allowed people to appropriate the wealth that they produced and where the social safety net, always fragile, is increasingly in tatters. The United States now has a poor and near-poor majority. Scholars and the media have underestimated the human toll of this crisis and the interconnectedness of the multiple processes of social decomposition affecting rural zones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This study contributes to maintaining the business linkage model among farmers - cooperatives - enterprises in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic and quickly recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used for data analysis following an iterative process based on theoretical and empirical analyses to obtain a structural model fit and test the research hypothesis. The findings indicate that the VCI positively influenced the VCP of Chu-mango business linkages at the 1% significance level through coordination (Beta = 0.345; construct reliability (CR) = 3.272), collaboration (Beta = 0.289; CR = 3.128), and joint decision-making (Beta = 0.324; CR = 3.245). This study provides empirical data on the relationship between VCI and VCP through the Chu-mango value chain in Dong Thap Province during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness from stakeholders and encourage value chain thinking to improve performance. This result may pave the way for relevant policymakers to look for policies and strategies for better inclusiveness of stakeholders to show the importance of the VCI in improving the performance. Moreover, the study is an empirical case contributing to the agribusiness value chain in a developing country; it applies the agribusiness value chain of the tropical fruit domain and can be used for other agricultural products in other cases of unexpected risks. © 2021.

    abstract = {Major changes are taking place in the Chinese countryside. Long a smallholder dominant economy with small and fragmented farms, a suite of policies, regulations, and financial instruments are being mobilised to drive larger-scale, more commercialised, and more industrialised farming in China. Larger operators such as “dragon-head” agribusinesses are transforming production and supply chains, while the operational rights and titles over farmland are being formalised so that smallholders can more easily transfer their land to large-scale producers. This article aims to deepen our understanding of the extent and nature of land transfer in China by exploring its dynamics in inland provinces. It draws on a 2019 survey of more than 900 cash-cropping farms in four provinces (Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei and Yunnan), semi-structured interviews, and secondary data. Our mixed methods approach supports in-depth analysis of the extent and dynamics of land transfer in apple, tea, orange and coffee-growing areas. We find that in contrast to national statistics, land transfer from smallholders to other operators is generally quite limited, a finding which highlights the ongoing viability of specialised smallholder farming and other site-specific barriers to scaling up. In the site where land transfer is most extensive, it is being driven by a state-agribusiness-cooperative alliance rather than through a newly emerged rural land market. We also find that the nature of leasing out farmland is markedly different to leasing in farmland. Where it occurs, the leasing out of land tends to be organised and formalised, and is tied to state developmentalist goals, particularly poverty alleviation. The leasing in of land is more widespread and occurs on an informal basis. Our analysis highlights key conditions that determine uneven land transfer and confirms that local political-economic dynamics complicate the realisation of central government directives on the ground. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

There is evidence in the literature that inadequate communication between management and cooperative members can be one of the reasons for organizational failure. Inconsistent and ineffective communication can create a disconnect between members and organizations. In addition, communication is an important mechanism capable of improving the commitment of members to the cooperative. Despite this, agricultural cooperatives are slow to incorporate more diverse and effective means of communication to reach their varied audiences. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

Our study fills this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of property rights reform on banks’ capital adequacy in China and heterogeneity across restructured forms of ownership, reform pathways, and time. Using data from rural credit cooperatives in China for 2008–2014, we find that rural cooperative banks have better capital adequacy than banks under two other forms of ownership. We further find that among four possible reform pathways, only restructuring from a rural cooperative bank to a rural commercial bank enhances capital adequacy significantly and that improvements in capital adequacy generally weaken over time. Further analyses indicate that this improvement is primarily attributable to capital injections and removal of non-performing assets by the government. These findings contribute to an understanding of how best to reform rural finance, particularly in developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the effect of vegetable producers' inclusiveness in supply chain coordination on vegetable production performance and potential spillover effect on farm and non-farm income. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive dataset comprised of 410 paired vegetable producers in China is applied. Propensity score matching (PSM) estimation method is used to control for the selection bias problem. Findings: The empirical results indicate that contracting farming does not have significant effect on yield or profit of vegetable production, but promote producers to obtain quality certification. In comparison, cooperative membership has positive effects on the yield, profit and quality certification of producers. Additionally, cooperatives generate positive spillover effects on members' farm and non-farm income, though the results are sensitive to unobserved factors. The inclusion of spillover effects helps to find out the potential unobserved effects which are neglected by most studies and design better policies to promote the development of agricultural companies and farmer cooperatives. Originality/value: First, empirical evidence is provided for theories regarding the roles of different supply chain coordination modes on producers. Second, the analysis on evaluating the effects of supply chain coordination also considers the spillover effect on the farming of other products and even non-farm work of involved producers. Third, a unique dataset comprised of 420 paired vegetable producers, based on an extensive survey is built. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {While the health impact of COVID‐19 in most African countries appears modest, the impact of social distancing measures, closing of markets and reduced mobility is felt across the board. Domestic, labor‐intensive and traditional food value chains and the smallholders they serve appear to be particularly affected. During a systemic shock where idiosyncratic risk coping strategies fail, collective or organizational resilience becomes of the essence to protect the livelihoods of smallholders. In this study, we have used pre‐ and during‐shock data on agricultural cooperatives from Southeast Africa to understand how resilient these smallholder‐owned organizations are. We find that many organizations could not countervail market‐disruptions and fell into a state of dormancy during the pandemic. One reason for this is that collective decision‐making was heavily affected by the banning of gatherings. Only a few organizations devised innovative solutions to maintain the market linkages of rural smallholders. The lack of resilience demonstrated by most cooperatives appears to be associated with organizational immaturity, large membership size, elite capture and limited business‐orientation, which underscore a general lack of managerial capital. © 2021 by the authors.

However, many of the merger processes undertaken fail: some are aborted at the negotiation stage, and others are not approved by members. These failures entail financial and social costs due to frustrated expectations and the time invested in the negotiation process. The objective of this paper is to establish the economic, socio-cultural, organisational and process management factors that underlie this outcome. A survey was conducted among the directors and administrators of a sample of Spanish agri-food cooperatives that had participated in merger processes which were aborted at the negotiation stage or were not approved by their members. Factor and discriminant analyses established the aspects which had the greatest impact on the failure of the merger processes. Far from being economic factors, these analyses reveal that defensive localisms, a lack of commitment to the merger on the part of members and directors, and communication failures were more significant. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {Similar to the number of agricultural cooperatives in the European Union, the number of German wine cooperatives is decreasing. The main purpose of the wine cooperatives is to support the member businesses with the highest possible payouts for their grapes. Wine cooperatives can fulfil this purpose by implementing a differentiation strategy. On the one hand, brands can be used for differentiation. On the other hand, cooperatives can use particular values in the communication with customers that correspond to the target group’s values. Based on the definition of the International Co-operative Alliance, cooperatives are a sustainable form of enterprise. Therefore, the question arises whether it is possible to use sustainability as a value that corresponds to cooperatives as a form of enterprise as well as to a strong societal value that gains importance. Which role does social capital play in the context of social sustainability? The aim of this paper is to shed light on the understanding of brands, to show which cooperative-specific characteristics might pose a challenge to cooperatives in terms of brand management and to examine the understanding of the sustainability construct as well as sustainable management practices applied by wine cooperatives to date.

Results revealed that the overall perception of the respondent contract farm households about the scheme was unfavorable with a weighted mean/index score of ‘2.32ʹ with a mixed perception index score on considered 26 attributes. The study discussed the policy implications of the findings. The main areas of concern are the payment system, the relationship of contract farmers with representatives (from the union, factory, and cooperatives), the income of contract farm households, the provision of services package (like free training, extension services, technical advice), the transparent and comprehensive contract terms and conditions, the provision of basic inputs and production services as per agreement (like adequate land preparation, infield irrigation), the effective and efficient legal framework system, additional support by third parties (on pre and post-harvest, production input provision, basic skill training, and etc.), and both parties should develop trust by having confidence on each other and not by acting opportunistically. © 2021 The Author(s).

    abstract = {Structured abstract: Rendering digital services have taken centerstage in the current ICT for development discourse. E-Government services are mostly under this discourse with the aim to provide citizen centric services in the public domain. Business and development organizations alike are also investing in developing their own digital infrastructure for rendering services to its stakeholders. This case describes scenario in which a cooperative organization wishes to use digital infrastructure and provide digital services to its farmer members. The cooperative continued investing in ICT since the last couple of decades and constantly upgraded it to ease the transaction and bring efficiency and reduce information asymmetry. This had greatly benefitted the members. However, the cooperative is aware that its communication network built on the wireless medium has its own limitations in introducing new services and integrating its databases and applications. The cooperative took note of “Digital India (DI)” initiatives to provide digital services to rural areas and build an ecosystem to empower the citizens in its governance set up. This DI policy has implicit provisions of better networking protocols with improved bandwidth. The organization has a dilemma to continue with investing its own resources or explore possibility of piggybacking on the DI initiative. The cooperative wished to examine the total cost of ownership in either case and assess the feasibility of converging with the infrastructure created by the government. Case synopsis: The Government Information Technology Policies are increasingly favouring citizens and in favour of shared infrastructure and services. It is worth the examination to evaluate strategies to deploy IT infrastructure and services with optimized cost and better returns in an enterprise. This is far more important for a social enterprise like AMALSAD cooperative (user-owned firm) that has deployed its own IT infrastructure and ITeS. AMALSAD cooperative deployed its IT assets long back and in the meanwhile, the Government policy is in favour of providing services over the internet. Leaning objectives: The case serves to help students to understand the theoretical concept of Enterprise information systems infrastructure and services. It brings to the students understanding: the drivers of IT infrastructure to provide digital services; challenges that would make the social enterprise (in this case user-owned firm) to understand the opportunities and challenges of deploying the right digital infrastructure and get services on demand. The case presents the scenarios for the students to deliberate and find answers to the right approach for estimating the total cost of ownership (TCO). Social implications: The case situation presents a scenario for digital government services. Most of the customer-facing enterprises including social enterprises are also providing digital services. It is important that such services converge at an optimized TCO. Complexity academic level: Masters in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems.

    abstract = {Farmer companies (FCs) were a form of farmer-owned firms established in Sri Lanka during the mid-1990s. These have been facilitated by state institutions. Maximization of returns through commercial agriculture has been the main objective of FCs. However, no FCs were operating by the year 2010. This article explains that the institutional facilitation is a strong ingredient in the establishment of FCs in Sri Lanka. This article explainfs how the institutional and governance arrangements of FCs were influenced by the facilitating institutions during the institutional facilitation. It also suggests that institutional facilitation affected the performance of FCs. Six failed FCs were studied. Strategic facilitation was responsible for the performance and sustainability of FCs while operative facilitation provided the basis for direction and operations. Results indicate that poor performance and failure of FCs were due to institutional facilitation that has introduced weak institutional and governance arrangements. There was non-shareholder influence on the Boards of Directors; geographically restricted shareholding; democratic voting rights; and shareholder rights not linked to equity or patronage. Governance problems included voting by the raise of hand; managers not reporting to the Boards directly; shareholders did not elect all the directors. Institutional facilitation of FCs in Sri Lanka has been done by the state facilitating institutions. They have been excessively authoritative on their respective FCs. Therefore, changing the label from cooperatives to companies would not result in better performance. Some recommendations are that facilitating institutions empower FCs through capacity-building; participatory approach in facilitation; remove the geographical restriction in shareholding; install variable shareholding; build capacity of managerial staff; use secret ballots at voting, and practice proportional voting. Understanding the role of facilitating institutions and the dynamics of facilitation would be useful to promote farmer collectives in smallholder farmer dominant developing countries. © 2021 Association of Asia Scholars.},

    abstract = {The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable development Goals (SDG) are a universal commitment to mobilize resources, a challenge for each State to meet its own goals, a new strategy that must rule world development programs, an action plan in favor of people and the planet. They have become a new moral commitment and the map that sets the course of governments, cities, companies, organizations, and citizens in the next ten years. Five years after their launch, the perspectives for meeting these goals by 2030 are uneven. There are critical areas and favorable trends in the international sphere (United Nations, 2019; Sachs et al., 2020); in the Spanish landscape, data is not much different, and there is a need to accelerate their implementation (Castiñeira, 2019; Ruiz & García, 2019; Sánchez et al., 2020). In this context, it is relevant to have indicators to assess and measure the degree of progress of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is also necessary to communicate and make them visible to transform the SDG into an option that allows citizens to choose organizations that offer more sustainable products and services (Silos et al., 2018). Communication is much more than an informative process; it is a management process of the relations between people. When speaking about communication as a space for dialogue and participation, it is necessary to address elements such as identity, perception, and the very action of communication for proper analysis. This article contextualizes current commitment and identification with SDG of companies and organizations; it goes deep into the perceptions and knowledge of citizens of these goals and focuses on SDG communication for social economy organizations. This research’s main objective is to review the contributions of social economy organizations to SDG communication. It departs from a perspective of its development, sensitization, and the raising of awareness towards them. To reach this objective, we start with two hypotheses: The first one, social economy organizations’ communication of the SDG is scarce; the second one, SDG communication, responds to a declarative model versus a participative model. The methodology used was a documentary and content analysis of social economy organizations’ communication of the SDG in Spain. To accomplish this analysis, we examined different representative families and entities of this sector. We tracked web sites, social media sites, studies, and reports from various organizations. We paid particular attention to organizations with greater economic relevance and representation in Spain, according to CEPES (Confederación Empresarial Española de la Economía Social -Spanish Enterprise Confederation for Social Economy). In total, we analyzed social media publications, web sites, and news spaces of close to a hundred companies between January 2018 and mid-September 2020. Additionally, we analyzed activities and published news to examine how SDG and the 2030 agenda were communicated, according to the three proposed tiers in the communication model. The three levels of the communication model are: declarative, where organizations limits to commit in writing or participate in SDG related events without thoroughly implementing the development of these goals within the organization’s policies and defined strategies; informative, where the organization considers developing some of the SDG, inform and offer basic training to its employees and may even produce a report of the achievements in a registry format, and monitors and informs about its progress; and participative, were the members of the organization get involved in the implementation and become the leading prescribers and ambassadors of SDG, and also, the organization participates actively in the diffusion of SDG, with full integration within their communication channels. Finally, the article shows four social economy organization cases representing an excellent example of the communication model’s participation level. Regarding the results obtained, the majority of the hundred organizations analyzed have a web presence. However, their presence in the principal social media networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, is minimal and uneven. Similarly, only a few of the enterprises include SDG references or news on their web sites. The only ones that stand out with information on their websites are the cooperative organizations Cobadu, COPISO, Cajamar, Amiab Group, and Espriú Foundation. Out of 28 organizations associated with CEPES, eleven fluctuate between the communication model’s informative and participative tiers. The ten organizations are the very Spanish Enterprise Confederation for Social Economy (CEPES), CEPES Aragon, Catalunya Cooperative Confederation (Coopcat), Comunitat Valenciana Cooperative Confederation (Concoval), The Spanish Confederation of Consumer and User Cooperatives (Hispacoop), Agro-Alimentary Cooperatives of Spain, Mondragon, Coviran, Federation of Enterprise Associations of Inclusion Enterprises (FAEDEI), Espriú Foundation and Once. The article also analyzes four cases that show the ways a participative communication model may develop. The first case involves Gavina School in Picanya (Valencia), who developed a themed project on human rights and sustainable development goals with students aged 12 to 16 (1º to 4º ESO). Teachers, students, and parents were involved in the initiation and development of the educational project linked to the SDG; the second case also coincides with an academic project from the Sorolla Educational Group. It aimed at raising awareness and spreading the SDG. They produced an environmental project with the educative community’s participation (students, teachers, families, and service personnel). Various external stakeholders (companies and public offices) also participated; the third case involves an agricultural cooperative, Oleocampo, Cooperative Society of Andalucia. Oleocampo is an example of alignment with the 8th SDG creating quality job opportunities, commitment to biomass and edible oil tourism; and the fourth case, where Fruits de Ponent Cooperative includes all 17 SDG in their daily activities and produces sustainability reports. Web pages, social media, and sustainability reports are the main windows of communication of any organization with their context. The analysis’s practical conclusions do not show a decisive wager for SDG from Spanish Social Economic organizations. Very few of the organizations leading their sectors have a well-defined communication strategy for SDG. The cases that include references of the SDG have a communication model in the declarative tier, where the commitment barely extends to the organization’s members or towards society. Nevertheless, this does not mean that there is no concern or they are not working, but they are not communicating. Social Economy Organizations have in their origins SDG specific values, where people, context, and cooperation are fundamental. These values represent an opportunity we can not miss. It is necessary to continue communicating the SDG, communication must be action, and with a time frame of 10 years ahead, there is still much work citizens can do. Social economy organizations are better positioned to influence sustainability and SDG since they have good identity values to be the transmission belt of these goals. This research also shows the opportunity these organizations have to take the lead. It is a landscape of slow processes, where some goals lay far ahead. Social economy organizations have a chance to communicate their philosophy, values, and alignment with the SDG and the 2030 agenda. © 2021 CIRIEC-España},

    abstract = {Farmer groups are the cornerstone of many agricultural projects in low income countries. The success of such projects crucially depends on the ability of group members to cooperate. We conducted a series of public goods experiments to study within-group cooperation in Malawian farmer groups. We combine results from these experiments with survey data and qualitative interviews. Our results shed light on the heterogeneous capacity of groups to cooperate. We find that democratically run groups, in particular those with close social ties, are more cooperative compared to groups with leader-driven decision-making. Focus groups indicate that this democracy is deliberative in nature, characterized by open discussion that aggregates preferences, increases common knowledge, and creates goodwill. A second set of experiments in which we experimentally vary the decision-making processes yields quantitatively similar results in arbitrary groupings of farmers and null results in pre-existing groups with established decision-making procedures, demonstrating the stickiness of institutional rules. Our results imply that group formation and functioning needs to be included in the design phase of agricultural projects in low income countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Agricultural land conversion (ALC) and agricultural land abandonment (ALA) have a direct relationship with different economic, social, and environmental issues. The change in land management and land use, in addition to economic and social effects, has a major impact on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil, quantity and quality of water resources, and air quality. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the drivers of abandoning agricultural lands in Sanandaj county in Iran using a structural equation modeling method. A systematic random sampling method was followed by a proportionate strategy for the selection of 351 samples from a total of 4500 farmers. Data were collected through a questionnaire developed during a comprehensive literature review. The results showed that the causes of ALA can be categorized into five drivers: economic, social, political, agro-technical, and managerial-legal ones. These drivers have a two-way relationship, both direct and indirect, with each other. According to the farmers' views, the most effective cause of ALA was managerial-legal with a factor loaded value of 0.79. The most important issues in the legal-managerial factor were lack of a strong and efficient land use management for lands around cities, inhibition of land fragmentation Act during the legacy after the culmination of Iran's revolution in 1978, purchasing agricultural lands around the city for housing construction purposes, the problem of segmented farms, and not paying enough attention to establish and enforce agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, better support of legal management issues about agricultural lands leads to better control of land use change (LUC). © 2021},

This article uses a survey of 6,000 households in Nepal, a developing economy, to enhance understanding of the factors driving solar-system uptake by households. A key contribution is the breadth of analysis. We find important influences for economic, social, and locational factors. In contrast, physical dwelling aspects, such as roof material, appear to be less important. Social influences explain extra variation in solar-panel uptake, when comparing social and economic influences, although some variables could be classified in multiple categories. For example, membership in a women’s saving and credit cooperative is a socioeconomic factor that is associated with greater solar-panel adoption. Socioeconomic factors may be the most important for future policy innovations, given that existing policy already focuses on location. For instance, this article finds that solar adoption has been much higher in the most supported regions for the Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It demonstrates, first, how in espousing gradualism and pacifism, in stressing the significance of education and meditation as agents of social change, in seeking to construct intentional communities in the here and now, as well as build on pre-existing examples of ‘anarchy in action’ such as consumer and producer cooperatives, in taking a measured view of the state, not rejecting the institution on principle, but only its coercive form, and in making sex central to his vision of utopia as an essential ingredient of a happy and sustainable life, Huxley anticipated the ‘new’ anarchism of the postwar era. Second, it argues that, in rejecting notions of ‘normal’ subjectivity, in seeing the human subject as fundamentally irrational, in viewing power as coextensive with society itself, as a relationship that can only be managed as opposed to abolished, in repudiating grand theory or metanarratives in favour of ‘micro-politics’, and in viewing science as both epistemologically flawed and potentially oppressive, Huxley anticipated postanarchism.

    abstract = {The European small ruminants (i.e. sheep and goats) farming sector (ESRS) provides economic, social and environmental benefits to society, but is also one of the most vulnerable livestock sectors in Europe. This sector has diverse livestock species, breeds, production systems and products, which makes difficult to have a clear vision of its challenges through using conventional analyses. A multi-stakeholder and multi-step approach, including 90 surveys, was used to identify and assess the main challenges for the sustainability of the ESRS to prioritize actions. These challenges and actions were identified by ESRS experts including farmers, cooperatives, breeding associations, advisers and researchers of six EU countries and Turkey. From the 30 identified challenges, the most relevant were economy-related challenges such as ‘uncertainty of meat and milk prices’, ‘volatility of commodity prices’, ‘low farm income’, ‘high subsidy dependency’ and ‘uncertainty in future changes in subsidies’ resulting in ‘a sector not attractive to young farmers’. Most of these challenges were beyond the farmer's control and perceived as difficult to address. Challenges were prioritized using an index, calculated by multiplying the relevance and the feasibility to address measures. The identified challenges had a similar priority index across the whole sector with small differences across livestock species (sheep vs goats), type of products (meat vs dairy) and intensification levels (intensive vs semi-intensive vs extensive). The priorities were different, however, between socio-geographical regions (Southern vs Central Europe). Some of the top prioritized challenges were linked to aspects related to the production systems (‘low promotion of local breeds’ and ‘slow adaptability of high producing breeds’) and market practices (‘unfair trade/lack of traceability’). The majority of the priority challenges, however, were associated with a deficient knowledge or training at farm level (‘poor business management training’, ‘lack of professionalization’, ‘slow adoption of innovations’), academia (‘researchers do not address real problems’) and society as a whole (‘low consumer education in local products’, ‘low social knowledge about farming’, ‘poor recognition of farming public services’). Thus, improved collaboration among the different stakeholders across the food chain with special implication of farmers, associations of producers, academia and governments is needed to facilitate knowledge exchange and capacity building. These actions can contribute to make ESRS economically more sustainable and to adapt the production systems and policy to the current and future societal needs in a more region-contextualized framework. © 2020 The Authors},

The performance of the cooperatives was analysed through in-depth interviews with officers of the Malaysian Co-operative Societies Commission (MCSC).

The preliminary results suggest that inactive single mother co-operatives are higher than those active ones. This study found that 61% of the total single mother co-operatives in Peninsular Malaysia are inactive (dormant and non-operational) compared to 39% active ones. Four influencing factors contribute to a higher percentage of inactive co-operatives: limited resources, dependence on subsidies and sponsors, managerial incompetency, and member participation. The results suggest solutions for the management of single mother co-operatives and provide additional information and contribution to the parties involved to empower the association to fulfil the economic, social, and cultural requirements. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of propensity score matching technique and sample selection stochastic frontier framework that addresses potential selection bias due to observable and unobservable attributes is used to estimate the effect of participation between cooperative members and non-members. Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated and compared. Findings: The empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates that cooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantly associated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, total farmland, distance to market and geographic location). Practical implications: The findings of this study demonstrate that cooperative organisations can be an important tool to enhance the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers. Successful cooperative models together with training programs designed to enlighten farmers on the importance and tangible benefits of collective action should be used to enlarge participation in cooperative organisations. In addition, governments and development agencies should implement targeted investment and capacity building programs related to irrigation management, gender-sensitive awareness and development of the internal institutional mechanisms in cooperatives for the transfer of knowledge and mutual learning so that all members benefit from cooperatives. Originality/value: Despite the pervasive evidence of the impact of cooperatives on productivity and technical efficiency in the Asian region, this study is probably the first attempt in the crop sector in Mongolia. It provides a rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency through a counterfactual design. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {In contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, rural poverty is an unresolved issue, despite farming having been a poverty coping strategy for many rural dwellers, especially after the end of the Balkan war. Eradicating poverty is among the priorities of the national government that aims at EU candidacy and accession. Being the most dynamic among agricultural sectors, berry farming is a key agricultural activity at the national level and had been the subject of rural development interventions, including the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. This article provides evidence from the largest agricultural cooperative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to inform decision making and policy planning. The article aims at describing and analyzing the status and dynamics of poverty at the farm household level while highlighting their contributing factors, as well as at proposing possible development strategies based on the voice of local actors. Given the complexity and multifaceted features of the investigated issues, the methodological approach of this study relies on a mixed-methods research design, where the quantitative findings from the analysis of poverty status and dynamics and their contributing factors are complemented by qualitative findings from participatory activities. The results of the study pinpoint the successful contribution of the cooperative to the improvement of farmers' working conditions and market access and suggest that supporting collective action among berry farmers can be an effective rural development intervention to alleviate rural poverty and prevent poverty fallouts. To date, structural characteristics of farm holdings and households and climate and market-related conditions have significantly contributed to the farmers' poverty as well as to farmers’ exposure to poverty. Furthermore, bridging the gender gap is still a challenge in Bosnia and Herzegovina which should be addressed urgently to mitigate the problem of social exclusion and to promote bottom-up innovation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

They foster local economic development by mobilizing deposits and lending these out to individuals, families, farmers, and small businesses in the same area. Using balanced panel data of 457 RuSACCOs from Ethiopia over the period 2014–17, we show how deposit mobilization affects technical efficiency. Our first stage efficiency estimate by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Window model shows the average efficiency of RuSACCOs gradually increased over time. The second stage Tobit censored estimation and bootstrapped truncated regression results confirms our hypotheses for key and control variables effects on technical efficiency. Focusing on rapid expansion during the early life cycle affects technical efficiency. A high percentage of women membership in cooperative enterprises advances technical efficiency. Furthermore, attracting and including all segments of the local entrepreneurial class as a membership opens the possibilities for mobilizing more deposits to become efficient. © 2020 The Authors.

    abstract = {Despite the purposeful governmental programs, agricultural cooperation in Russia is not developing—on the contrary, the number of cooperatives has been continuously declining. This study investigates the reasons for farmers' refusal to join cooperatives. A prepared questionnaire was distributed in one of the Russian regions (the Republic of Tatarstan), and the collected data were analyzed via the cross tabulation method and logit analysis. According to the study results, the major reasons for not cooperating are as follows: respondent farmers lack the experience of cooperation, they have problems trusting each other, they are not socially active in their communities, and they rarely have a higher education. The study results recommend that the Ministry of Agriculture, willing to develop agricultural cooperation, pay special attention to educating farmers in terms of cooperation. Particular work should be done in teaching farmers to work in groups, trust each other, and organize systems of cooperative ventures in a way that would exclude cheating and free-riding behavior on the parts of both the cooperative members and the leaders. Stimulating social activities among farmers in rural areas might also increase cooperation. In addition, there is a need for agricultural consulting services offering high quality educational courses explaining the advantages of cooperatives and profits that they may provide to the members. © 2021.

Open code includes 34 concepts and core code includes 4 major categories, including cost reduction, product quality enhancement, innovation and continuous improvement. Agricultural development was identified as the central criterion of the present study. In order to understand the experiences of growers in their own language, semi-structured interviews were conducted to provide solutions to develop pistachio agriculture and create a competitive situation. Thus, the interviews begin with general questions and are followed by the solutions of each grower. The interview questions are designed to transfer technical knowledge of the interviewees and achieve solutions in order to benefit from knowledge management in the development of pistachio agriculture in Iran. The findings of this study helps the presentation of strategies to develop agriculture and maintain the position of Iranian pistachio growers in competitive markets that will lead to greater profits. According to our research, establishing a powerful cooperative system could satisfy growers’ requirements and will lead to an expansion of agriculture in Iran. Additionally, our system could result into establish a more proactive farming society using knowledge management. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

    abstract = {This study aims to investigate the interdependence between gainsharing and performance evaluation (objective and subjective) in a credit union. There is a recent debate on the interdependence between management control practices, which emerges from the discussion of control packages or systems. This study delves into this discussion by investigating the complementarity between gainsharing (group incentive modality) and performance evaluation in a credit union context, given the need for qualitative empirical studies on this phenomenon. This study is considered relevant because the joint use of management control practices can allow organizations to effectively mitigate control problems such as lack of direction, motivation, and competence. This research promotes insights into management control practices’ operation – given the discussion of complementarity between gainsharing, which is not a prevalent incentive system in most organizations – and objective and subjective performance evaluation. The methodology consists of a qualitative field study in a credit union using data collection, interviews, and access to documents analyzed using an interpretive approach. This research presents evidence on the phenomenon of interdependence between management control practices, adding to the literature by addressing different forms of complementarity between a group incentive system in the form of gainsharing and performance evaluation. It became evident that gainsharing reinforces the objective performance evaluation process by mitigating motivation and direction problems, while the subjective performance evaluation compensates the objective performance evaluation by shifting the focus of the evaluation to the individual’s skills. © 2021 Universidade de Sao Paulo.

Design/methodology/approach: Through a presentation of four narrative cases, the paper exemplifies international experiences of co-operative approaches to place-making. It critically reflects on the philosophical and strategic underpinnings of the projects implemented in Rochdale, Preston, Bologna, Rome and Cincinnati. Findings: The practical experiences of a number of local projects of place-making involving co-operatives are conceptualised. The research has identified the importance of institutional, organisational and legal constraints for transformative cooperative-based place-making initiatives. It shows a strong relevance of the place’s historic legacy and communal governance for the choice of place-making approaches. Research limitations/implications: Further investigation is needed to establish whether co-operatives have the same driving force potential in terms of local regeneration and community wealth building place-making in non-Western contexts and less developed locations. Practical implications: The paper highlights cases that incorporate place-making practices involving the co-operative organisation and municipal participation and considers their transferability potential. Originality/value: The paper advances an important conversation relevant to researchers, educators, co-operators, politicians and local officials on diverse contemporary approaches in towns and cities that seek to reshape and regenerate local socio-economic fabric by engaging tradition, principles and organisation models developed within the co-operative movement. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {When the British colonial government took over Tanzania, colonial officials championed and encouraged the inhabitants in Kilimanjaro to grow coffee along with settlers. The authorities gave priority to the local smallholders, relegating settlers to a minor role within colonial agriculture and the coffee economy in particular. This generated a vigorous protest among the settlers against the government policy. The tension would bring a number of remarkable developments, including the establishment of the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association (KNPA) and, later, the promulgation of legislation regulating coffee farming and marketing via cooperatives, such as the Co-operative Societies Ordinance No. 7 of 1932 and the Native Coffee Control Ordinance No 26 of 1937. This paper examines the interlocked dimensions and intricacies related to the coffee industry policies, and their impact on agricultural policies in Kilimanjaro region as well as across the country. In particular, the paper discusses how the settlers' opposition influenced the promulgation of segregative, monopolistic and protectionist legislations, and the role of control Boards in this process. To do so, this paper relies on existing literature as well as underutilized primary sources obtained from the Tanzania National Archives (TNA) in Dar es Salaam. © 2021 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System},

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was developed based on a literature review, and a quantitative study was conducted, including a representative sample of the current most prominent Spanish agrifood cooperatives. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the validity of constructs, path relationships and recent advances in the predictive model assessment. Findings: This study’s findings show the specific role of human capital (HC) for enhancing social and structural capital in cooperatives.

    abstract = {Smallholder commercialization is central to international development policy and prac-tice. As a result, several arrangements to foster market linkages are being implemented. Especially popular are farmers’ organizations, which are believed to be owned, controlled, and financed by smallholders. As such, their design is considered inclusive given every household in a community is theoretically allowed to become a member, and the governance and management structure encourage participatory decision-making. However, even in the context in which farmers’ organizations are actively promoted, a notable proportion of smallholders may not be able to engage in market-oriented production or may opt for the existing alternative marketing arrangements, as dictated by individual households’ socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on the case of smallholder farming in Olenguruone, Nakuru county, Kenya, where a donor funded dairy farmers’ cooperative marketing arrangement is promoted alongside existing marketing opportunities, the present research investigated the factors that determine smallholders’ commercial farming orientation and marketing arrangements. It employed a case study approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods for a more complete empirical inquiry. The findings demonstrate that irrespective of the external support provided through marketing opportunities such as farmer organizations, smallholders’ engagement in commercial farming and marketing is dictated by the socioeconomic attributes and market perceptions that are heterogeneous among households in a smallholder community. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {Agro-food supply chain integration (ASCI) plays a growingly important role in the stable and sustainable development of agriculture. However, it is challenging for core firms to integrate the small-scale and scatted farmers due to complex transaction processes and volatile relationships in China. Agricultural co-operatives are organizations that unite farmers’ power and help them achieve economic benefits. Our research focuses on ASCI from the perspective of co-operatives. A comprehensive cooperative framework, including trinity co-operatives and trinity federations, is conducted to figure out the position and process of agricultural co-operatives in ASCI, while QCA provides detailed collaborative patterns for agricultural co-operatives to adopt. Results show that agricultural co-operatives can achieve high economic and social/environmental performance when participating in ASCI. This study further completes the ASCI literature and offers many managerial and academic implications to co-operatives’ members and policy-makers. © 2021 Zhang et al.

    abstract = {Purpose: Driven by scientific and technological intensification, Brazilian agribusinesses are among the main food producers and exporters worldwide. Knowledge management contributes to the development of agribusinesses. The objective of this study is to analyze knowledge management practices in the supply chain of broilers at the level of farmers and compare the differences between farmers who are members of cooperatives, and those who are suppliers of firms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a sample of broiler farmers (n = 240, where 80 respondents are associated with cooperatives) from Brazil, descriptive statistics were used to measure the four knowledge management dimensions (leadership, people, process and technology). The Mann–Whitney test was performed to verify the difference in the adoption of knowledge management practices between farmers who are members of cooperatives, and those who are suppliers of firms. Findings: The results showed significant differences between the analyzed groups of broiler farmers that are members of an agricultural cooperative and suppliers of firms. Farmers who supply firms adopt knowledge management practices with greater intensity. They are also more technified and have a larger scale of production. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in a single agribusiness chain. Future studies may look at another method of knowledge management assessment to see if the results will be similar. Practical implications: The results can contribute to the development of programs and policies, incorporating knowledge management into agribusiness as a competitive strategy. Originality/value: While knowledge management is a widely studied topic, there has been little focus on this subject with regard to agribusiness. Empirical findings of an important agribusiness supply chain are provided and show the differences in knowledge management perceptions between farmers who are members of cooperatives and those who are suppliers of firms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The study used a disproportionate stratified sampling method, with 308 valid samples collected from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the districts and the Management Boards of ACs in 9 provinces in MD. Performance of AC is measured against five indicators, namely return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), responsiveness to cooperative members’ needs, and generation of jobs. Multivariate regression method was used for data analysis. The estimated results identified four factors that are positively correlated with cooperatives’ performance (namely management competency; contributed capital; membership size; and members’ participation) while indicating interaction between independent variables (management competency and contributed capital; management competency and membership size) in the relationship to performance of co-operatives. The study findings showed that the degree of influence of management competency on performance of cooperatives in fruit tree farming is always higher compared with those in rice farming. In addition, a number of recommendations are proposed to help the ACs’ management boards make appropriate improvements to the support policy and performance evaluation indicators of the cooperatives. Cooperatives should also innovate in the use and optimization of resources. © Author(s) 2022.},

    abstract = {This paper examines how credit unions manage accountability to government in the lightly-regulated context of Indonesia. Adopting a qualitative methodology involving a case study approach, two credit unions are examined, through focus group discussions with credit union management and review of credit unions’ annual reports and strategic plans. Findings reveal few formal compliance-based accountability mechanisms in relation to government, and limited emphasis on these mechanisms by credit unions. However, informally, credit unions involved government in various strategic ways to demonstrate accountability and legitimacy, and seek support from them, thereby managing the regulatory space to maintain a lightly-regulated context. This paper provides insights into how credit unions adopted a predominantly co-operative approach to manage and negotiate a space of limited regulation by actively demonstrating legitimacy and accountability. Presented in the form of an engagement pyramid involving four levels (i.e. compliance, self-regulation within the sector, engaging with regulators, and selectively challenging regulation perceived as unfair or unhelpful), this approach is particularly important given the seemingly less effective regulatory frameworks in more developed countries. It provides a reference for other organisations, both within the third sector and beyond, to consider how their actions might respond to and constructively shape the regulatory space, beyond comply or evade. © 2021 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.},

    abstract = {This paper investigates whether and how financial and administrative controllers of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor (MOSAL) decrease agency costs in consumer cooperative societies (co-ops) in Kuwait. It hypothesizes that MOSAL controllers are effective monitors in reducing agency costs. The study employs a multivariate regression model and calculates the t-values using Roger's robust standard errors, correcting for co-op clusters due to the potential cross-sectional correlation and autocorrelation of the error terms to test a sample of 929 observations for 59 consumer cooperative societies from 2000–2018. The empirical results support the hypothesis. Further tests show that low-performing co-ops have lower agency costs. However, the presence of the financial and administrative controllers has no effect on agency costs in high-performing co-ops. Also, the effect that MOSAL controllers have on agency costs varies among co-ops. This study complements a line of research on co-op governance and adds to the empirical evidence on the association of corporate governance and agency costs. It also helps understand how regulators influence management and board discretion to safeguard co-op shareholder rights. Further, it explores an important sector and analyzes a unique, comprehensive, and rarely tested dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We develop a model of 'mixed credit markets' where pure for-profit institutions (e.g. commercial banks) can coexist with financial NPOs which feature a concern for inter-member surplus redistribution (e.g. credit cooperatives) and enjoy privileged borrower-specific information vis-à-vis their for-profit peers, while facing higher funding costs. We formally investigate market competition between the two alternative financial organizations both offering contracts whose terms entail cross subsidization. We argue that heterogeneity in organizational models can explain stable coexistence under competitive conditions, and also help us interpret the variety of market outcomes - in terms of e.g. overall coverage and market shares - as documented in modern financial systems. Importantly, the viability of redistribution-oriented NPOs is shown not to rest on under-investment issues or concerns about market power, for they can successfully operate in markets where credit rationing never arises. © 2021 Marcello D'Amato et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2021.},

    abstract = {Malian farmers’ traditional system for managing seed of sorghum, an indigenous crop of vital importance for food security and survival, can be conceptualized as a commons. Although this system maintains a wide range of varieties and helps ensure access to seed, its ability to create and widely disseminate new varieties to meet evolving opportunities and challenges is limited. A network of farmer groups, public breeding programs, and development organizations collaborating in decentralized creation and dissemination of sorghum varieties in Mali is examined regarding (1) how the network developed and what activities it conducts; (2) the resulting varietal diversity, varietal performance and organizational models; and (3) the elements of the traditional seed system that were maintained, strengthened or transformed. A single-case study approach was used that relies on published literature, official catalogues of released varieties and a database of farmer seed-cooperative requests for foundation seed. The functioning of the network and its varietal-, seed-, and organizational- outcomes are documented and the elements of the traditional sorghum seed system that are maintained or strengthened are analyzed. The evolution of the network’s reliance on commoning as a social process and its strengthening of core Seed Commons features are discussed with a view to the network’s contributions to targeted development outcomes and potential replicability. The case demonstrates how creating a framework for collaboration, enabling actors and organizations to take on collective responsibility while maintaining distributed decision-making at local level, opens opportunities for transforming farming- and food-systems towards sustainability and resilience. © 2020, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {In places where state has been historically the most dominant actor of all reforms, it can be particularly challenging to develop non-state forms of organization and governance such as agricultural cooperatives known to reduce transaction costs and utilize economies of scale. This paper explores the latest state policy on the development of agricultural cooperatives in Uzbekistan through the prism of its compatibility with the existing institutional conditions. An exploratory case study approach was used to conduct interviews with representatives of key actors involved in the policy formulation at the national scale and its implementation in two pilot provinces. Applying the analytical instruments of the procedure for institutional compatibility assessment (PICA) on the one hand and based on empirical insights from in-depth interviews (n = 22) and internal policy documents on the other hand, we have identified a set of crucial institutional aspects (CIAs) and their relative importance for the establishment of the cooperatives in Uzbekistan. In addition to the incompatibility of an excessively and exclusively regulatory nature of the intervention with the desired voluntary form of cooperatives’ organization, we find that main sources of the policy (in-)compatibility lie within the degrees of information asymmetry, farmers’ trust towards the state, and the capacity of the authorities. Although the state's top-down approach was effective at quickly establishing the cooperatives formally, most farmers were informed about the policy only symbolically, who then remained largely skeptical about its value, and considered the state responsible for its implementation. The findings highlight the need for a change in broader institutional environment and allowing time for learning and internalization of self-organization principles by farmers in order to make the economic advantages of cooperatives possible. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors that affect the Canadian credit unions' financial performance which play an important role in providing financial services to the agriculture sector. Design/methodology/approach: We surveyed the literature to identify different performance metrics of credit unions and a set of possible factors that might affect their performance. We collected data related to different dependent and independent variables from financial statements and balance sheets of 189 credit unions and from general websites like Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada. Then, we imputed the missing data and developed fixed effect and random effect panel data regression models. First, we used return on asset as the main dependent variable. Afterwards, we used six performance metrics to check the robustness of our models. Findings: From an initial list of 16 possible factors that might affect the financial performance of a credit union, we were able to narrow the factors down to the nine most significant ones. It was observed that credit unions in the prairies were more likely to perform well financially as compared to other provinces. Membership size, the size of a credit union in terms of total assets, capital adequacy ratio, market penetration, diversification of income, inflation rate and provincial GDP and interest rates were significant. The cross-sectional analysis performed confirmed the findings of the fixed effect panel data models. Research limitations/implications: This study has a limitation concerning the number of years included into the time series analysis. Only ten years worth of data were available. Practical implications: Results provide credit union management, service providers for credit unions and market analysts with a current understanding of how different internal and external factors might affect return on assets, return on equity, delinquency, cash ratio, efficiency ratio, asset growth and loan growth. Our models can be used to predict financial performance of credit unions based on the defined significant variables. Originality/value: Although there is a wide body of literature that studies performance of banks, not many studies focus on credit unions. Moreover, the existing studies are based on credit unions in United States or Europe, and literature on Canadian credit unions is scarce. The data collected covered 189 Canadian credit unions. To our knowledge this is the first study that looks at the various internal, external and regulatory factors together that affect the credit unions in various jurisdictions of Canada. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

They account for approximately half of agricultural trade in the EU. By contrast, in the EU Western countries, where farmer cooperatives are widespread and successful, agricultural cooperation in Lithuania has developed intermittently in the last century. We still have very limited knowledge of why the country’s agricultural producers (especially smallholder farmers) are reluctant to cooperate in Lithuania. The aim of this study is to assess the level of the willingness to cooperate among smallholder farmers in Lithuania and to draw up the profiles of small-scale farms that participate in and intend to join cooperatives and, conversely, that do not participate in cooperatives and do not intend to do so. To achieve this goal, a representative survey of small-scale farms was conducted. Results of surveys carried out in 2019 in Lithuania on a group of 1002 small-scale farms showed that only 8% of the surveyed farms participate in producer groups or cooperatives, while another 8% intend to participate. Small-scale farms in Lithuania have weak market integration, with no bargaining power on input and output markets. The vast majority of small-scale farms are reluctant to participate in cooperative activities in Lithuania. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the profile of a small farm that tends to cooperate. The main social characteristics of farm managers and economic factors of farms willing to cooperate have been identified. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

    abstract = {This article, building on the 5th principle of the Statement of the Cooperative Identity explores the practice of co-educating and learning behavior among the members of a dairy cooperative society. The study adopts a social network approach by focusing on two relational social ties: information sharing and advice-seeking. Building on a case of a 55-year-old dairy cooperative in India, the social network analysis finds information-sharing relations among members to be inclusive, with no members isolated, and information exchanged along formal and knowledge hierarchies. Likewise, information sharing is horizontal, with information smoothly exchanged even among new and already established members, as is the transfer of leadership roles from the older members of the cooperatives to the younger members. Advice-seeking networks tend to be a bit more centralized toward board members and members exerting day-to-day leadership because of their knowledge and expertise regarding the organization and its policies. Our analysis suggests inclusive information sharing among members and a well-structured and functioning advice and knowledge-sharing network that contributes to learning of the cooperative members. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Loan book management is important to community credit union survival, particularly in deprived localities. Consistent with agency theory, prior studies of credit unions report an association among individual monitoring mechanisms, trade association monitoring, and female board representation, respectively, and reduced loan losses. This study provides a more nuanced understanding by investigating the moderating influence of these monitoring mechanisms on the relationship between loan losses and deprivation and by considering the effect of bundle combinations of different levels of the two monitoring mechanisms on loan losses. The results reveal that credit unions subject to trade association monitoring have the lowest loan losses. However, in the absence of trade association monitoring, female board representation has a moderating effect on loan losses as deprivation increases. Finally, trade association monitoring and female board representation have a substitutive, rather than a complementary effect on loan losses. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Information was collected through mixed method research, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected via interview from 30 knowledgeable experienced stakeholders of Thai co-operatives, with information recorded for later analysis. Quantitative data were collected via a survey involving 300 co-operative organisations from seven categories of enterprise, taking relevant samples, and was analysed together with the data from interviews with member stakeholders. Analysis also utilised descriptive statistics, namely: frequency, percentages, averages, and standard deviation. Results revealed that Thai co-operatives were in compliance with all seven principles to a reasonably high standard in the following order of statistical significance: 2nd (highest), 7th, 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th (lowest). From these findings, it is recommended that Thai co-operative leaders strive for continued improvements, developing higher standards and consistency among their members and staff to achieve greater parity with the International Principles and the worldwide co-operative business community. This can be facilitated through better education, extension of knowledge, personal development, and encouragement for staff and members. It is also suggested that the government provide additional support for co-operatives in working together to achieve a common goal. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

    abstract = {The study describes the ownership and governance characteristics and the challenges of farmer-based cooperative societies from three districts in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 59 active and 14 inactive cooperatives in the selected districts. The study concludes that Ghanaian cooperatives in the sample bear much resemblance to the traditional form which emerged in Europe and North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Generally, such cooperatives have relatively small memberships from local communities who use a democratic governance system and do not delegate control to outsiders. While the cost of owning and transacting is limited with such characteristics, many traditional cooperatives lack the specific knowledge, economic efficiency, and resource endowment necessary to become or remain competitive. Indeed, the active cooperatives listed finance, access to inputs, tractor services and poor leadership as key challenges, while inactive cooperatives blamed poor member commitment as the primary culprit for their inactivity. Efforts aimed at promoting and supporting farmer cooperatives should focus on addressing these key challenges. Also, financial and technical support should probably be conditional on group performance and not group formation itself. © 2020 Edgard Milhaud Foundation},

    abstract = {Although economies of scale are relatively well studied in the arts, economies of scope have received less attention. Yet recent trends toward freelancing and technological connectivity make scope economies especially timely in addressing structural challenges to artist-led incubators. This paper offers a conceptual framework for cooperative strategies that employ economies of scope both in the economic sense of joint production and in the financial sense of risk pooling. This framework distinguishes franchise, federation, and resource-sharing organizational structures as developed through case studies of two US-based organizations: ArtBuilt and REC (Resources for Every Creator), placed in a larger context of cooperative organizational strategy in the USA and Europe. The proposed strategies of cooperative networks (quasi-franchises, federations, or resource-sharing networks) also draw on a literature of spatial agglomeration in creative industries. The framework leads to more speculative ideas of “balance-sheet philanthropy” through credit backstopping by foundations, and of novel investment trusts that can be piloted across a range organizations including foundations, grant-makers, artist residency programs, and even for-profit companies engaged in reinsurance. The paper contributes managerial tools and strategies for the creative engagement of capacity building in arts organizations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The objective of this research is to identify institutional factors that can affect agribusiness inclusive models. In this research, agricultural cooperatives of banana production in the province of Magdalena, Colombia, are the unit of analysis to identify institutional factors. The method of review of institutional factors is the multiple cases (six banana cooperatives) with a simple unit using inductive analysis. The results show that institutional factors—both formal (certifications, quality standards, social responsibility policies and economic incentives) and informal (cooperation, improvement of quality of life, generation of social capital)—promote the development of inclusive businesses in cooperatives of the base of the pyramid. The research is a first step to show its potential replication in other agricultural industries and even in other economic sectors. © 2021 Institute of Rural Management, Anand, Gujarat, India.},

The REDD+ activities for conserving carbon stored in forests to reduce GHG emissions and to enhance the carbon sink function of forests are expected to serve as an important means for achieving the climatic goal. In this study, a set of criteria was devised to assess the REDD+ Measuring, Reporting, and Verifying (MRV) implementation capabilities of developing countries, which was applied to analyze the REDD+ MRV levels in REDD+ countries. Based on the Forest Reference Emission Level/Forest Reference Level (FREL/FRL), National Strategy (NS), National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) and Safeguard Information Summary (SIS) the countries submitted, 36 REDD+ countries submitted only the FREL/FRL (Group I), while 5 countries fulfilled the WRF requirements and registered REDD+ reduction results (Group II), and 6 received Results-Based Payments (RBP) (Group III). From longest to shortest, the periods for which the International Fund provided support were arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, verifying the relative importance of international support. From highest to lowest, the overall MRV capability was also arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, although Group I or Group II was at a higher level than the other groups in some elements. REDD+ countries in the Readiness Phase (Group I) would aim to have the MRV capabilities of Groups II and III to receive RBP, and international support for REDD+ MRV capacity building could enable them to do. However, in addition to the receipt of RBP, REDD+ should be reflected in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as consistent reduction results at the national GHG inventory level, and the advancement of REDD+ MRV is expected to be a necessary and sufficient condition for REDD+ cooperation under the Paris Agreement cooperative approach framework. For the following groups, international cooperation is essential. Countries in the Readiness Phase need to be supported with the establishment of an MRV framework, which will enable them to achieve REDD+ to receive RBP and be reflected in NDCs. For REDD+ countries that have thus far met the WRF requirements, the REDD+ scope needs to be upscaled to national levels, and the MRV system should be further advanced to establish a cooperative approach system that can achieve more ambitious reduction targets through forests. © 2021 by the authors.

    abstract = {Short rotation plantations (SRP), also called short rotation coppice, can contribute to bioeconomy by satisfying the rising demand for wood raw material while strengthening the rural economy. However, farmers all over Europe show limited adoption of SRP. Marginal lands are considered a promising option for producing SRP biomass and avoiding conflicts with food production. This study focuses on the Malacky region in Western Slovakia because of suitable land quality and a board production site close by providing a significant local market for the produced biomass. Qualitative interviews in 2018 explored personal and situational factors that influenced local farmers’ (N = 19) willingness to adopt SRP. Slovakia’s land fragmentation in combination with the required landowner’s consent, competition with food production, and lack of identification with SRP were identified as prominent barriers. The economic benefit from using low quality lands and environmental benefits from SRP were identified incentives. Moreover, the study found agricultural cooperatives more open to SRP than agricultural business companies, as they are more interested in the economic benefits and prefer agricultural activity over fallow land. Because the study identified conflicting views about the possible impacts of SRP on the environment and the rural community, it is considered crucial to provide farmers with science-based facts on these issues. This aspect should also be acknowledged to increase acceptance of stakeholders, such as land owners, governmental actors, and the general public, which is needed to develop measures to encourage SRP. © 2021, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {In several Spanish regions, collective action through production and marketing cooperatives has traditionally concentrated the food supply of small and medium-sized farms. However, many cooperatives are threatened by the risk of abandonment of members' cropland, which reduces their sourcing capacity. In this context, joint cropland management initiatives have become a useful form of social and organizational innovation. This research's contribution is twofold: it examines the relevance of some drivers of this organizational innovation, and it determines the cooperative characteristics or combinations of characteristics that can sufficiently explain the adoption of a joint cropland management strategy. Some cooperatives' features have been a priori identified as related to the achievement of joint cropland initiatives: economic size, social innovation, innovative behavior, and collaborative orientation. The study is mainly based on data from a cooperatives survey, and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) methodology has been used. The analysis has been completed by surveying cooperatives' managers about their opinions on a joint cropland management strategy's main advantages and drivers. Results indicate that social and economic innovation, size, and propensity to cooperate with other cooperatives are key factors that help create a cooperative profile capable of tackling the challenge of land abandonment and the consequent loss of production. © 2021},

    abstract = {The sustainable development of cooperatives is essential to agricultural sustainability and is determined mainly by cooperation longevity. The risk sharing and benefit distribution mechanisms are important governance arrangements that affect cooperation longevity in member-heterogeneous cooperatives. However, the relationship between cooperatives’ risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangements and cooperation longevity is not well understood. To address this research gap, we provide a conceptual framework to illustrate the relationship between risk sharing, benefit distribution, contract form and cooperation longevity. By conducting 23 interviews with three dairy cooperatives in China using a multiple-case-study method, we find that cooperation longevity is influenced by the alignment of the combination of risk sharing and benefit distribution for cooperatives and their members. Following the principles of risk-benefit equivalence and strategy-risk preference matching, we discuss four scenarios of match or mismatch of combinations of risk sharing and benefit distribution. We suggest that the government needs to strengthen risk mitigation capabilities for cooperatives and members, and to help them to build an effective risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangement to achieve sustainable development. © 2022 The Author(s).

We find that both voluntary boards and highly-paid boards are more likely to reduce insolvency risk. Board remuneration has two distinct effects on insolvency risk, depending on the size of the credit union. For small credit unions, volunteer boards are associated with less probability of insolvency risk; while for large credit unions, highly paid boards are associated with less probability of insolvency risk. Board diligence is also a significant determinant in reducing insolvency risk in the credit union setting. This study demonstrates the significance of the efficiency wage hypothesis and informs regulatory debate on voluntary boards and board remuneration, around risk oversight. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {Edge-of-fieldwater quality monitoring was conducted in cooperation with private landowners through the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watershed Initiative, a landscape conservation program first offered through the USDA-NRCS in 2010. The study objective was to quantify effectiveness of individual conservation practice or practice combinations on water quality on corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] watersheds. Water samples from northern Missouri farms were collected and analyzed by runoff event for sediment (total suspended solids [TSS]), N, and P to evaluate the effects of crop production, residue types, and conservation land treatment on runoff. The presence of living vegetation in the winter, whether established as a cover crop or cash crop, significantly reduced the sediment loads (p <.0001) and nutrient loads (p ≤.0077). Additional benefits occurred on sites that produced higher residues, like corn or corn with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Significantly low TSS losses occurred during soybean years with corn and winter wheat residues. Sites that implemented full land treatment, having conservation practices that serve to avoid, control, and trap a pollutant, were more effective than those with fewer treatments, especially with respect to P loading. The mean rank for orthophosphates was 45% lower from sites with avoid, control, and trap practices instead of control practices only. Data support the conclusion that conservation structural and management practices are effective and can mitigate some negative impacts generated by agriculture. Although an intricate endeavor, edge-of-field water quality monitoring can serve to complement other forms of environmental analysis and inform landowners about efficient farming practices. © 2021 The Authors.

    abstract = {This article is devoted to the analysis of the effectiveness of the implementation of state agricultural programs, national and priority regional projects to support peasant (farm) farms and rural areas in Sverdlovsk region. Materials and methods: tools and methods of financial assistance, including grants, for peasant (farm) farms in the Sverdlovsk region are analyzed. These mechanisms are used in the implementation of state programs for the development of the agro-industrial complex at the Federal and regional levels. The identified problems of agricultural development allow us not only to formulate recommendations for improving the mechanisms for implementing measures to support farmers, but also to pay attention to aspects that are not taken into account by state programs. The authors relied on statistical, structural, analytical, system, logical, and correlation analysis. The normative legal basis of the study was chosen by the normative legal acts of Russian Federation and Sverdlovsk region, including state programs, national and priority regional projects implemented in the field of agriculture, and official materials of state statistics. Results: the effectiveness of the main instruments of state support for farmers in the region is evaluated, recommendations for improving the mechanisms of support for farmers in Sverdlovsk region are developed, and directions for the development of rural cooperation are proposed. Discussion: the article presents a socio-economic analysis of the support and development of peasant (farm) farms by the state government authorities of Sverdlovsk region. The authors pay special attention to the fact that during the implementation of state programs and projects, certain aspects are not taken into account when evaluating applications for state funding, which were identified by researchers in Estonia and Latvia. Conclusion: it is necessary to regularly assess the effectiveness and then correlate the tools used to support peasant (farm) farms. In order to increase efficiency, it is necessary to apply correlation analysis of statistical data to public authorities and conduct sociological research (in the future). © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

    abstract = {The Social and Solidarity Economy in the urban environment of Mexico City was expanded from the conditions of unemployment and labor precariousness generated by liquid modernity from its beginnings. The search for labor stability necessarily takes us back to the times of the Welfare State, which contributed to the construction of a sense of community in the urban environment. The objective of this research was to analyze proximity or distance to the characteristics of work in the liquid and solid modernity and the Social and Solidarity Economy of small family cooperatives in Mexico City. The questions to be answered in this article are: Are the working conditions that were present in the Welfare State the same as those proposed to be achieved by the Social and Solidarity Economy? And, being two different theoretical frameworks, what then are the particularities of work in the Social and Solidarity Economy? The research methodology was mixed, quantitative for the selection of cooperatives that met two requirements: appropriate cooperative management and economic viability, this was done through a discriminant analysis, a multivariate statistical technique. The database used to perform the discriminations was that of the 2015 “Economic Diagnosis on Cooperativism of the Federal District”, with 192 cooperatives representative at 90% confidence of 1,589. The methodology was developed in detail in Luvián, Rosas, and Ramírez (2019) from the crossings resulted in 22 cooperatives with the economic viability and 130 with appropriate cooperative management, from which 12 cooperatives were reached that met both criteria. However, for reasons of accessibility, only eight could be interviewed. The qualitative methodology considered the theoretical approach to determine the categories of analysis and thematic axes of the interviews: capital-labor, space-time, and community and individual. The principles for internal management were taken from cooperativism: democratic control, democratic participation, and autonomy and independence; with emphasis on democracy through the organization chart (General Assembly, Board of Directors, and Supervisory Board). The interviews were applied to the legal representatives of the cooperatives. The responses were analyzed employing the categorization method to process the text of the interviews through categories and subcategories and thus present through words or short phrases the similarities and differences of the interviewees through the themes and components of the topic. The categories were organized through networks with the Atlas ti.8 software, examining mainly aspects such as the basis and density of the networks with the co-occurrence method. The results show that cooperatives present stability conditions like those existing in solid modernity such as: maintaining the equivalent of a fixed salary, having a stable workplace, fixed working hours, and forming a social welfare fund. However, there are fundamental differences in the way these conditions of stability are achieved in the Social and Solidarity Economy, which have to do with the organization of work within cooperatives. The main difference between work in solid modernity and work in the Social and Solidarity Economy is the existence of emancipated work. Emancipated work is a work of unique characteristics, it is not exploited work, since the ownership of the means of production of the cooperative is collective, it is not subordinated either because decisions are taken horizontally and mainly by consensus; it is not sanctioned, its fulfillment is given practically by the feeling of community of the cooperative; it is a work that allows creativity and human development. The literature supports the evidence that stability generates predictability and long-term planning due to the commitment of the members; this condition is present in cooperative management thanks to the existence of emancipated labor. In the long term, the space-time relationship of half of the cooperatives that operate with generational change in a family manner stands out. Future planning has been translated into concrete strategies for market growth, improvement of infrastructure, equipment, and use of the principle of open membership, by recovering the creativity of the members in the General Assembly. The research distinguishes two types of members, the leaders who act to guarantee collective stability through their shared commitment, direction, empathy, and recognition of the work done, which legitimizes them, and the followers who support the leaders’ efforts to maintain labor stability; both under a social relationship that is not based on surplus value. It is argued that the cooperatives have the capacity to make decisions shared because the consequences derive from the work of both. In the analyzed cooperatives there are no restrictions to the deployment of leadership, the results show a better positioning of the cooperatives that have more leaders because having more members involved in management enhances democratic participation and collectively acquired knowledge. This was exemplified by the activities of the management positions of the Board of Directors and Supervisory Board, which, following the law and commitment to the organization, contribute strategically to production, commercialization, and sound accounting, activities on which the conditions of stability depend (although there are also leading members without management positions). The limitation of the research has to do with the number of cooperatives interviewed and the characteristics of qualitative research, which prevents the results from being generalized to other cooperatives in Mexico City, other states, or the country. However, the results are theoretically framed in the structural tendencies experienced by the subjects of liquid modernity in neoliberalism, so they can be a reference. The originality and implications of the work lie in recognizing the ambivalence in the rationality of the subjects, when identifying the coexisting modernities to know what makes the stability of cooperatives possible in the urban environment, even when apparently only individualism and competition could prevail. On the other hand, emancipated work is a category little explored in the Social and Solidarity Economy, it emerged from both theoretical and applied analysis and made it possible to examine particularities that are deployed from the form of organization and management presented by cooperatives that adhere to a greater extent to the principles and cooperative organization. Emancipated work requires the collective control of the means of production typical of the Social and Solidarity Economy to advance towards an alternative economy and contributes to creative and democratic work that improves the living conditions of the partners and consequently their own life, and even those of the following generations for the creation of loyalty, feelings of community, identity, and enjoyment of the fruits of work. © 2021.

    abstract = {To improve the sustainability of food and agriculture, analyses are increasingly calling for forms of engagement by consumers that go beyond "voting with their dollars,” and for people to be food citizens. While the notion of food citizenship suggests innovative ways that consumers can contribute to sustainable transitions, there is a dearth of research on what it means for a person to act as a food citizen and the kinds of governance processes that enable food citizenship. Using a case study of a consumer cooperative, Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative, in Japan, this paper examines how consumers and producers act as food citizens, and the ways that governance processes affect food citizenship. Three sets of analyses are presented. First, the aspects of Seikatsu Club's governance system that promote and facilitate food citizenship are analyzed. Second, what it means to be food citizens and the kinds of activities consumers and producers partake in as food citizens are examined. Third, the ways that food citizenship impacts consumer-producer relations and sustainability are discussed. Specifically, the analysis of Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative indicates that food citizenship can facilitate mutual understanding and partnership between consumers and producers, and a sense of ownership by them over the food system and sustainability. In concluding, the implications of the findings on Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative for governance, food citizenship, and sustainability more generally are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {This article analyzes agricultural reform as an element of broader shifts in the Japanese welfare regime. In postwar Japan, agricultural support and protection served as a “functional equivalent” to welfare provision in rural and semi-rural areas. However, an ongoing agricultural reform process has put pressure on aging smallholders and on JA, the powerful organization of agricultural cooperatives. This article investigates how these local actors have responded to an increasingly hostile socio-economic and political environment. To address this question, the article focuses on hamlet-based collective farming, which is a form of agricultural production that can reproduce the welfare character of the postwar support and protection regime on the local level. Based on field research in several rural and semi-rural communities, the article argues that the functions and the local proliferation of hamlet-based farming are shaped by village institutions: hamlet-level norms and rules governing land use and agricultural cooperation, as well as social ties between hamlets, local co-ops, and local governments. While the integration of village institutions into local cooperative and administrative structures can support a systematic local proliferation of collective farming, municipal and cooperative mergers have rendered such comprehensive local responses more complicated. More generally, the article proposes to investigate local acts of recombining community ties and norms with changing macro policies as a promising analytical angle to understand the ongoing renegotiation of East Asian welfare regimes. © Pacific Affairs.},

Using a nationally representative survey dataset of smallholder maize producers from rural Nigeria, this study assesses the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on technical efficiency (TE). We based our estimation approach on the combination of a newly developed sample selection stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to control for possible selectivity biases from both observables and unobservables. We estimate stochastic meta-frontiers to examine TE differences between cooperative members and non-members. Our results reveal that TE levels of members are consistently higher than that of non-members. This calls for continued policy incentives targeted at encouraging farmers to form as well as participate in agricultural cooperatives. Copyright:  © 2021 Olagunju et al.

Findings: The findings show that before privatization took place, these industries were managed according to socialistic democratic principles. Once they became global and capitalistic, some kibbutz industries adopted a business cooperative style that combines features of capitalism and socialism, while others underwent a crisis and opted for a stricter and more bureaucratic managerial style. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on five case studies; further research is recommended to establish the current typology. Practical implications: This study shows very clearly that the cooperative business style can be offered for businesses previously operated according to socialistic principles. Originality/value: This study augments current literature by elucidating the speed with which business activity is conducted according to cooperative principles. It presents a typology relevant to kibbutz industry and cooperative organizations alike, addressing the cooperative managerial, cooperative business and bureaucratic styles, enabling maintenance of normative management that adapts itself to global and capitalistic environments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this research is to analyse the affective organizational commitment in cooperatives in Ecuador. This was done by adapting and testing a measurement scale based on the one-dimensional model proposed by Porter. Design/methodology/approach: Field work was carried out, with a structured questionnaire being given to a significant sample of workers in Ecuadorian cooperatives (2,499 employees and heads of department). The scale was adapted through a structural equation model. Findings: The results show that the adaptation of the measuring scale for affective organizational commitment using a one-dimensional vision is consistent for the cooperative sector. In addition, the analysis of the socio-demographic variables and the work position show that some of them have a statistically significant relationship with organizational commitment. Practical implications: The proposed scale can contribute to the management of human capital in cooperatives in Ecuador. It can also be used as a tool to support the national agency in charge of the cooperative sector in this country (Superintendencia de Economía Popular y Solidaria, “Superintendency of Popular and Solidarity Economy”). By applying this tool, social economy organizations in Ecuador can measure the level of their employees' affective commitment with the institution they work in. Using the results, the people in charge and the leaders of the organization shall be able to introduce strategies to develop this organizational variable that is crucial for the proper management of human resources and, therefore, to help to obtain the institutional purposes. Originality/value: This research project presents a measuring tool that can discover the unique features of the cooperative sector in a developing country such as Ecuador as it provides a special framework for managing human resources in this sector. Additionally, in a cooperative organization many employees have different roles in the same company. This tool can be adapted for other kinds of cooperatives with different activities (financial and non-financial activities) in different sectors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Organisations engage in coopetition, the simultaneous pursuit of competitive and cooperative activities, because of various environmental factors. The concept of coopetition continues to gain attention as global competition increases. However, the analysis of the influence of institutional elements on coopetition has been limited. This study bridges this gap. We use a case study to examine the coopetition framework among competing Japanese airlines formed to negotiate with major institutional elements: a monopolistic supplier and a government regulatory authority. First, this study identifies the mechanisms through which institutions promote coopetition. The findings point to coercive isomorphism and external hazard as influential institutional mechanisms; through coercive isomorphism, the shared benefits increase, and the cost of cooperation is reduced; through external hazard, organisations are encouraged to unite, and coopetition is promoted. Second, the study identifies the mechanisms through which organisations in coopetition enhance their bargaining power. Specifically, we find two sources of enhanced bargaining power: intensified pressure as a larger group and improved persuasiveness with consensus. These findings have important implications for the theory and management of co-operative organisations, such as for the interaction between co-operatives and institutions, since the coopetition framework we analysed has characteristics close to the values and principles of co-operatives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This moment is marked by the advancement of market globalisation, which has exerted great competitive pressure on national agribusiness.

This study aimed to identify and describe the main success or failure factors affecting agricultural cooperatives. To this end, bibliographic research was used as a research method, and 108 relevant works from the national and international literature were selected for analysis. The results pointed to the existence of 10 main success factors for agro-industrial cooperatives: conciliation of the dual agenda: social and economic goals; professionalisation of management; meeting the interests of multiple stakeholders; transaction cost management; risk and volatility manage-ment; improved commercialisation; competitiveness against traditional companies; technology adoption; sustainable development; and social responsibility. However, there is a gap regarding the existence of studies analysing, in an integrated manner, the prevalence and benefits of the success factors identified for agricultural cooperatives, especially those based in Brazil. © Author(s) 2021.},

    abstract = {Karnataka is one of the states, which experienced severe drought continuously for four years since 2014. In addition, heavy rainfall for the past two years has adversely affected agriculture produce in the entire state putting farmers into debt trap as most of them are not covered by crop insurance for crop failure. Although crop insurance was available to farmers in India since 1972, the coverage across the states including Karnataka was not found to be satisfactory. The average percentage of farmers covered under crop insurance was less than 10% during 1999-2015, both for India and Karnataka. It was 11.3% under NAIS 2015 kharif, increased to 12.2% in 2016, 17.1% in 2017 going down to 15.6% in 2018 and to 14.1% in 2019 under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) kharif in Karnataka. PMFBY was one new kind of agriculture insurance company and introduced throughout the country in 2016.This paper examines the performance of this scheme with specific reference to north Karnataka based on primary data collected from farmers’ survey in four districts, secondary data collected from official documents and first-hand information gathered from regional stakeholder workshops organized in six selected districts of north Karnataka. The study tries to look into the extent of coverage and, flaws and merits of crop insurance schemes with reference to problems faced by farmers in getting insurance coverage and claims. The study covered around 1000 stakeholders including farmers, officials of banks, department of economics and statistics, agriculture department and insurance agencies, representatives of gram panchayats and cooperative societies. Three agricultural crop seasons have passed since then. Central government has brought in some changes in guidelines and is likely to make further changes in procedures in response to concerns expressed by States and farmers’ representatives. Follow up discussions with key stakeholders in Karnataka held after the initial farmers’ survey reveal that while a few of the anomalies in applying for crop insurance have been addressed by the concerned departments, major obstacles in assessment and claims continue to exasperate farmers who are miffed by these procedural lapses. This paper throws light on some of these issues and discusses measures to make crop insurance, particularly PMFBY farmers’ friendly. © 2020, Nan Yang Academy of Sciences Pte. Ltd.

    abstract = {Digital platforms have disrupted traditional news organizations, with new platform-based models gaining ground. However, the incumbents can defend their positions and reap the benefits of multi-sided market structures by establishing a platform business model themselves. We examine a case study of the Austrian News Agency (APA), which gradually formulated a strategy that resulted in a platform-based business model. Platform features were strategized and innovated over time and in phases, with the intent of creating value for customers on both sides of the platform. We found that APA’s platform transformation was enabled by a visionary value proposition backed by a trusted institution’s legitimacy and a co-operative organizational model that provided added incentives for the participating news media companies. The strategy and the business model emerged on the basis of external developments and internal realizations concerning the feasibility of the new platform strategy. Based on our results, we develop a framework for an incumbent strategy formation process towards a platform business model. This framework demonstrates the incumbent organization’s emergent, as well as deliberate, strategic ability to introduce platform features into its business model, based on unique intra-firm synergies with established parts of the business, and highlighting a potential for “incumbent advantage.”. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {Among other things, fertility control in Nigeria may not be feasible without recourse to socioeconomic issues such as micro-occupation classification and dominant family cultural traditions facing women and their relationship to fertility behaviour. Rural small-scale women farmers are a relatively closed group with some uniqueness for the understanding of the value of children (VOC) in socioeconomic and cultural contexts and its relationship with fertility behaviour in developing nations. This study, guided by the VOC model, focuses on determining factors for preference for family size (0-4 children) among rural small-scale women farmers in Eha-Amufun in Enugu state. 200 married women (mean age = 33.9; mean age at marriage = 24.5) from 20 agricultural co-operative societies were selected for the study. The study adopted a survey and quantitative research design. Besides the sociodemographic information of the study participants, the study elicited from the respondents information on their choice of family size, the connection of family size with their occupation and the circumstances surrounding son preference and son adoption in the family and rural contexts. The collected data were analysed using the ordinal logistic regression model. The findings show that economic independence, son preference and male child adoption negates limiting family sizes to 0-4 (p<.05) however, age, formal education, children as source of labour and economic independence were positively correlated with the desire for a family size of 4 children and above. In view of the limitations of the study and the ability of the VOC model to unveil spurious factors for fertility behaviour among women, there is a need for comparative studies of rural closed groups in developing nations and their fertility behaviour. © 2021, Bundesinstitut fur Bevolkerungsforschung.

    abstract = {This study used the United Kingdom and feed barley as case example to highlight the potential of climate mitigation policies in the global north to create food vulnerabilities in the global south or widen the food gap between the global north and south. Future UK feed barley supply was assessed under the influence of projected climate change, climate mitigation policy scenarios, and population growth. The results showed that land-based climate mitigation policies reduced land area for barley and created large deficits in supply. Using Algeria and Tunisia as exemplar global south countries that rely on barley supply from the United Kingdom and Europe for food and feed, the article concludes that pursuit of land-based mitigation policies, in the global north, which reduce the production of globally important food security crops, can create or amplify food vulnerabilities in the global south. Tunisia's imports, for example, are about 290% of domestic production. These countries need feed barley to maintain high domestic animal production for food and religious needs, which limit meat imports. The asymmetries in technical, economic, and political power between the global north and south imply that the latter could be outcompeted. In serving the climate justice principle of "equitable sharing of burdens and benefits,"the article argues that climate mitigation policies should address (not amplify) the uneven geographical and social impacts of climate change. This principle should be integral to the appraisal of public policies and actions on land-based climate mitigation policies and prioritized in climate justice discourse in a genuine global cooperative framework. This is as urgent as the need for climate mitigation action. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of organizational structure and variations in legal systems on the MFI dual performance goals. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample that includes 1,518 MFIs from 105 different countries over a period of 20 years, this study analyzes the data by applying a model that includes six categories of organizational structures and variations of legal systems, including both civil and common law, with accounting performance measures for the dependent variables. Findings: The analyses provide robust results indicating that MFIs structured as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have better social outreach than all other types of MFIs and exhibit better financial performance than MFIs registered as commercial banks or credit unions. Legal systems also played a role in MFI effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: Given the increasing importance of MFIs on economic development globally, this study has relevance on how the impact of MFI structural characteristics and macro-level influences on their dual performance criteria can be translated into management approaches and governance policies that can increase the effectiveness of these dual (i.e. social and financial) goals. Originality/value: This study is more comprehensive than prior research in addressing the influence of organizational structures of MFIs and legal systems on MFI dual mission, namely, its financial performance and social outreach, thereby increasing our understanding of policy implications in sustaining the MFI’s developmental role. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Hom Mali rice contains various unique characteristics with one being its aroma. A reduction in the aroma or 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) of Hom Mali rice during post-harvesting activities has become a major problem for stakeholders and exporters in the rice supply chain. This paper investigated logistics and processing cost analysis of the rice mills of two agricultural cooperatives, AC1 and AC2, by using the activity-based costing (ABC) method. Moreover, the relationship between the loss of aroma and the cost processing activity has been explored using partial correlation. Findings showed that the total cost of AC1 was 4.986 baht/kg, which was separated into the logistics cost of 58.18 percent and the processing cost of 41.82 percent. The total cost of AC2 was 5.851 baht/kg, consisting of the logistics cost of 77.34 percent and the processing cost of 22.66 percent. For the processing activities, the significant relationship between the activity costs and the loss of aroma, while controlling the levels of 2AP, suggested that aroma retaining must regard decisions on the selections of processing activities including polishing, whitening, bagging, and dehulling activities. In the logistics aspect, the cooperatives should focus on raw material receiving, warehousing, packing, and transportation activities. Decisions on the improvement of logistics and processing activities involved with aroma loss of Hom Mali rice should rely on cost analysis, maintaining the quality of rice, and meeting both domestic and international demand. © 2021 Kasetsart University.},

The social capital concept is integrated with cooperative lifecycle theory to describe the change of cooperative social capital along the lifecycle. We propose that cooperatives in different stages of the lifecycle are featured with different levels of social capital. Cooperatives usually enjoy a high level of social capital in the early stages of the lifecycle. However, the level of social capital in cooperatives exhibits a declining trend along the development of the organization. The decrease of social capital will lead to an imbalance of the social and economic attributes of cooperatives. The cooperative’s governance structure must change accordingly. We argue that it is important for cooperatives to maintain and develop the social capital strategically over time. Otherwise, the comparative advantage of the cooperative business form may disappear. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

    abstract = {The Cooperative Law, passed in 2007, aims to support and regulate farmer cooperatives in China. The adoption of its regulations is uneven, with most regulations followed except the one-person, one-vote rule. We model investment decisions of Chinese cooperatives and measure the efficiency of capital allocation under heterogeneous membership and alternative governance policies. We show that relative membership heterogeneity in equity and patronage holdings and a cooperative’s dividend policy are crucial in determining the optimal level of governance centralization. Centralizing the governance to major equity holders and following other regulations reflect a trade-off faced by cooperatives between obtaining financial support from the government and achieving efficient decision-making. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

    abstract = {Rural women substantially contribute to agricultural production and development in South Asia, and farmer cooperatives have been promoted to empower them. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effects of cooperative membership on women. In this paper, we evaluate impacts of membership in women-only and mixed-gender cooperatives in South India on women’s intra-household decision-making power, using data of 313 female milk producers. Propensity score matching and a two-step control function approach are employed to account for selection bias due to observed and unobserved factors. We find that membership in either women-only or mixed-gender cooperatives has a positive impact on intra-household decision-making power. In particular, members of mixed-gender cooperatives gain significantly more power over decisions regarding dairy production, compared to members of women-only cooperatives. We conclude that women-only cooperatives are not more effective for women’s empowerment than mixed-gender cooperatives. However, because women have limited access to mixed-gender cooperatives, women-only cooperatives are generally more accessible for the majority of them. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Through the use of institutional and agency theory, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the cooperative form of organization and investor-owned firms-investigating how the social–political structures in a community affect the efficiency of cooperatives vis-à-vis investor-owned firms. This paper also attempts to offer a better understanding of how government quality and organizational size influence performance outcomes between different organizational forms specifically in the Philippines. Design Methodology Approach: The empirical analysis of this study was conducted among electric distribution utilities in the Philippines. Firm-level data was generated for 133 distributors, consisting of 119 electric cooperatives and 14 investor-owned companies. Panel data regressions were ran to test all hypotheses. Findings: Cooperative organizations operate at a less efficient rate than investor-owned firms in the Philippines, even when controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, customer density and profitability. In addition, the efficiency of these cooperative organizations is more strongly influenced by the quality of the local government than investor-owned firms. Originality Value: Positive externalities generated by the propagation of cooperatives on local communities may be based primarily on our understanding of how cooperatives have functioned largely in western contexts. Within the context of Southeast Asia, where national socio-political structures may be more dysfunctional, this paper observes that there is an equivalent negative externality caused by the tendency of cooperatives to replicate the political mismanagement of the community around it. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Fairtrade labeling has the potential to increase market efficiency by connecting farmers to altruistic consumers who are willing to pay a premium for sustainability-certified products. A requirement for increased efficiency, though, is that the farmers' benefits are larger than the Fairtrade processing costs and the excess payment by consumers that does not accrue to farmers; otherwise direct transfers to farmers would be more efficient. This paper analyzes how excess payment for Fairtrade-labeled coffee is distributed in the Swedish market, using information on production costs and scanner data on almost all roasted and ground coffee products sold by retailers. A key finding is that roasters and retailers get 61-70%, while producer countries, in this paper comprising coffee farmers, cooperatives, middlemen, exporters, and Fairtrade International, get 24-31%; Fairtrade Sweden gets 6-8%. These values are the upper and lower bounds that reflect assumptions made about the additional costs of producing roasted and ground Fairtrade coffee, given the cost of beans and the Fairtrade license. The Fairtrade label thus seems to create a coffee product that roasters and retailers can use to exploit their market power. © 2020 by the author.},

To build customer trust and provide members incentives, the organization structures itself as a producer cooperative and sets up a parallel sector that yields cash revenues and provides short-term benefits. This parallel activity, if successful, may represent a temptation away from revolution, but it is subject to competition from other providers or from the state. The main result is that, unlike a profit-maximizing firm, the cooperative reacts to increased competition by shrinking the parallel sector and specializing in revolution; hence, reform expands at the expense of revolution only if the parallel sector approaches monopoly. We find supportive historical evidence in a survey of socialist revolutions and social democracies, nationalist movements, and Islamist insurgencies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The implication here is that nearly three out of every four SACCOs have adopted at least one form of e-commerce to support their business operations. The key factors identified in the study to influence e-commerce adoption in the participating SACCOs were technology cost (88%), available budget (41%), and senior management support that were captured from about 25% of the respondents. From the study, two critical barriers to effective utilisation of e-commerce for SACCOs in their business operations are the conservative organisation cultures that can be summed up as resistant to change and lack of peerage on the industry standards.

Agricultural cooperatives have played an important role in promoting the modernization and intensification of Chinese agricultural sector. Given the increasing concerns about environmental harm, however, it still remains unclear whether and the extent to which agricultural cooperatives contributes to reducing environmental impacts of agricultural production. Hence, this study performed an environmental evaluation using life cycle assessment for three different organization forms of grape production in Changli County, Hebei Province, China: smallholder farmers, farmer-owned cooperatives and investor-owned firm-led cooperatives. Then the results of life cycle assessment were monetarized and cost benefit analysis was used to evaluate the economic performance of these three organization forms of grape production. The results demonstrate that investor-owned firm-led cooperatives present an overall improvement in environmental and economic performance with the lowest weighted environmental index (integrating all impact categories into a single score), the highest net profit and the highest total net benefit. The results also show a difference in potential improvement in environmental impacts and economic returns between cooperatives and smallholder farmers. Additionally, the production and application of organic and chemical fertilizer and pesticide have been identified as major contributors to total environmental damage. © 2021 Deng et al.

Academic/practical relevance: In a cooperative (co-op), operational and financial decisions are inseparable because the co-op's investment capital is linked to its economic transactions with members. We include unique features of co-ops into an analytical model and derive some key results that are different from those for investor-owned corporations. Methodology: In the presence of yield and market uncertainty, we model this situation using a Markov decision process wherein the decisions of processing quantity interact with the financial decisions of retained earnings and short-term loans. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the aggregated farmers' payments over a finite horizon. Results: (1) Characterization of the properties of the value function and the optimal policy; (2) explicit expressions for the deterministic yield dynamic program, wherein a myopic policy is optimal; and (3) identification of financial risks associated with uncertain market and yield. Managerial implications: The results provide insight into a coop's decision making, cash position, and risk management. © 2019 INFORMS},

This article argues that co-operatives have been undervalued and overlooked as a platform for Indigenous notions of socio-economic development and micro-nationalist movements.

We used the partial least squares structural equation modelling method and the appropriate software to test the theoretical research model and the proposed hypotheses to examine the relationships among the individual selected constructs in more depth. The findings point to the existence of a statistically significant relationship between EO and IP, which, however, is weaker than the overall effect of the involvement of mediation variables. Each mediation variable (IWB and KBDC) increases the overall effect separately, but their joint mediation action is of the greatest importance, when full mediation takes place. The strength of the relationship between the two main variables is also influenced by the size of the agrarian enterprise such that being larger has a negative moderation effect.

Using the strong duality theory of stochastic linear programs, we not only prove that the core of agricultural producers’ cooperative game is nonempty but also provide a simple way to compute a profit allocation policy in the core. We establish the convexity of agricultural producers’ cooperative game so that the game has population monotonicity, which gives agricultural producers an incentive to expand their current coalition. We then analyze the agricultural producers’ cooperative game with a concave cost structure, which may exhibit economies of scale for production. Taking advantage of the proposed stochastic duality approach, the agricultural producers’ cooperative game with a concave cost structure is also shown to have a nonempty core. © 2020 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

The study found that age, marital status, level of education, household size, number of children, renting a house, life style of the future retiree, income, risk level of job and types of retirement plan are the driving forces behind the retirement plans of self-employed workers. Practical implications: Using the identified types of financial plan and driving forces in this study, governments in the developing countries can develop and implement self-employed pension schemes, educate and encourage more self-employed workers to plan for their retirement. Originality/value: Analysing the driving forces behind retirement plans of self-employed people in developing economies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Formal tree producer associations are critical for the sustainable management of private commercial farm forests in Kenya. However, there is limited information on their current status and the key factors driving their operations in the country. This paper sought to address this informational gap by reviewing the existing literature in the country from the theoretical background of sustainable development and later validating the obtained findings with the current state of knowledge at regional and global levels. Results from document content analysis indicate that there are over 10,000 tree growing farmers organized into planting groups across the country after many years of piloting by the government and private sector players. At the national level, there are two associations. These include Kenya Forest Growers Association (KEFGA), mainly composed of large scale planters, and Farm Forestry Smallholder Producers Association of Kenya (FFSPAK), targeting small-holders. Besides these two, six major sub-national associations are seeking to improve members' welfare by enhancing the acquisition of livelihood assets. Further, various socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect their operations in Kenya. These associations have deployed multiple strategies to benefit their members. However, the formation of savings and credit cooperative societies (SACCOs) seems to be their preferred mode of community empowerment. In conclusion, even though these associations are still at the infancy stage, their future remains promising in-view of the observed behavioral change in their governance, which appears to favor entrenched equality and equity towards sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Common property institutions in natural resource management are often analysed by means of Ostrom’s framework of design principles. Recently, the design principles have been generalised to study human groups in other collective action scenarios, including farm producers who collectively buy inputs or sell outputs. Several case studies have conceptualised farmer cooperatives as common property institutions to study how various collective action scenarios have been approached. We contribute to the scarce literature with a field study in the Upper West Region of Ghana, using Ostrom’s framework to compare the design principles of active and inactive farmer cooperatives. Using the mean group comparison method, we find numerous significant differences as active farmer cooperatives have clearer boundaries, require more capital investments, have more active board directors and managers, receive more governmental support, and have more locations. However, not all design principles are significantly different for active and inactive cooperatives (e.g. sanctions, legal rights). Considering our results, we perceive opportunities to formalise the conceptualisation of farmer cooperatives as common property institutions with both internal and external design principles. Our results also have policy implications in terms of top-down initiatives to spur collective action by Ghanaian farm producers. © 2021 The Author(s).},

However, the results are mixed and limited research in the co-operatives context has creates a great interest to fill the conspicuous gap. This study seeks to examine the potential relationship between board characteristics and co-operative reputation in Malaysia from the perspective of resource-based view theory (RBVT). Hence, multiple regressions were conducted to analyze the relationship between co-operatives reputation with the respect of Top 100 Co-operatives Index and board characteristics in terms of board size, ethnic diversity, gender diversity, age diversity and education diversity in this study. The sample is composed of 61 listed co-operatives in the Top 100 Co-operatives Index for the three-consecutive year during the period 2015 to 2017. Reputation data were obtained from Top 100 Co-operative Index that published at Malaysia Co-operative Societies Commission (MCSC) website. While, the data of board characteristics and co-operative size on log of total assets which lagged by a year were extracted from MCSC's INFOKOP system that provides both financial and non-financial data. The results found that Malaysian co-operatives that appear high up in terms of ranking in the reputation MCSC index tend to have a greater proportion of high educational directors on their board. Other board characteristics including board size, ethnic diversity, gender diversity and age diversity were not associated with the reputation of co-operatives. This generally can be explained that different types of law, geography, historical background, cultural environment and other factors may affect composition and diversity; and particularly the board in co-operative societies. Findings of this study provide insights into potential strategies in relation to corporate governance towards improving co-operative's values and indirectly help the government in achieving the national economic goals. © 2020, Sciedu Press.},

    abstract = {This study comprises a qualitative analysis of the governance structures within the two largest agricultural cooperatives in Sweden, both of which have large and heterogeneous memberships, as well as sizeable and complex business operations. Interviews were conducted with district council members and representatives from the boards of directors. The data from both case cooperatives indicate a genuinely traditional democratic member governance structure. There is a great deal of social capital in the governance system. A tentative explanation of the member involvement is that the cooperatives’ equity capital is owned by the individual members, and the members are free to sell and buy their shares at a market rate. The members are satisfied with the return on the capital they have invested in the cooperatives. They receive bonus shares and dividends above what most members would get in other investments. A conclusion is that very large cooperatives may succeed well with a member-democratic governance system of the traditional cooperative type, which in this case is probably due to the members’ satisfaction with the individualized ownership of the cooperatives. © 2020 by the authors.

    abstract = {Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify factors of leadership and organizational support that have effect on establishing the characteristics of agile organizational culture adopted recently by many organizations as a way to deal with rapidly changing market. Methods/Statistical analysis: A research model was developed, based on previous studies, by selecting Empowerment, Use of Collective Intelligence, and Continuous Learning, selected as Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture, and Servant Leadership and Perceived Organizational Support (POS) as the influencing variables. The relationships among variables were identified using regression analysis and mediating effect analysis. The subjects were workers working at headquarters of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and the Agribusiness Group. The questionnaire survey was conducted for about one month from Jan., 2020 and a total of 157 valid samples were obtained. SPSS (Ver. 22.0) was used in statistical analysis. Findings: The results showed that the Servant Leadership has statistically significant effect on Empowerment and Use of Collective Intelligence but not on Continuous Learning which are Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture. The Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has statistically significant effect on all of the Characteristics of Agile Organizational Culture: Empowerment, Use of Collective Intelligence, and Continuous Learning. The results of mediating effect analysis showed that POS partially mediated the effect of Servant Leadership on Empowerment and Use of Collective Intelligence and fully mediated the effect on Continuous Learning. The results suggested that, for the establishment of agile culture in an organization, it is very important to exercise Servant Leadership, which is a leadership that maximize the potential of the members of the organization based on the spirit of human respect, and to give to members the perception of the full support and rewards provided by organization. Improvements/Applications: This study was conducted for employees working at a specific organization therefore it is difficult to generalize the results to overall industries and organizations. In the future, it is necessary to expand sample population and to conduct comparative studies between groups that have introduced agile organizational culture and ones that does not. It is also recommended to conduct additional studies on the factors of leadership and organizational support that have effect on the characteristics of agile organizational culture. © 2020, Sciedu Press.},

    abstract = {Climate change constitutes a major threat to agricultural production, food security, and natural resource management. Saudi Arabia is particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events, such as arid weather and drought. The purpose of this study is to assess farmers’ beliefs and concerns as regards climate change. Extensive interviews were conducted with 164 farmers in the Jazan region. Results revealed that 89.6% of the farmers believed that climate change is due to human activities and 93.3% believed that it is because of natural change. Seventy-five percent of the farmers were concerned about insects and 73% about the prevalence of weeds on their farms. Findings of cluster analysis revealed that farmers who are more likely to believe in climate change are more in agreement with the role of extension services in capacity building. Farmers’ beliefs about climate change were significantly influenced by membership of agricultural cooperatives, access to loans, use of extension services, age, farm size, and level of soil fertility. Access to loans was the only significant factor to explain the differences in farmers’ concerns. These results suggest the need for capacity‐building activities targeted at improving farmers’ adaptability to manage climate variability. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

    abstract = {Post-1994, the South African government has favoured cooperatives over other types of corporate entities in its rural development programmes. An improved understanding of the key drivers underpinning the performance of cooperatives is important for informing government programmes and policies that target cooperatives. This study examined the financial efficiency, and its determinants, of 387 agricultural cooperatives in South Africa, using the Simar–Wilson methodology. Bias-corrected Data Envelopment Analysis estimates for financial efficiency were obtained in the first stage. The results indicated that many agricultural cooperatives are relatively inefficient, compared to the three best-performing cooperatives on the efficient boundary. In the second stage, a double bootstrap truncated regression model was used to obtain bias-corrected scores that excluded the best-performing cooperatives. The statistically significant efficiency determinants identified from the analysis were the age and size of the cooperative, the gender of the principal manager of the cooperative, its governance and the training indicators. The observed relationship between governance and efficiency may be attributed to institutions that prioritise non-financial goals by being relatively more willing to compromise on governance quality. Furthermore, deviations from sound institutional control mechanisms are more likely to emerge in cooperatives that have weak institutional and organisational arrangements. © 2020 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

Why do they continue to emerge? What are their possibilities? What happens when they are developed? Objective: to comprehend, in theoretical terms and on the basis of existing research, the cooperation phenomenon, especially that which inspires cooperative organizations. Methodology: the research employed a systemic and complex conception of the cooperation phenomenon and of its object of study, developing a qualitative, interpretative, and reflexive discussion according to three themes: being, doing, and becoming. Results: Cooperatives, as human organizations, go through an evolutionary process, suffering the inherent problems of administration and maintenance of democracy. To face the degenerative process, it is necessary to rethink cooperative management based on systemic theories and self-reinforcing cooperative identity. Conclusion: cooperation is fundamental for life in society, which explains the fact that cooperatives continue to emerge even in the midst of a hostile environment. Contrary to what has been disseminated, we are not only competitive, we are also cooperative and our knowledge needs to be urgently reconstructed. © 2020, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

A secondary objective is to introduce to the non-Chinese speaking world a literature written by Chinese scholars as they view the emergence of this new organizational form in the agricultural sector. Our interest is to illustrate Chinese cooperative literature within two general approaches: articles which address agricultural cooperatives’ inter-firm coordination issues and articles which study the mechanism design which we call intra-firm coordination. A total of 443 articles were reviewed, 163 dealing with inter-firm coordination and 280 with intra-firm coordination. The inter-firm coordination articles focused on firm coordination mechanisms and formal institutions such as cooperative law, accounting rules, financial markets, and government support. Intra-firm coordination articles focused on organization design, cooperative governance, relationships between members and cooperative, property rights, and hierarchical structures with embedded principal–agent issues. We conclude with observations about trends, quality, and the cooperative future and also propose useful research fields for Chinese scholars. © 2020 Edgard Milhaud Foundation},

    abstract = {Infection of wheat by Fusarium species can lead to Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) and mycotoxin contamination, thereby reducing food quality and food safety, and leading to economic losses. Agronomic management through the implementation of various pre-harvest measures can reduce the probability of Fusarium spp. infection in the wheat field. To design interventions that could stimulate wheat farmers to (further) improve their agronomic management to reduce FHB, it is key to understand farmers’ behaviour towards adapting their management. The aim of this paper was to understand the intention, underlying behavioural constructs, and beliefs of Dutch wheat farmers to adapt their agronomic management to reduce FHB and mycotoxin contamination in wheat, applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Data were collected from 100 Dutch wheat farmers via a questionnaire. The standard TPB analysis was extended with an assessment of the robustness of the belief results to account for the statistical validity of the analysis on TPB beliefs (i.e. to address the so-called expectancy-value muddle). Forty-six percent of the farmers had a positive intention to change their management in the next 5 years. The two behavioural constructs significantly related to this intention were attitude and social norm, whereas association with the perceived behavioural control construct was insignificant indicating that farmers did not perceive any barriers to change their behaviour. Relevant attitudinal beliefs indicated specific attributes of wheat, namely yield, quality and safety (lower mycotoxin contamination). This indicates that strengthening these beliefs—by demonstrating that a change in management will result in a higher yield and quality and lower mycotoxin levels—will result in a stronger attitude and, subsequently, a higher intention to change management. Interventions to strengthen these beliefs should preferably go by the most important referents for social norms, which were the buyers and the farmer cooperatives in this study.

    abstract = {Producer organizations (POs) provide benefits to smallholders by alleviating market access challenges. However, whether all farmers benefit from a PO is still a question. Limited evidence is available on whether POs are inclusive of poor farmers. Even if the poor join, do they participate in decision-making? We conducted interviews with 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya. We distinguish three groups; members of a bargaining PO, members of a processing PO and non-members. We show that membership is related to the structural characteristics of the organization: processing POs favor membership of farmers that are wealthier, more educated and more innovative. As to participation in the decision-making process: older, male and specialized farmers have a higher chance of being involved than poor farmers. Factors distinguishing farmer participation in decision-making between bargaining and processing POs are highlighted. We find that a bargaining PO is more inclusive of all groups of farmers, while women and poor farmers are excluded from decision-making in a processing PO. Our findings contribute to policymaking on inclusive development. © 2020 The Authors.

    abstract = {Using local provincial authorities, the government of Zambia has demonstrated renewed interest in cooperatives as a means of reaching smallholder farmers in rural areas. There exists, however, the problem of high heterogeneity within cooperatives regarding members’ commitment, with many passive members holding only formal membership and having a minimal understanding of the cooperative's principles and benefits. The main objective of this study was to analyse how varying levels of members’ commitment determine their economic benefits. We selected a total of 215 rice farmers (72 active and 143 passive members) from two rice-dominant districts and used the propensity score matching technique and endogenous treatment regression model for the analysis. The study results show that educational level, distance to the cooperative, members’ perception about trust and acceptance, and value of the investment in the cooperative have a considerable influence on member commitment. The results further indicate that actively committed members of the cooperative achieve much more economic benefits than passive members. © 2021 The Author(s).

    abstract = {ABSTRACT: The incidence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) contamination in raw milk and its association with herd types was investigated in the ten provinces of Southern China in 2018. A total of 797 raw milk samples were collected from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Anhui provinces. The herd types were classified according to their characteristics. Among the 797 samples, 401 were owned by large-scale farms (herd size >500 cows, for dairy cow farming), 303 were owned by milk processing plants (herd size >500 cows, for dairy cow farming + milk processing), and 93 were owned by small farm cooperatives (herd size ≤500 cows, for dairy cow farming). The results revealed the presence of AFM1 in 94 of the 797 samples (11.80%). None of them was above 500 ng/L (Chinese and US limit standard), whereas 0.88% were above 50 ng/L (EU limit standard). The AFM1 concentrations in samples non-compliant with the EU standard were 52, 61, 88, 89.5, 164, 240, and 486 ng/L, respectively. It is important to note that samples exceeding the EU limit were mainly found in the area of Jiangsu and Guangxi provinces, and the herd type of milk processing plants. Hence, it is necessary to monitor and enforce the regulatory compliance of AFM1 levels in the raw milk from these specific areas and herd type.Highlights A total of 797 raw milk samples from three herd types, were collected from ten provinces of Southern China in 2018. Ninety-four of the 797 raw milk samples (11.80%) were positive for AFM1, and none of them was above the Chinese and US legal limit, only 0.88% of samples were above the EU limit. All of the exceed samples defined by EU limit were found in the area of Jiangsu and Guangxi provinces and belonged to milk processing plants. © 2021 The Author(s).

    abstract = {Why are vigilant organizations better at developing foresight than their rivals and acting faster on the insights and alerts? Four attributes were hypothesized to explain the difference between vigilant and vulnerable organizations: (a) a leadership commitment to sensing and acting early on signals of change, (b) strategic investments in foresight abilities, (c) a flexible approach to incorporating uncertainty in their strategy processes, and (d) clear accountability and coordination for sharing information and acting on weak signals. This conceptual model was tested with survey responses from 345 organizational leaders representing three sectors of the economy: international companies, US credit unions, and American foundations. The survey assessed key components of the above constructs and our regression models explained close to half of the variance in organizational vigilance scores relative to competitors. The most important of the four factors above was investment in foresight (for each sector), followed by leadership commitment. The relative importance of strategy and accountability factors varied by sector as well as organizational size. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

    abstract = {Although many studies analyzed effects of sustainability standards—such as Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance—on smallholder farmers in developing countries, most did not sufficiently account for systematic differences between certified and noncertified farmers. Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector. © 2020 The Authors.

    abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze how multirational management relates to cooperatives’ corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: A typology of agricultural cooperatives’ potential for multirational management in relation to corporate governance is proposed. Coordinates based on data from assembly participation and separation of ownership and control are used to map cooperatives among these typologies. Four case studies representing each typology were conducted, allowing analysis of propositions. Findings: By mapping the cooperatives from Mato Grosso do Sul, a reduced potential for multirational management is noted. By analyzing the four case studies, coded as Coop 1, 3, 13 and 16, this study found convergence with P1, P2 and P3. “Coop 1” shows signs of adopting exploitation practice. In “Coop 3,” evidence points to avoidance practice and, analyses of “Coop 13” indicates adoption of tolerance practice. In Coop 16, however, P4 could not be confirmed. Instead of polarizing practices, there is evidence of avoidance practice. Therefore, a positive relation between corporate governance and multirational management can partially be observed. Originality/value: There are no records of a paper that has explored the relation of governance and multirational management. Therefore, this research broadens the understanding of how corporate governance can function in the context of cooperative organizations. As well, insight is given on how different mechanisms of corporate governance can influence organizations to adopt explicit or implicit and monorational or multirational methods of dealing with multiple rationalities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The qualitative research was carried out in 4 agricultural cooperatives, two considered an emerging model and two traditional cooperatives. The investigation was conducted through the analysis of minutes of Ordinary General Meetings, statutes, and semi-structured interviews with managers and presidents. It was observed that the agricultural cooperatives, seen as an emerging model, where there is a selection of new members and act in a purchasing pool format, demonstrate an evolution concerning the traditional model by pointing to a greater professionalization of management, evidence of the separation between property and management. Moreover, the emerging model becomes more attractive than the traditional one by efficiently allocating the residual rights (earnings). © 2021. All Rights Reserved},

One of the biggest problems arising from joining financial goals with social goals is the presence of increasing tensions between the members and stakeholders involved. Nevertheless, there has not been enough focus on how managers, employees, and stakeholders respond to the tensions caused by contradictions and how they try to reach a balance between financial, environmental, and social goals. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating how members of an agricultural cooperative in the Apulia region (Italy) try to join the organizational forms of business and social values, namely, the sustainable practices related to CO2 emission reduction, resource use efficiency, and food waste mitigation. Additionally, the study goes further and explores whether and how these contradictory pressures are solved. Starting from the sensemaking approach, the study carried out an inductive case study through the use of a multiple case study design and in-depth interviews. The findings highlight the following two novel aspects: (1) Managers prefer to adopt a cumulative mitigating hybridization approach and (2) a weak integration can be noticed between social and commercial dimensions, originating from a lack of holistic perspective and poor interorganizational communication. © 2020 by the authors.},

Following El Salvador’s “turn to the left”, Salvadoran agrarian reform cooperatives and civil society allies began to allocate organizational resources toward writing public policy measures to incorporate agroecology under the FMLN government’s agricultural social program, the Family Agriculture Plan (PAF). While the cooperative sector took part in active negotiations with the FMLN party for the institutionalization of favorable policies, the former guerrilla party formulized strategies for gaining a multiclass electorate in order to remain in power. With the intention to better understand the attitude and distinct Salvadoran actors, we utilize an anthropology of public policy framework to indicate how expectations of political party legitimacy failed to shape the institutionalization of agroecology in El Salvador. We suggest that the pursuit of agroecological policies is a balancing act of making use of the State to strengthen on the ground efforts without forging organizational disarticulation following changes in government administrations. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

    abstract = {A global shortfall in protein supply from capture fisheries has motivated the Malaysian government to revise its aquaculture strategy, focusing on three commodities: seaweed, fish and marine shrimp. However, the performance of the Malaysian aquaculture sector, particularly seaweed production, is poorly documented. This is the first empirical study to undertake a value chain analysis (VCA) of the Malaysian seaweed sector using stakeholder perceptions and secondary data that encompass members of seaweed farming cooperatives (the Semporna Area Farmers’ Association and the governments’ flagship Seaweed Cluster Project). Fieldwork was conducted between April and June 2015 among seaweed stakeholders involved in the value chain using a mixed methods approach—in-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions, household surveys, personal observation and secondary data. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from both upstream (seaweed farming, marketing structure and the Malaysian Good Aquaculture Practices [MyGAP] certification programme) and downstream (seaweed processing) activities involving farmers, intermediaries/middlemen (buyers), processors and officials. Kappaphycus spp. was sold in two forms: (1) dried seaweed to be used as raw materials in carrageenan processing (approximately 90% of total harvest) and (2) fresh seaweed to be used as a source of seedlings (approximately 10% of total harvest). The value chain ended with the carrageenan form, which is exported to international markets. The price of dried seaweed varied according to a combination of seaweed quality, the strength of farmer’s relationships with intermediaries and processors and in response to demand from the carrageenan industry. The prices obtained by Malaysian farmers for dried seaweed and carrageenan remained low, US$ 0.60 and US$ 4.43 per kg, respectively, despite efforts by the government to enhance the value chain by imposing seaweed standards (via MyGAP) for farm management, dried seaweed and semi-refined carrageenan. The VCA was a useful tool to identify and map the market, with the results providing a better understanding of the seaweed sector, which could be helpful in supporting further aquaculture development in Malaysia. © 2019, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {The goal of this paper is to test the hypothesis of positive correlation between the innovative work behavior (IWB) support on the part of agricultural managers and the production performance of agricultural companies, mediated through information sharing in the companies. The research was performed on a sample of 175 companies of primary agricultural production in Slovakia. All data was analysed using the SPSS version 22.0 software package. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to assess the internal consistency of scales reliability. The Baron and Kenny mediator model was also used. The hypothesis was confirmed by the research. Complete mediation was identified where up to 91.6% of the overall effect is mediated through the sharing of the information variable. The practical implications of the research point out that the transparency of communication and support of innovations introduce positive effects in relation to the performance of agricultural companies. The IWB support is a predictor of production performance of agricultural companies. However, it does not have a clear effect; the effects of other factors are important. The IWB support positively affects the production performance of companies through the sharing of information between the managers and the employees, which becomes an important tool of innovative management. Agricultural cooperatives and joint stock companies can profit less significantly from the IWB support through the sharing of information than limited liability companies. The effect of IWB support on the production performance of cooperatives in natural expression shows statistically less significant impact. © 2021, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Results: The results indicated that there is an effective contribution of internal communication to organizational objectives, and that the process of communication and leadership play a key role in these objectives. However, it was found that information technology systems, acquired to facilitate the organization's communication process, have a negative influence on internal communication and its objectives. Theoretical/Methodological contributions: This work contributes to the Marketing literature, addressing elements of the Internal Marketing process little studied so far. Managerial contributions: For managerial purposes, the results allow generations-adjusted internal communication decisions, especially gen Y. © 2021 Revista Brasileira de Marketing.

    abstract = {Agricultural cooperatives (ACs) are major players in European farming, where they account for 40–60% of agricultural trade, and are key actors in articulating rural realities. This paper offers a solidary critique of ACs beyond the dominant institutional economics lens, and aims to resume the debate on their de/repoliticisation. Evidence presented points towards a continuous process of co-optation of ACs by the dominant food regime as well as decreased adherence to cooperative principles, revealing theoretical parallelisms with the organic and fair trade movements. While acknowledging the important role ACs play in supporting farmers, many of who interviewed for this research reported they could not survive without them, this paper warns of the loss of their historical political roots, and introduces a new theoretical framework for a more integrated study of ACs in the context of wider food system forces. The framework is composed of three conceptual components: first, the coooperative triangle illustrates interwoven cooperative identitary dimensions; second, the cooperative hourglass depicts ongoing tensions between the cooperative economic and governance model, and the market economy they exist in; and third, the concept of cooperative sustainability brings together the previous two components to analyse ACs' ability and capacity to maintain the dimensions indicated in the cooperative triangle while also fostering environmental sustainability through their practices. © 2020},

    abstract = {In recent years, China witnessed a boom in the formation of agricultural cooperatives. While most of them have been set up as agricultural service cooperatives, there is also the option of forming agricultural production cooperatives (APCs). Although both models stem from a similar long tradition, it was argued that production cooperatives were not competitive, thus having no role in agricultural development. Historically, these cooperatives were formed under specific conditions only. However, in recent years, they have been observed in villages characterised by family agriculture. Taking the example of Chongzhou County (Sichuan Province, China), this exploratory study investigates the salient conditions under which farmers voluntarily join such cooperatives. The results show that APCs still have a role to play in agricultural development after all. Certain conditions have to be met, like government support and recruitment of professional farm managers, but particularly a homogeneous membership and transparent decision-making processes. © The Author(s) 2020.},

    abstract = {While there is general consensus regarding the urgent need for sustainability transitions in food and agriculture, tensions exist regarding how to best stimulate and manage them. Generally, there are two competing agrifood governance models for advancing sustainability: technocratic and deliberative democratic procedures. Taking up Fischer’s (Citizens, experts, and the environment: The politics of local knowledge, Duke University Press, Durham, 2000) call to develop new ways of bringing citizens and experts together in governance, this paper examines an integrative sustainability governance system that uses both technocratic and deliberative procedures. Drawing on a case study of a Japanese consumer cooperative, Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative, this paper analyzes the ways that technocratic and deliberative governance procedures use different forms of knowledge, measure and assess sustainability differently, and produce different outcomes. The analysis finds that whereas technocratic forms of governance are most effective at monitoring, verification, and compliance assurance, deliberative processes facilitate relationships, mutual understanding, and commitment among stakeholders. For sustainability governance to address not only the technical but also social dimensions of sustainability, the findings on Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative’s integrative governance system support the need for deliberative procedures. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

    abstract = {Jurisprudence is a philosophy of law through which legal concepts, design of legal and regulatory frameworks, and historical backgrounds of legal systems are understood. In that perspective, this study discusses jurisprudential theories of regulation of financial cooperative societies in Tanzania with specific concentration to Primary SACCOS’ Credit Advancement (PSCA). The discussed theories are; natural law theory, social contract theory, command- and-control theory, sociological theory, law and economic theory, legal instrumentalism theory, and market failure theory. It is important to note however that, market failure theory is not yet adopted as a jurisprudential theory rather it is a general economic theory of regulation. It is therefore suggested in this study that, market failure theory is to be adopted as one amongst jurisprudential theories of regulation. Its adoption promises the better and conducive legal and regulatory framework for not only effectiveness of PSCA but also sustainability of other economic activities in the country. Because, market failure theory has an essential nature of positively impact changes from traditionally rigid and hyper-regulation form of legal and regulatory frameworks to more market friendly regulatory culture. This change is highly looked-for. © 2020 BiLD Law Journal. All rights reserved.},

Structural behavior of frames build from Araucaria angustifolia glued boards and vegetable oil-based polyurethane adhesive was evaluated. Tests were carried out to characterize wood and adhesive to obtain verification/sizing parameters. Initially, a full-scale structural project was conducted to meet standard laying poultry house specifications. Afterwards, five units of straight three-articulated frames on a 1:2.5 reduced scale were designed, built, and subjected to strength tests until breaking. They were built with a 2-meter free span and a 15° slope, suitable for using metal roof tiles. The average for structure ultimate strength was 4.14 times the design load. Structures had satisfactory mechanical performance and displacements lower than those recommended by NBR 7190 (1997) standard (ABNT). Therefore, building glued frames with Parana pine boards and vegetable oil-based glue is technically feasible. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agricola.},

Moreover, the case studies reveal that downstream agribusiness agents, who normally oppose farmers’ countervailing power, promote, support, and even initiate cooperatives and farmer groups, in order to implement food safety standards.

The information was collected through a questionnaire applied to controllers or equivalent (accountants / controllers), who inquired about the characteristics of the cooperatives, the control practices used and the level of importance attributed to them, as well as Identify the stage of the organizational life cycle of these entities. The results showed that the practices of the "1" and "2" stages were the most used / valued by the respondents, since the average levels of use (62% and 64.67%, respectively) approached those of importance 65.00% and 72.25%). However, those practices belonging to the "3" and "4" stages were effectively underused and less valued by the Controllers, since the average degrees of importance (42.75% and 47.25%, respectively) exceeded the respective average levels of Use (9.67% and 13.67%). Also, with regard to the life cycle, evidence has been found that leads us to believe in the association of the practices used in the life stages of these cooperatives, especially those classified in the "Maturity" phases ("D", "E" and "F" And "Maturity / Decline" ("A" and "C"), but less evident in those in the "Maturity / Growth" stratum ("B" and "G"). © 2020, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

Design/methodology/approach: By assuming the utility maximization behavior of farmers, based on data collected from 539 fruit and vegetable producers, this study estimates an intention to participate and a willingness to pay model. Findings: Three groups of factors determine the utility the farmers derive and subsequently their engagement in brand development. Farm business characteristics include farmers’ age, the attainment of quality certification and cultivated area, while psychological factors include farmers’ attitudes toward local reflections of the brand, perceptions regarding the need for farm business external support and consumers’ interest, as well as farmers’ commitment to quality requirements. Farmers’ strategies related to the share of products sold by cooperatives and to individually use the brand also determine their engagement in a brand development scheme. Research limitations/implications: Future research should distinguish producers according to the marketing channel they choose and their industry, and explore the intentions of intermediate marketers. Practical implications: Marketing cooperatives should undertake initiatives to develop local brands effectively, taking into consideration the factors that impact farmers’ engagement, while food marketing firms should properly adapt their purchasing and promotion strategies. Public authorities should formulate a policy mix that enhances farmers’ knowledge related to marketing issues and encourages farmers to strengthen their positions in the marketplace. Originality/value: The research reveals a strategic proactive behavior of farmers favoring the development of local brands, and provides insights into the factors that impact farmers’ adoption decisions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency in financial intermediation and the cost efficiency in banking service of credit unions in Brazil, based on essentially accounting variables, and to analyze the temporal evolution of the efficiency of these cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: With a sample of 315 cooperatives over the period from 2007 to 2014, this research uses a two-stage process: application of regression models with panel data to verify which variables are related to the defined outputs, with the reduction of 31 variables to 8 variables in both models; and application of the data envelopment analysis method to obtain an analysis of credit unions’ efficiency. Findings: The results demonstrate a high level of efficiency in financial intermediation, with low variation over time, associated with a low efficiency in the banking service, in which few cooperatives have remained efficient over time. In addition, the cooperatives with highest efficiency in financial intermediation were also the most efficient in providing services. Research limitations/implications: This research has some limitations about the capacity of the proxies used to capture the real effect of the variables and assumptions of economic relations resulting in restrictions to generalize the results. Practical implications: Cooperatives are usually analyzed under just one dimension. By separating the analysis into financial intermediation and banking services, cooperatives that are more efficient in each dimension can be identified, in addition to analyzing the evolution over time. The authors found that efficiency tends to be lower in banking services, and few cooperatives remain at the highest level of efficiency over time in both models. Social implications: Credit unions provide an important service in the banking and credit market. Therefore, understanding its operation and the characteristics that influence its efficiency allows a better management of the cooperatives themselves and a greater understanding of this important segment of the financial market. © 2020, Manuela Gonçalves Barros, Marcelo Botelho da Costa Moraes, Alexandre Pereira Salgado Junior and Marco Antonio Alves de Souza Junior.},

In conclusion, the de lege ferenda postulates regarding credit unions' regulation in Poland are presented. Credit unions in Poland conduct not for profit business activity only with their members with reservation to mediating in specific contracts on financial market which can be also conducted with nonmembers. Credit unions activity is subject to supervision of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (FSA). Therefore credit unions regulation is characterized by duality of legal regime of private and administrative law. However, in certain fields of credit unions activity the FSA's supervision, performed under administrative legal regime, raises justified doubts in the light of the principle of cooperative autonomy as the FSA by law has the authority to impose specific orders and prohibitions on credit unions. © 2020 University of Deusto.

The representative farms for each region were defined at meetings with sheep farmers and technicians via the rapid appraisal methodology and represent 65% of the state’s flock. The information of each representative farm was collected between March 2015 and February 2016. Principal component analysis was used to verify the relationships among the different variables that characterized the farms. These characteristics were: number of ewes (V1), total cost per kilogram of revenue-generating product (V2), feeding costs (V3), labor costs (V4), facility and equipment depreciation costs (V5), and gross margin in the production cycle (V6). Cluster analysis was performed, resulting in three distinct groups: one including eight, another seven, and the third, nine farms. The results aided in classifying the farms into groups with similar characteristics, such as production scale, reproductive efficiency, technical and managerial control, appreciation of cooperatives, and availability of continuous technical assistance. The production scale, reproductive and productive efficiency, adoption of technologies, and cooperative organizational structure can be emphasized as positive performance benchmarks and were the most important aspects to achieve positive economic results. © This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we consider a downstream firm negotiating with an upstream firm, and we investigate the impact of the organizational form of the upstream firm. We show that if the upstream firm is organized like a traditional cooperative, where the members have free delivery rights and where surplus is shared in proportion to the deliveries, the downstream firm is less subject to a holdup. The cooperative form makes it possible for the upstream firm to credibly commit to deliveries. Traditional cooperatives are often considered as suffering from a volume management problem, which leads to excessive deliveries. Remedying this problem is the objective of the so-called new generation cooperatives. In a supply chain context, however, this problem may actually be beneficial. Specifically, it limits the upstream firm's ability to hold up the downstream firm, which in turn makes possible specific downstream investments that are closer to first best. Our model lends structure to several real-world phenomena, including the apparent success of marketing cooperatives in farming, the success of open-end mutual funds, and the organization of aggregators in the new economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper studies the initial organisation and subsequent transformation of the socio-technical assemblage or ‘agencement’ around wind power in Denmark, focusing on the changing roles and agency of electricity producers. We propose a conceptual model for mapping the transformation over time, following five entangled dimensions: capitalisation instruments, turbine technology, capital investment, regulation of finance and ownership modes. We show how changes in all five socio-material dimensions have produced a ‘paradigm shift’, reconfiguring wind power from a distributed power source to critical infrastructure. This shift has marginalised local players and mobilised new types of producers and ownership forms. Using the conceptual model, we map the controversy resulting from the paradigm shift. Our relational lens of market studies within Science & Technology Studies captures how wind power’s ‘sustainability’ has become contested, and how this cannot be understood as a matter of ‘community acceptance’ dissociated from material factors. Proposing our conceptual model for future studies, we contribute not only to the extant social acceptance literature, but also to critical energy debates on the governance of climate change and sustainability. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {Shifting from a linear to a circular economy in the agrifood domain requires innovative business models, including reverse logistics, new visions on customer-supplier relationships, and new forms of organization and marketing strategies at the crossroads of various value chains. This research aims to identify and characterise different types of business models that create value from agricultural waste and by-products via cascading or closing loops. Conceptual and management insights into circular business models are still sparse. In total, 39 cases have been studied that convert agro-waste and by-products into valuable products via a circular economy approach. Semi-structured interviews and on-site visits of six representative cases have been done, and secondary data been collected. Data has been treated with content analysis. Cases are presented according to the type of organisational structure, resources, transformation processes, value propositions, key partners, customers, strategic approaches and innovation. Six types of circular business models are identified and discussed: biogas plant, upcycling entrepreneurship, environmental biorefinery, agricultural cooperative, agropark and support structure. They differ in their way of value creation and organisational form, but strongly depend on partnerships and their capacity to respond to changing external conditions. This study offers the first circular business model typology within the agricultural domain, revealing the interconnectedness of the six different business model types. It provides options for managers in positioning and adapting their business strategies. It highlights the potential of using biomass first for higher added-value products before exploiting it as energy source. Cascading biomass valorisation at a territorial level will increasingly be important for locally cooperating actors within a circular bioeconomy approach. © 2020 The Authors},

    abstract = {Accurate and early estimation of citrus yields is important for both producers and agricultural cooperatives to be competitive and make informed decisions when selling their products. Yield estimation is key for predicting stock volumes, avoiding stock ruptures and planning harvesting operations. Visual yield estimations have traditionally been employed, resulting in inaccurate and misleading information. The main goal of this study was to develop an automated image processing methodology to detect, count and estimate the size of citrus fruits on individual trees using deep learning techniques. During 3 consecutive annual campaigns, a total of 20 trees from a commercial citrus grove were monitored using images captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). These trees were harvested manually, and fruit sizes were measured. A Faster R-CNN Deep Learning model was trained using a custom dataset to detect oranges in the obtained images. An average standard error (SE) of 6.59 % was obtained between visual counting and the model's fruit detection. Using the detected fruits, fruit size estimation was also performed. The promising results obtained indicate that this size estimation method can be employed for size discrimination prior to harvest. A model based on Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) was trained for yield estimation per tree and for a total yield estimation. The actual and estimated yields per tree were compared, resulting in an approximate error of SE = 4.53 % and a standard deviation of SD = 0.97 Kg. The actual total yield, the estimated total yield and the total yield estimated by an expert technician were compared. The error in the estimation by the technician was SE = 13.74 %, while the errors in the model were SE = 7.22 % and SD = 4083.58 Kg. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the present technique to provide yield estimates for citrus fruits or even other types of fruit. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {This study investigates the factors influencing the financial performance of 1,766 agricultural cooperatives in Thailand by applying the DuPont analysis framework. Financial performance, measured using ROE (return on equity), was decomposed to three contributing factors, viz., profitability, asset efficiency, and financial leverage. Linear regression and quantile regression analyses were employed to respectively estimate the conditional mean and conditional quantiles. Profitability was found to be the strongest driver of ROE. Asset efficiency and financial leverage were also positive contributors to ROE. An alternative regression model was carried out, where the financial performance construct ROE was replaced with ROA (return on assets). The findings suggest that increasing leverage leads to decreasing performance, contradicting the earlier results. This implies that whether leverage hurts or benefits performance can depend on the variable choice. Employed as control variables, location and age were found to be associated with performance. In particular, the cooperatives in the central region, in general, appeared to have the lowest financial performance. The study empirically pointed out that negative equity led to violations of the ordinal and interpretable properties of ROE. Thus, ROE components should be carefully examined. Regarding cooperative management policy, cooperatives should concentrate on both operating and financial performances with the priority given to profitability, which involves the efficiencies of cost and sales management. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press},

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the relation between governance and financial efficiency of credit unions in Brazil. The study shows how poor financial efficiency in credit unions may result from undesirable configurations in executive management and other variables related to governance. Design/methodology/approach: The study develops an innovative methodology to classify credit unions according to the level of governance using indicators of representativeness and participation, leadership, management and supervision. This methodology integrates the use of multiple correspondence and cluster analysis. The study then applies stochastic frontier models to analyze how governance affects the indicators of financial efficiency. Findings: The results highlight that better governance substantially increases the efficiency of credit unions in terms of a higher level of credit operations per institution. Originality/value: The paper uses a pioneering survey applied by the Central Bank to almost the total population of credit unions in Brazil. The results highlight how to operationalize a subjective and broad concept related to cooperative governance to identify the remarkable impacts of good governance practices on the financial efficiency of credit unions. © 2020, Ricardo Terranova Favalli, Alexandre Gori Maia and Jose Maria Ferreira Jardim da Silveira.},

    abstract = {There are repeated calls for the reform of Islamic banking and finance from academic economists. Critics assert that Islamic financial institutions are simply replicating conventional banks and ignoring Sharīʿah teachings. There is a very critical rhetoric on Islamic banking practice, but this is expounded without examining the facts on the ground. In contrast, in this evidence-based investigation the activities of three leading Islamic banks are examined, Al Rajhi Bank, Maybank Islamic, and Meezan Bank. All three are found to have reputable scholars on their Sharīʿah boards to ensure compliance with Islamic law. These institutions are incorporated as listed companies rather than being mutual or co-operative organizations as some Islamic economists advocate. Being a limited liability company ensures they can raise risk capital and conform to international regulations which are enforced by central banks. The three case studies reveal that the banks have been innovative in the deposit facilities offered as well as in their financing methods. Much of their financing is through leasing for vehicle acquisition and residential mortgages. Although focused on retail customers, the banks also provide commercial and investment banking services for companies and finance for small and medium sized enterprises. In summary, far from being broken, Islamic banks provide helpful financing for modern economies. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

    abstract = {If a group of horizontal rivals gets together to agree on a way to structure efficient production, are they violating competition law? The issue could arise where a group of producers of agricultural products gets together to form a cooperative or even where professionals in the same field get together in a partnership. On the face of it, each supply agreement between the producer and the cooperative or partnership is vertical, but the design of the collective rules, which govern for all, involves horizontal coordination. This article takes as the starting point the example of dairy cooperatives as they emerged in the later part of the nineteenth century as a solution to a challenge offered by new technology. We use the landmark contract law case of McEllistrim v. Ballymacelligott Cooperative to illustrate the ways in which competition law could be engaged when cooperatives are formed. Comparisons of Ireland and Denmark in the period leading up to the decision suggest that not only might the restraint be ancillary, but if not, it reduced costs, increased quality, and was welcomed by consumers (though these were in England rather than in Denmark or Ireland). The restraint also appears essential in some form, suggesting that either ancillarity or the application of Art. 101(3) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union would have allowed the restraint to be used. © The Author(s) 2020.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the perception of farmers toward the possibility to develop agricultural cooperatives through subak in an upcoming tourism destination. This study was carried out in Subak Jatiluwih in Bali, Indonesia, which has been designated by the UNESCO as one of the sites that became the World Cultural Heritage. Data were collected through interviews with 70 farmers using a structured questionnaire that was tested previously and through focus group discussion (FGD) during the period of June to August 2018. Perceptions of farmers were reviewed from indicators of knowledge and attitudes and measured using each of the 20 statements using a Likert scale. Data were then analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results show that perceptions of farmers toward the possibility of developing agricultural cooperatives through subak are within good category. When farmers have good perception, it is expected that the process of developing agricultural cooperatives through subak can be realized quickly and synergized with tourism businesses. © 2020, ASERS Publishing House.

Six informants were selected through a purposive sampling method.

This operationalisation of the dimensions fits with the identity of cooperatives. Smallholders’ cooperative performance is summarised as the ability to conduct the process of basic management tasks in an efficient and effective manner as well as conform to the expectations of its members. The originality of this study lies in its attempt to investigate the concept of performance using the pragmatic understanding of top management in line with the mental model.

    abstract = {Global trade in niche commodities has increased the influence of consumers' choices on land use change and livelihoods in developing rural areas. New niche commodity markets for fine cocoa—produced by old tree varieties frequently grown in shaded agroforestry systems—create more direct linkages between producers and buyers. We explored the socioeconomic and environmental outcomes for cocoa smallholders that participated in direct trade relations compared with smallholders that sold through mainstream markets. Household interviews were conducted with cocoa smallholders in northern Ecuador. Biodiversity conditions at farm level were monitored for 75% of surveyed households. Using a counterfactual based on genetic matching, we found that smallholders engaged in direct trade (a) captured superior prices for cocoa sales; (b) had greater access to agricultural training, technical assistance, and improved social networks; and (b) applied more nature-friendly management practices, compared with smallholders selling through mainstream markets. However, a strong overlap between direct trading practices and organic certification made attribution of environmental benefits difficult. This overlap likely explained why farmers engaged in direct trade used more organic fertilizers and less herbicide. Shade level and plant species richness and abundance in plantations were unrelated to market participation. Additional qualitative analyses suggest that certification facilitates engagement in direct trade and that some direct buyers request certification. This study provides insights on the potential of developing value chain innovations for high-quality commodity trade. The success of value chain innovations hinges on the competitiveness of farmers' cooperatives and involvement of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private actors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

This research aims to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) of farmers in the GAP-Harran Plain for services that would ensure sustainable agricultural income, the factors affecting their willingness, and the minimum amount they would be willing to pay. The main material of the research has been obtained by means of face-to-face surveys involving farmers selected by a simple random sampling method in the GAP-Harran Plain. The sampling volume was determined with a 95% confidence limit and a 5% error margin. Heckman’s two-stage model was used for the analysis. According to the results of the research, 22.61% of the participants showed WTP, and the average amount they were willing to pay was 180.82 TL/hectare (ha) ($31.86/ha). This amount was 3.08% of the average annual agricultural income calculated. About 41.22% of the participants showed no WTP. They believed that the public sector is accountable of the services and consequently, they should be provided free of charge. About 23.14% of the participants showed WTP only for the services that they needed. The average WTP for all participants was calculated as 40.9 TL/ha ($7.21/ha) and 1.2 million $/year for the GAP-Harran Plain. This amount is the minimum and may increase by several folds with a demand-based variety of service delivery. The factors that statistically effect WTP have been determined as age, education, experience, number of households working in agriculture, amount of land, agricultural income, non-agricultural income, membership status of agricultural cooperatives, and product pattern. The results provide useful information to guide researchers, decision-makers, and policy-makers. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

A two-level factorial experiment was initially implemented using differently conditioned rice straw types, rice straw feed rates, and drying airflow rates. Optimization results using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) showed there is no significant difference in the drying air efficiency using either loose or baled straw. The optimum conditions found were at a rice straw feed rate of 20.67 kg h−1 and drying airflow rate of 3.03 m3 s−1, resulting in a drying air efficiency of 86.1%, and an increase in drying air temperature of 18.41 °C which was sufficient for paddy drying applications. At the optimum conditions, the average CO and NOx concentrations measured inside the dryer simulator were 76.57 and 2.93 ppm, respectively.

    abstract = {In this time of the pandemic, nothing is as it used to be. This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor. A truly resilient global food system implies not only preparedness for coming shocks and changes but also a foundation that makes shocks less probable and critical. © 2020, The Author(s).},

However, the success of these cooperatives depends on their ability to maintain their social capital, which is at the core of collective action. A few studies have addressed issues of member participation, commitment, and trust, yet less is known about rural cooperatives in developing countries as a social organization. It is also unclear whether a relationship exists between cooperative size and the incidence of conflict, fraud, and distrust. Using unique data collected from 511 agricultural cooperatives in 12 districts of Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of cooperative size on conflict, fraud, and distrust. We used instrumental variables (IV) probit estimation techniques, accounting for endogeneity of membership size, to confirm that cooperative size does affect the occurrence of conflict, fraud, and trust. The results also indicate that other influencing factors include: cooperative age, number of employees, payment of dividends based on transaction volume, and heterogeneity of member goals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Community-based wildlife conservation (CBWC) programmes have been a pervasive paradigm in the conservation circles since the 1970s. The key elements of such programmes are that local communities are given ownership rights or custodianship and management responsibilities over wildlife, and that they gain social and economic benefits from conservation of the resources. However, to date, there have been only a few studies that offer in-depth analyses of the interplay between governance processes and livelihood impacts of CBWC programmes. Here, I conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions in five wildlife conservancies in the Maasai Mara ecosystem in Kenya to address the following questions: i) What are the perceived impacts of the wildlife conservancies on livelihoods of the local people? ii) To what extent are the wildlife conservancies governed in relation to the principles of environmental governance? I assessed impacts on livelihoods by applying the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to explore perceived conservancy-related benefits and costs (i.e. perceived changes in social, financial, human, physical, and natural capitals). I assessed governance by asking the respondents whether the following eight principles of environmental governance were applied: legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, integration, capability, and adaptability. Perceived benefits of participating in wildlife co-management were identified as: enhanced income from gainful employment and new business opportunities, membership to cooperative societies and participation in community work (e.g. school bursary and feeding programmes), enhanced social relations, improved access to credit and health facilities, enhanced physical infrastructure (schools, roads and bridges), improved physical security and coordinated sharing of provisioning ecosystem services like pasture and water. The principles of legitimacy, inclusiveness, and integration had reportedly been well implemented in wildlife co-management. However, the institutional mechanisms for sharing resources within the conservancies lacked transparency, accountability, and fairness, and tended to favour those who were politically connected to the leadership of the conservancies. Moreover, most of the conservancies had weak systems and few resources to facilitate delivery on responsibilities (i.e. had low capability), and had some costs associated with human-wildlife conflicts. For an improved co-management of wildlife to be achieved in these conservancies, local institutions should be reconfigured to allow active participation by conservancy landowners in decision-making, information sharing, and equitable access to conservancy-related benefits. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Sustainable transport is an important way of mitigating climate change. Inland navigation still is a sustainable mode of transport which is of great importance for the whole European transport market. However, due to its market structure, it risks losing the battle for volume and market share with the other transportation modes. Opting for inductive research approach, this paper first of all collects data. Next, the paper observes the market of the European inland navigation sector and looks for patterns in order to develop a set of structural pathways. From the data collection, it turns out that the sector is facing challenges, mainly due to overcapacity, uncontrolled costs and volatile freight prices. The classical reaction pattern to overcome these shortcomings (capacity control, cost control, playing with ‘time’ and ‘reliability’ factors) does no longer suffice. By analyzing the patterns, the researchers were able to formulate five pathways: A first path is that of technological/operational innovation or retrofitting for ecological and social sustainability. A second path is that of industrial economics: inland navigation is marked by a lot of fragmentation. A solution might be pooling up, whereby the risk of anti-competitive impacts seems very low. A third path is that of financing: the classical financing through banks clearly provides no incentive for reducing overcapacity, even not through bankruptcies. Actual lay-up of vessels seems a must. For longer-run financing, bonds, credit unions or even crowd-funding can be solutions. A fourth path builds on the second one, with more co-operation needed within the wider sector, also with vertically-related partners: charterers, terminal operators, etc. Fifth and finally, a dynamic regulation is needed, following modern rules, with an eye on the longer-term viability of the sector. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

The purpose of this article was to develop a theoretical framework for the development of women social entrepreneurs in Japan. There were two guiding questions in this study: How and in what ways women social entrepreneurship are developed in Japan? and What life events affect the values and beliefs that drive them to take authentic entrepreneurial careers for social change? The Solution: We explored the connection between women social entrepreneurship, authentic leadership, and transformative learning theories in the context of Japan through an extensive literature review. The proposed theoretical framework could be used to show the role of critical reflection in face of triggering life events and factors that support or hinder in becoming women social entrepreneurs. The Stakeholders: We focused on Japanese women whose social enterprises aim for social benefits operating through a variety of forms including not-for-profits (NPOs), small businesses, cooperative organizations, and worker collectives. © The Author(s) 2020.},

This study examines the relationship between the extent of privatization and the various forms of demographic growth that were permissible under the new classification and their impact on the perceived sustainability of the kibbutz in these communal communities. We collected data at the kibbutz level via interviews with community managers and at the individual level through questionnaires among community members in 19 kibbutzim. We employed the “nearest neighbor” methodology to create pairs who were demographically eligible for a before and after comparison. Although our results about perceived sustainability suggest that kibbutzim across the board have overcome the struggle to survive and have been able to recover, unlike commonly assumed, changes they adopted in the direction of more privatization and diversified statuses are clearly correlated with smaller increases in levels of perceived sustainability. Our findings may offer lessons for wider sociological questions concerning processes of privatization and stratification. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

    abstract = {Although purely economic (conventional)reasons play a significant role in the development and performance of (agricultural)cooperatives; so do other (non-conventional)factors. A comprehensive assessment of co-operatives therefore requires an examination of non-conventional factors, in addition to the conventional factors. Three such non-conventional factors identified in the literature are 1)commitment, 2)heterogeneity and 3)social capital. Commitment is important for agricultural co-operatives because one pre-requisite for successful agricultural co-operatives is that farmer-members are willing to supply the co-operative with raw products, capital and managerial inputs. In this research affective, continuance, normative and other aspects of member commitment are examined. Heterogeneity is an important source of concern for co-operatives due to its impact on cohesiveness and collective decision making. This study used characteristics associated with the farmer-member and the farm-business to examine heterogeneity. It has been suggested that the social capital paradigm is the common denominator for all explanations and theories on co-operative formation and development. A modified version of the six dimensions’ framework used by the World Bank to assess social capital was used in this study. Based on this theoretical underpinning, a Three Dimensional Conceptual Framework, that encapsulates commitment, heterogeneity and social capital is developed and described. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This heterogeneity, coupled with a large growth in the number of cooperatives in the country, offers an interesting perspective to study the determinants of the (in)efficiency of cooperatives. In this paper, we analyse the performance of Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives, focusing on the degree of technical (in)efficiency and its determinants. We use the stochastic frontier approach in which we account for heteroskedasticity and the monotonicity of production functions, presenting a methodological improvement with respect to previous technical efficiency studies. The results show that NGO- and government-initiated cooperatives are less efficient than community-initiated ones, implying that governments and NGOs should not interfere too strongly in cooperative formation. Cooperatives with a high degree of heterogeneity in members’ participation are found to be about 98% less efficient, while cooperatives that have paid employees are 33% more efficient. Besides, results show that cooperatives in Ethiopia function more efficiently if they incentivize committee members through monetary compensation. © 2019, © 2019 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

But the penetration of structural inequalities is limited, because the female workers of the society remain low-income laborers, social boundary and exclusion still take place, and the workers internalize their cultural inferiority. In comparison with innovative organizations in other regions, workers’ co-operative societies in Hong Kong have little opportunity to rely on or collaborate with the public and private sectors, and they explore a more progressive path of penetration in development.

    abstract = {Fusarium spp. are one of the most widespread mycotoxin-producing fungi in small-grain cereals like wheat. Their rate of infection and production of mycotoxins is mainly influenced by weather and pre-harvest agronomic measures. Consequently, farmers' prevention and control of mycotoxins are imperative since it is difficult to remove mycotoxins further down the cereal supply chain. This study aimed to (i)identify which pre-harvest preventive and control measures Dutch wheat farmers currently apply against Fusarium spp. infection and mycotoxin contamination and to (ii)examine which farm and farmer characteristics explain the implementation of these measures. Field data on pre-harvest measures, like the selection of resistant varieties, fungicide use, and crop rotation, along with farm and farmer characteristics were collected from Dutch wheat farmers via an online questionnaire. Probit models were applied to examine farm and farmer characteristics that explain the implementation of pre-harvest measures. Results showed that most farmers applied six or more different measures against Fusarium spp. infection and mycotoxin contamination in wheat and that the use of pre-harvest measures is related to at least one other measure. However, results indicated that about 44% of farmers could become more effective if they implemented a benchmark approach consisting of a combination of fungicide use during flowering, selection of a Fusarium resistant wheat variety, and plowing or crop rotation. Five out of the ten evaluated farm and farmer characteristics significantly (p < 0.05)explained the implementation of at least one of the eight pre-harvest control measures. These five farm and farmer characteristics include wheat as main income crop, the use of a decision support system, the education level of the farmer, the farmer's knowledge about mycotoxins, and the farmer's level of risk aversion. Insight into relevant characteristics can be used by farmer cooperatives, processing industries and government agencies to improve the overall mycotoxin management of wheat farmers. © 2019 The Authors},

Moisture, protein content, runoff time, viscosity, pH, wort clarity, extract content and diastatic power were determined in the tested malt, as well as wort obtained from it in the process of mashing. The average parameters of protein content, extractivity of malt ground into flour, of pH and the wort extract were normative, while the other researched parameters did not meet high quality requirements. A high loss of grain mass was noted during malting.

It combines the south and South-East Asia with five countries of SAARC and two countries of ASEAN. BIMSTEC is a sector-driven cooperative organisation with key areas of economic cooperation include trade, investment, regional value chains, energy, connectivity, technology, management and capacity building, people to people contact, among others. Even after two decades of existence, BIMSTEC achieved limited progress as India the largest member of the group showed little interest in it. But the failure of SAARC as an effective sub-regional economic integration in Asia and the incorrigible differences between India and Pakistan, the two largest economies of SAARC led to the rethinking and resurrection of BIMSTEC in the recent past. India's strategic interests in the Himalayan, Bay of Bengal and Mekong sub-regions have grown over the years and the expansionist tendencies of China in these regions led to India's renewed engagements with BIMSTEC. In this context, the paper looks into the trade relation between India and BIMSTEC countries and identified the unexplored trade potential and possible areas of cooperation between India and BIMSTEC countries. The trade impact of the likely India BIMSTEC Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) is ascertained using partial equilibrium simulation model. Indicators such as Trade Intensity Index (TII) and Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) showed hat there is trade complementary existing between India and BIMSTEC countries and the possibility of enhanced economic cooperation between them. The SMART simulation showed that there is trade creation from a potential India BIMSTEC FTA for the participating countries. The simulation analysis also revealed that the total trade effect of India BIMSTEC RTA was 2.369 billion US dollars, total welfare was 267.044 million dollars and the trade creation was 412.2 thousand US dollars. © 2019 The Society of Economics and Development.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance of banking institutions in Costa Rica over the period 2004–2014. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs system GMM, dynamic panel data and traditional financial hypothesis framework to analyze bank performance and assess marketplace sustainability for a sample of commercial and cooperative banks from Costa Rica. In the assessment, the authors visit the relative market power, structure conduct performance (SCP) and efficient structure literature. Findings: Market share (MS) is positively related to performance whereas the authors find a negative effect of market concentration (Herfindahl–Hirschman index) on bank profits, thereby refuting the SCP hypothesis. The authors accept the “quiet life” hypothesis within Costa Rican banks since a moderate level of profit persistence is detected. Commercial banks are less profitable. Yet when crisis is introduced to the models, it has a significant and negative impact on overall bank performance. Research limitations/implications: The authors selected years and banks based on available data plus default information in the relevant database. More insights can be gained from post-2014 developments. Practical implications: The current results and conclusions have implications for developing economies (and economic development, in general) by showing that the traditional understanding of cooperative bank model as better for the public good may not be necessarily true. They offer insight into the understanding of how different bank-type institutions affect the public good. Furthermore, expanding the research to Latin America in order to directly compare commercial and cooperative enterprises via a meta-frontier technique would help buttress this evidence. Originality/value: This is the most recent study to provide such an investigation for a Latin American country with a sizable MS for cooperative and public sector banks.

By contrast, MFI Z-scores, notably those of MFI banks, credit unions and other MFIs, are driven by largely the same factors as bank Z-scores. The difference in results can be linked to the special characteristics of credit technologies pursued by MFIs.

The apparent resilience of Nordic democracy has sometimes been partly attributed to the strength of the popular movements, the internal democratic structures, and culture of these organizations and not least their role in educating their members in democratic practices. Drawing primarily on examples from the co-operative movements in several Nordic countries, the article asks how democracy was understood in co-operative societies and how it functioned in practice. Co-operative societies were committed to the principle of ‘one member one vote’, but faced constant dilemmas over how to combine the possibility for grassroots influence with the need for central control, especially as the organizations grew in size. In some cases, this led to irreconcilable conflicts and splits in central organizations. The article argues that although the co-operatives and other popular movements later came to be seen as crucial elements in the survival of Nordic democracy, their role in this survival should not be taken for granted. © The Author(s) 2019.},

    abstract = {In spite of many initiatives to set up community or farmer-group-based seed production, there is little empirical evidence about the group functioning in producing and marketing quality seed. This article therefore aims to contribute to better understanding of the process and practice of seed potato cooperatives’ formation and operation in Chencha, Ethiopia. Our study specifically focused on why and how farmer groups organize, produce and market quality seed potato. We collected primary data from two seed potato cooperatives in three phases through interviews, focus group discussions, and field assessment and store inventories on bacterial wilt incidence. We found that the support to the establishing of the two seed potato cooperatives focused more on improving the members’ seed potato production capacity and less on building good governance in the seed chain. The experiences showed the tensions between prescriptive rules, collective action and individual interests which made it very hard to maintain quality seed standards and friendship at the same time. In general, the root of having weak seed cooperatives may not be the lack of intent towards building durable farmer groups. Rather, development practitioners did not take the set-up of strong farmer groups as an evolving process, which continually engages in diagnosis and responds to the emerging social as well as material challenges. The set-up of farmer-group-based seed production, therefore, needs to shift from ‘standard production models’ to an evolving model: an open and flexible model guided by trials, challenges and existing socio-technical and institutional realities. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

    abstract = {The production of corn as the second most important cereal crops after rice is dominated by smallholders, particularly in West Kalimantan. However, smallholders in farmer cooperatives are unsustainable because of the lack of decision-making power at the grassroots level; limited access to land, capital, technologies, information and financial services; low market competitiveness; weak management; and limited policy and socio-cultural norms. This research aims to construct the behavior model for performance change of cooperative farmers in Rasau Jaya, Kubu Raya district, West Kalimantan. It involved 75 smallholders recruited using purposive sampling technique. In-depth interviews using the structural equation modeling/SEM based on the new institutional approach and the theory of planned behavior were used in the study. The findings proved that intentions and past behaviors have positive and negative influence on farmers' cooperative behavior, but contradicted with control. Therefore, there are several efforts for changing the behavior in corn farmers’cooperatives, i.e. the perceived behavioral control can stimulate the motivation to be long-lived performing based on the resources and opportunities; pro-environmental behavior needs to engage a supportive injunctive norm and a supportive descriptive norm; a subjective norm for motivation to exhibitthe positive experiential attitude; and the confidence to perform and control their performance. © 2021 Ecological Society of India.

The paper addresses the gap with study findings which assessed role of agricultural marketing co-operatives (AMCOS) in socio-economic development and challenges they face in Moshi district council. A multiple case study design was adapted using 10 AMCOS where a total 80 respondents were involved and both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Primary quantitative and qualitative data were collected through self-questionnaire administration and Focus Group Discussion (FGDs), respectively and secondary data were collected through documentary review. Quantitative data were analysed using multiple response analysis while qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Theoretical ground of the paper based on Cook’s Life Cycle Model of Agricultural Co-operatives and Collective Action Theory. As for the results, despite challenges faced, AMCOS found to be viable organizations for socio-economic development where they operate. They also contribute to Government revenues and finance operations of supporting institutions in coffee industry. We recommend on the need for; improved management, coffee quality, business diversification and change in the business model. In addition, AMCOS should improve; farming techniques, enhance provision of co-operative and agricultural education and training as well as forming joint enterprises. © 2020, CEDDAR.

Well-managed mutual aid teams and co-ops could improve the efficiency of input allocation, help to increase the use of traditional inputs, and accelerate the diffusion of output-enhancing technologies. The case of the Guo Yu’en co-op in Chuandi village illustrates how institutions providing sufficient work incentives could emerge in rural communities.

In the centers of financial power in both the United States and the United Kingdom, proposals now circulate to give workers and the public more say over how flows of credit are allocated. This article examines five democratization proposals: credit union franchises, public investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, inclusive ownership funds, and bank nationalization. It considers how these plans might activate worker and public engagement in decision making about finance by focusing on three modes of public participation: representative democracy, direct democracy, and deliberative minipublics. It then considers the degree to which democratization plans might be resilient to de-democratization threats from business. It argues that of the five, bank nationalization goes furthest in guarding against de-democratization threats but is still pocked with pitfalls if it relies solely on representative democracy. It argues that two criteria appear necessary for democratically durable alternatives: the active direct participation of workers and citizens and the weakening of businesses’ capacity for democratic retrenchment. © The Author(s) 2019.},

The transnational capitalist class has taken setbacks in its stride, while the Left flounders almost everywhere. No communist revolution has resulted in the capture of power by the working class. Now we are all confronted by a new, rapidly unfolding ecological crisis, the Anthropocene. I argue that the most effective response is to exit rather than attempt to overthrow capitalism and the hierarchical state by international revolution. Socialists in positions of authority in state institutions and capitalist enterprises can facilitate this process by enacting legislation that helps people to transition to new smaller-scale non-statist social units, such as producer-consumer co-operatives producing their own food and other essential services over time. Mobilizing the ideas of degrowth, anarching, and consumer-producer cooperatives in the digital age, I argue that under Anthropocene conditions democratic socialism is best constructed from the bottom up, community by community, networked in mutually nurturing relationships. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {Banana is an important commercial fruit crop for smallholder farmers in Arba Minch, southern Ethiopia. However, its sector is experiencing many constraints and limited attention given to productivity and marketing. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the banana value chain in order to identify constraints on productivity and marketing, and possibilities of improvements towards a sustainable value chain in Arba Minch. Data were collected through a survey, key informants’ interviews, and focus group discussions. Different analytical and statistical tools were used for data analysis. Results describe actors, supporters, and influencers of the existing banana chain. The current banana chain has three different distribution channels in Arba Minch. The channel that connects with rural consumers has the highest value share for farmers while the channel that includes traveling traders has the lowest value share for farmers. The marketing cooperative channel has an intermediate value share for farmers in the chain. Poor agronomic practice, diseases, pests, and climate change were the major constraints for the banana yield while limited market information, lack of cold store and refrigerated trucks, poor post-harvest handling, lack of alternative markets, and weak capacity of cooperatives were the main constraints for banana marketing in Arba Minch. Economic, social and environmental indicators have a moderate sustainability performance within the Ethiopian context. The chain has an advantage in terms of profitability, employment, emission of air pollutants and constraints in terms of coordination, value share, profit margin, market diversity, product and market information, transportation, waste management, and safety and hygiene. © 2020 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The data set used in this study comes from four SACCOS audited financial reports from the year 2010 to 2014 and from interviews with SACCOS’s management. Findings: The study found that the IMFIs in Tanzania are not financially sustainable. Additionally, having responsible staff members, regular review of financial guidelines, education to members, cooperation between employees and management and staff training are found to be highly contributing factors towards SACCOS’s financial sustainability. Moreover, the findings reveal that depending on the single source of income, i.e., charges on members contributed much in these SACCOS’s not being financially sustainable. Research limitations/implications: Only two available registered Islamic SACCOS was used. Additionally, conventional SACCOS have been in service provision for a long time as compared to Islamic ones; hence, caution must be taken for comparison purposes. Practical implications: Based on these findings, the Islamic SACCOS needs to initiate productive projects that can enable them to have other income sources apart from charges on members. Originality/value: This study traces the financial trend of Islamic SACCOS in Tanzania since its establishment in 2010. Such trace enables Islamic SACCOS and other stakeholders to be aware on the financial progress of Islamic SACCOS and act accordingly to ensure sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Mariculture Sci-Tech parks promote modern mariculture and help improve China's mariculture industry. A park consists of a core area and a radiation area. The core area includes a farm, a cooperative, or a company, and the radiation area consists of many small farmers. Stochastic frontier analysis is employed to analyze the performance and its influencing factors of different governance structures in mariculture Sci-Tech parks. Results indicated the following: 1) Core areas show diminishing returns of scale, indicating that the increase in the scale of mariculture production can decrease the output. 2) The average technical efficiency of the core area is 0.4728, with the large family farms having the highest (0.4907), followed by the mariculture companies (0.4777) and the fish farmer cooperatives (0.4499). Several reasons can explain the difference in technical efficiency. First, family farms can better apply the new technology and new varieties to the mariculture production through moderate scale management. Second, companies have a higher operating cost, and the construction of mariculture Sci-Tech park has little effect on companies' performance. Third, cooperatives' advantage is not obvious in the organization management and the repeated construction of the infrastructure decreases utilization. 3) When the radiation area is considered, the input of large family farms has the most significant impact on the performance of the entire Sci-Tech park, with the highest driving efficiency. However, the cooperatives' driving efficiency is very poor, and the company performance is only reflected in the capital investment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the optimizing behavior of agricultural supply and marketing cooperatives in the US Midwestern states. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses firm-level data from CoBank, the primary lender to agricultural cooperatives, to evaluate optimizing behavior of 77 Midwestern agricultural marketing and supply cooperatives from 2014 through 2017. The study uses the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the weak axioms of cost minimization and profit maximization to identify whether or not a cooperative is following a cost minimization and/or profit maximization objective. Findings: In contrast to previous research, results provide stronger support for profit maximization as the behavioral objective of agricultural cooperatives instead of cost minimization, especially for larger cooperatives. Practical implications: Traditional firm theory for investor-owned firms states that businesses seek to maximize profits. Agricultural cooperatives however, could aim to maximize profits so as to redistribute profits back to user-owners as patronage refunds. Or, they could minimize costs so as to lower cost of products sold and services provided to their user-owners. Given users-control the cooperative, knowing the primary objective of agricultural cooperatives will allow for better design of research and education programming. Originality/value: Given recent changes and consolidation in the agricultural industry among farms and agricultural cooperatives, this study reexamines past work that evaluated the optimizing behavior of agricultural cooperatives. Changes in industry and the necessity to remain competitive from an agribusiness standpoint have resulted in an anticipated shift toward a profit maximizing objective. The value of this study is providing an evaluation framework, using a firm-level comprehensive dataset, that represents the cooperative system. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The exponential increase in anthropogenic activities has led to the accumulation of xenobiotics into the environment, synthetic dyes being one of the culprits. Noteworthy is the fact that the textile industry utilizes enormous volumes of water for dyeing and printing unit operations thereby generating wastewater proportionately. Taking into consideration, implications of toxic textile effluents, a pilot study was planned to screen for naturally attenuated bacterial isolates capable of degrading textile effluents. Requisite effluent samples were collected from Kelki Printers Co-operative Society Limited, Sanganer, Jaipur and bacterial screening was carried out by bioaccumulation of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBRR) (formation of halo around colonies). Of the 19 bacterial isolates obtained, the most promiscuous isolate was biochemically characterized as Enterobacter sp. For biodegradative investigations, it was inoculated in sterilized textile effluent and incubated at 37°C for 7 days under agitating conditions. Pre and post bacterial inoculation (1% v/v), Physico-chemical parameters were analysed following standard procedures. A significant (p<0.05) lowering of pollution indicators was monitored when contrasted with abiotic control. The present study was aimed to explore the role of naturally attenuated and effluent adapted Enterobacter sp. screened from untreated textile effluent based on its colour (RBRR) removal efficacy under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, it was also explored for its biodegradative properties to minimize the level of potential pollution indicators through the microcosm approach. This pilot study based on a three-tier approach encompassing bioprospecting, bio enrichment and bioaugmentation plausibly provided insights for enhanced degradation of real dye wastewaters by unlocking the biochemical pathways of adapted microbes. © 2020 Technoscience Publications.

The paper recommends that the extension linkage with research should be strengthened so as to facilitate the spread of improved cultivars and management practices to farmers. The involvement of more cooperative societies in the multiplication and sales of stems should be encouraged. Integration of information and supply of various inputs is necessary. A group approach to extension delivery should be further promoted and the use of existing and new cultivars should be made popular through an extended or expanded cassava multiplication programme. Effective strategies are needed for stakeholders to share their experiences with those of other countries of the sub region who are participating in the processing of cassava. Cooperation linkages are needed with other important stakeholders like agricultural research, microfinance institutions, quality standards organizations, and equipment fabricators.

The analysis of the population of these acquisitions spans the paths of annual differences in CAMEL ratios. Most acquirers have a somewhat revised capital structure and are often benefiting from economies of scope, as well as economies of scale. Since their acquisitions, the acquiring credit unions have become less risky, measured by simulated CAMEL ratios, and they are lending a larger share of their deposits. There is no apparent financial reason to discourage credit unions from acquiring additional banks and savings institutions. The National Credit Union Administration does not need to be particularly hesitant to allow credit unions to acquire banks and thrifts. Design/methodology/approach: Financial analysis is done via simulated CAMEL ratios. Findings: After acquiring banks, credit unions are less risky and lend a greater share of their deposits. Research limitations/implications: The study analyzes the population of the credit unions that have acquired banks since 2012, but the population consists of 14 banks acquiring 16 credit unions. Practical implications: Credit unions should not be prohibited from further acquisitions of banks and thrifts.

    abstract = {Tasar culture is a traditional practice of local tribes in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha since time immemorial. Traditionally, they used to collect tasar cocoons from forest, keep them for moth emergence, mating and subsequently reared silkworm on forest based Asan or Arjun trees. Gradually, through research intervention economic plantations of host plants, tasar silkworm egg production and rearing methods were introduced. Simultaneously, Tasar Rearers' Cooperative Societies (TRCS), a unique system was developed in Odisha. However, for the production of basic eggs there was dependence on Central Silk Board (CSB). To make the farmers self sufficient in egg production and enhancing the cocoon production, CSB introduced Vanya Cluster Promotion Programme (VCPP) in two areas of Mayurbhanj, viz., Baincha-Jalghati and Thakurmunda-Kendujuani- Mahuldiha Vanya Clusters from 2016-17. A total of 160 farmers comprising of seed (egg) rearers, graineurs (egg producers) and commercial rearers were selected for study. They were trained in different technologies of tasar culture especially in the areas of plantation raising, maintenance, young and late age silkworm rearing, control of pest, predators and diseases of silkworm, egg production. Literacy rate is also very low with 37.5% illiterate and 31.25 were below primary level. However, the technology adoption level by farmers is about 80%. So far as the base line survey is concerned there is significant increase in production as well as productivity of tasar cocoons as well as cocoon quantitative traits. There is 48.23 to 94.55% increase in their income level within last two years. The study further indicates that the farmers of the clusters can be self sufficient in egg production with further increase in their economy. © 2019 MPH.},

Design/methodology/approach: An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used. Findings: The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers’ IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. Practical implications: The findings indicate that agricultural cooperatives can be a transmission route in the efforts to proliferate the adoption and diffusion of IPM technology, and increased IPM adoption tends to improve the economic performance of farm households. Originality/value: Despite the widespread evidence of health and environmental benefits associated with IPM technology, the adoption rate of this technology remains significantly low. This paper provides a first attempt by investigating to what extent and how agricultural cooperative membership affects IPM adoption and how IPM adoption influences farm economic performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: Although credit unions are nonprofit organizations, their objectives depend on the efficient management of their resources and credit risk aligned with the principles of the cooperative doctrine. This paper aims to propose the combined use of credit scoring and profit scoring to increase the effectiveness of the loan-granting process in credit unions. Design/methodology/approach: This sample is composed by the data of personal loans transactions of a Brazilian credit union. Findings: The analysis reveals that the use of statistical methods improves significantly the predictability of default when compared to the use of subjective techniques and the superiority of the random forests model in estimating credit scoring and profit scoring when compared to logit and ordinary least squares method (OLS) regression. The study also illustrates how both analyses can be used jointly for more effective decision-making. Originality/value: Replacing subjective analysis with objective credit analysis using deterministic models will benefit Brazilian credit unions. The credit decision will be based on the input variables and on clear criteria, turning the decision-making process impartial. The joint use of credit scoring and profit scoring allows granting credit for the clients with the highest potential to pay debt obligation and, at the same time, to certify that the transaction profitability meets the goals of the organization: to be sustainable and to provide loans and investment opportunities at attractive rates to members. © 2019, Daniel Abreu Vasconcellos de Paula, Rinaldo Artes, Fabio Ayres and Andrea Maria Accioly Fonseca Minardi.},

    abstract = {This essay offers an account of the tenants’ activist theatres, which developed in Sheffield, UK, in the 1980s, and the role played by myself, and collaborator John Goodchild, in their development. A response by working-class communities to the devastating effects of globalisation, rapid de-industrialisation, and mass unemployment, the theatres were a contribution to local and national campaigns. The essay sets out the political and social context in which the theatres arose, beginning with the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of a Conservative government in 1979. The key themes of what came to be known as Thatcherism, defined by a focus on free market economics, de-regulation, and attacks on trade unions and local government powers, are then detailed. These attacks gave rise to national and local resistance in the forms of strikes and campaigns, which provided the context for the emergence of Manor Campaign Theatre, the first of the tenants’ groups. The main body of the essay offers a narrative of the tenants’ theatres, their processes and organisation, and their role within campaigns around housing, welfare, credit unions, and water poverty. The conclusion connects these struggles with current injustices, sourced in the still-unfolding impacts of Thatcherism. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to provide an easy to follow, practical guide for small traditional banks and credit unions to conduct an enterprise-wide risk assessment of the financial institution’s anti-money laundering compliance program. Design/methodology/approach: Information was collected from relevant documents published by global standard setters in the disciplines of anti-money laundering, financial crime prevention and risk management. The data was integrated with common challenges experienced by small financial institutions to produce an application-based guide that practitioners can readily implement. Findings: Though not a new concept, macro-level financial crises and institutional level financial crimes have influenced the rapid evolution of risk management in financial institutions over the past three decades. Small unsophisticated banks and credit unions are expected to now perform an internal risk assessment. An abundance of information is available on risk assessment, but small institutions remain challenged in finding a turnkey document that is readily actionable to stimulate a less arduous undertaking, especially given the institutions’ limited resources. Research limitations/implications: The setting reflects small deposit-taking institutions with traditional services. It is tailored for easy understanding and practical use by the institutions.

This paper aims to offer an assessment of the record of the British consumer co-operative movement’s efforts to abide by and promote its values and principles during the first 137 years of its existence (1863 to 1990). Design/methodology/approach: The paper is developed using largely qualitative research methods and a variety of sources. These include archival resources and business-historical materials such as committee minutes and correspondence. These materials have been complemented by several semi-structured recorded interviews with senior members of the Co-operative Group. Findings: The authors develop several conclusions. First, where ethical choices were possible and no serious commercial interests were impaired, the co-operative movement could and usually did do its best to adhere to its principles. Second, in several instances, commercial interests did frequently trump ideals. Finally, the organisational structure of the movement made it very difficult to ensure that co-operative principles and values were adhered to. Originality/value: This paper presents a unique case-study that examines the inherent tension between commerce and ethics in the co-operative movement. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The paper analyzes the relationship between remittances and financial development using Kenyan quarterly data from 2006 to 2016. Five different indicators of financial development are used: credit to the private sector as a share of GDP, the number of mobile transactions, the value of these mobile transactions, the number of mobile agents, and the number of bank accounts. The results from using an autoregressive distributed lag demonstrate a strong, positive relationship between remittances and financial development in long-run equations. This suggests that higher levels of remittances provide opportunities for recipients to open bank accounts, enhance their savings, and access financial systems, in addition to exposing the previously unbanked to both new and existing financial products. The results also confirm the potential advantage of embracing modern and advanced technology to facilitate international mobile transfers. Using international remittance transfers through mobile technology reduces costs by eliminating the need for physical branches and personnel to attend to walk-in customers. Aside from offering convenience and safety for remittance actors, this method also dominates traditional remittance business models. Therefore, a policy window exists for the government to leverage on remittances as a tool of financial inclusion and depth, and particularly through the continued expansion of regulatory space to accommodate the wider use of international mobile remittance transfer channels. Moreover, given the strong, positive relationship between remittances and credit to the private sector as indicated by its share of GDP and number of bank accounts, commercial banks and other players in the remittance market may also find it useful to develop customized products for migrants to access their remittances. For example, financial intermediaries can consider providing better deposit interest rates for diaspora deposits compared to deposits made in the local currency. Further, these institutions can allow regular remittance flows to act as collateral for the allocation of credit, among other incentives to tap into the significant potential of money remitted by migrants to Kenya. The study also recommends that the government consider expanding exploitation of diaspora bonds and diaspora savings and credit cooperative societies while drawing lessons from other countries’ previous attempts. © 2019, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Due to the current challenges of climate change, population growth in urban settlements and resource depletion, agri-food researchers have put an increasing emphasis on the sustainability transitions of food systems. In this regard, there has been an increasing interest in the local food supply of cities and their surrounding regions, as local food is considered to be a contributing factor toward more sustainable, resilient and just urban food systems. Based on this background, a roadmapping process was conducted to assess the status quo and to identify measures to enhance the local food supply in the city-region of Graz in Austria. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 47 stakeholders, analysed textual materials and calculated food carrying capacities. The obtained data served as input for a series of three workshops, where measures were derived. Our results suggest that cooperation among agri-food stakeholders should be facilitated by local decision makers in order to promote food from regional sources within the target area. Furthermore, smart technologies can help to scale-up local food supply schemes, and to track down food stocks and flows more efficiently. Besides, food policy councils and open food labs can help to incubate food product innovations and to support partnerships among agri-food stakeholders, including local small-scale farmers. In the future, engagement and empowerment processes with local food stakeholders should be addressed to enable transformational processes. Roadmaps can help to initiate such processes. © 2019 by the authors.},

We analyse their current role by investigating the characteristics of farmers who continue delivering to them and price differentials between cooperatives and investor-oriented firms (IOFs). A probit regression model applied to 917 farmers suggests that cooperative farmers are more disadvantaged than farmers delivering to IOFs in terms of education, farm size and productive technology. Moreover, t-tests applied to data representing 70 per cent of national volume indicate that farmers delivering to cooperatives are between 11 per cent and 29 per cent smaller than those delivering to IOFs, depending on province. A hierarchical multilevel regression model applied to 9,720 transactions among farmers and processors shows that, after controlling for quantity and quality, cooperatives pay lower (3.5%) but more stable prices than IOFs. In a context of rapid structural change, we observe a market in which larger farmers deliver to IOFs and smaller farmers deliver to cooperatives and conclude that, at the expense of paying lower prices, cooperatives may act as buyers of last resort for otherwise disadvantaged farmers. © 2019 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2019 CIRIEC},

But in cooperative decision making and the acquisition of leadership positions women are often marginalized. It has been argued that women-only groups may help to counter this problem. They may increase women's active participation and, thereby, increase the benefits of cooperative membership. This paper reviews relevant literature and studies the effect of gender homogeneity on women's active participation. We apply a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to a sample of ten Indian village-level dairy cooperatives. The results from our comparative case study confirm that gender homogeneity is not a sufficient means to ensure active participation. It is only in combination with other factors, that women-only groups can enhance women's participation.

There were huge differences in advisory flows, methods, and effectiveness according to types of AAS providers and production systems. Rice production received more technology transferred from CAC, CAB and irrigation companies as compared to aquaculture farming. Meanwhile, aquaculture sectors obtained more consultation from input dealers.

Romania needs strong cooperatives and, in order to achieve this, the involvement of not only the authorities and agricultural producers, but also of each inhabitant from the rural area, is required. In the context of food market saturation with import products, it is necessary to revive the Romanian market in order to supply natural and quality products. A total of 1425 agricultural cooperatives were registered in Romania at the end of 2018, out of which 57% did not submit the Balance Sheet. The research performed within the study proposes the usage of fsQCA analysis in order to assess some conditions considered by us essential for the sustainability of the agricultural cooperatives. These conditions are represented by the initial contribution of the members, by the existence of a central collection space, by the employment of a manager, by the knowledge of the members on the development possibilities, and by the involvement of the members within the cooperative's activity. The study highlights the fact that the absence of the conditions presented leads to the absence of a sustainable cooperative. We consider the dissolution of the cooperatives pertinent, which has not developed an activity for more than three years from their establishment and the publication on the MADR website of the National Registry of Cooperatives, which will offer a true image on the prosperity and viability of these types of entities. © 2019 by the authors.},

The canon of equity, especially the vertical form, sometimes referred to as “ability to pay” remains monetary. However, negating conventional horizontal equity, equal taxable incomes often require employment of different economic rationality levels to earn them depending on the profession or sector the tax payer comes from; hence different cognitive energies are required to generate the same taxable income—disapproving the mere “ability to pay” paradigm. From the Gamma Rationality Measure for the credit unions sector that comprises 67% of Kenyan economic livelihoods and using a combination of econometric and Riemann double integral methods, the income consumption rationality function is derived, from which a Cogni-economic Pressure Coefficient is generated for each income level. The coefficient is used to work out a more equitable tax structure from a continuous progressivity tax model, for greater equity, incidentally securing a boost to productivity and economy canons of tax administration—a global lesson, specific for Kenya. © 2020 The Author(s).

    abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the changes in cooperative community and kibbutz industry that did not undergo privatization. Design/methodology/approach: This research was based on the case study method, combined with ethnographic interviews and document analysis. Findings: The findings showed that the industry was highly successful economically, enabling the management to strengthen its authority without sharing information. The decision-making process, thus, became authoritarian, while the community's democratic mechanism was only nominal. This change was also accomplished by cultural transition from cooperative toward more capitalistic values. Management preferred to hire professional workers from the outside without any preference for kibbutz members, causing ethical dilemmas for certain elderly kibbutz members, who felt that the factory had abandoned socialistic ideas. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted only on one kibbutz industry; further research is recommended. Practical implications: Management at cooperative organizations needs to realize that in a capitalistic environment, adaptation can cause the organization to lose its cooperative features. To prevent a cultural shift toward capitalistic values, managers need to be socialized and workers persuaded of the importance of cooperative values. Originality/value: The study is innovative for its focus on loss of cooperative community and managerial style that has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. This research sheds light on organizational conditions that can cause cooperative communities to lose their democratic and socialistic attributes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {During the post-Byzantine period of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in certain areas of Greece, back then, under Ottoman occupation, a particular form of cooperative organization was developed. Rural regions—networks of adjacent communities—having secured a special privileged status of community administration—were organised as a local production system designed to produce specific agricultural or craft products which were then destined for international markets. The present paper aims, first, to bring to light the Greek guild, its internal organization and its geographical impacts; and, second, to investigate the phenomenon of the cooperative community networks. In particular, it presents successful historical examples of cooperative organization, their deeper values and operational rules developed in Eastern Mediterranean during the post-Byzantine period. At the same time, it aims at the study and prominence of the deeper values and motives and main operational rules, firstly on regional micro-level of professional guilds and latterly on a peripheral macro-level of cooperative forms in between in the wider regions of Greek territory. Four historically successful cases of cooperative organization in the Greek territory thrived during the Ottoman occupation, aspects of which offer useful proposals for the founding and operation of today’s cooperative initiatives. The success of these cases is in line with the exploitation of specific political and socio-economic conditions; the parallel growth of an expansive, international commercial network; monopolies’ function; and the invention of innovative operation rules of cooperative organization. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Further, empirical assessment of borrowing pattern of small-scale fishers is conducted by taking the case of ring seiners who constitute an important segment in the local fishery. The main determinants of their borrowing behavior from institutional credit sources are identified using a fractional logit regression approach. The findings point to continuing dominance of the informal financial sector over the institutional credit sector.

Currently, local products from small-scale farms and national branded products with a relatively large scale of production are being registered using GI schemes. Considering the relationships among GI products, their agricultural landscapes, and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), as a GI case study, we examined small GI farms in Odate City, Akita Prefecture, Japan, which produce edible plants called Tonburi. This research explored the complex cause-effect relationship between TEK and landscapes and found that the TEK of Tonburi production influenced biological diversity and vice versa. The TEK and skills of small farmers were confined to the family members of each farmer and were not shared at the community level until GI registration. However, the farmers shared their TEK of sustainable agricultural landscape management through the process of GI registration. Through negotiation between local agricultural cooperatives and farmers, TEK was provided as a form of cultural capital and shared with new producers after GI registration. We concluded that enclosed TEK negatively affects production maintenance and landscape management in the long term. However, the GI registration process contributes to the sharing of TEK as a form of cultural capital among Tonburi farmers. © 2019},

    abstract = {This article analyses new supply chain management (SCM) strategies of the largest retail distribution chains in Europe within the context of differing sustainability concepts and approaches. An analysis is carried out of the strategic plans of such retailers, as well as recent developments in the sector. We begin by identifying the priority actions of retailers and then evaluating, by means of a survey, how small horticultural marketing firms (mainly cooperatives) in southeast Spain respond to the needs of these retailers. Subsequently, an analysis is carried out on these small marketing firm exporters to identify the relative weight which they assign to the variables assessed, while also considering the existing relationships between said weighted variables and business profits. Our results show that retailers tend to establish more simplified supply chains (that is, shorter and more vertical), essentially demonstrating their interpretation of a sustainable supply chain. In contrast, horticultural marketing firms have concentrated more on tactical and operational issues, thereby neglecting environmental, social and logistics management. Thus, their success rate in meeting the sustainability demands of their customers can be considered medium-low, requiring a more proactive attitude. Improved and collaborative relations, and the integration of sustainability concepts between suppliers (marketing firms) and their clients could contribute to successfully meeting sustainability demands. From the point of view of the consumer, close supplier-retail relationships have solved food safety issues, but the implementation of sustainability in other supply chain activities and processes is a pending issue. We propose strategic approximation and collaboration to bridge the gap between the varying sustainability demands in the supplier-retail relationship within perishable supply chains. Although this article specifically addresses fresh vegetable supply chains, the results may be extrapolated to other agri-food chains with a similar structure. © 2019 by the authors.},

This article uses data from 51 interviews with supply chain stakeholders and a survey of 110 smallholder vegetable farmers in Nicaragua to investigate the impact of cooperative-supermarket supply chain relationships on cooperatives, and the role retailers and NGOs play in facilitating these relationships. The study found that in Nicaragua, cooperatives selling to Walmart became unstable, in contrast with the performance of cooperatives selling to local supermarket chain La Colonia. The results show that cooperative performance is impacted by an interaction between differences in the types of farmers reached by the two supermarket chains, in the performance of the NGOs involved in each supply chain, and in the supermarkets’ business practices. The findings suggest that NGOs should pay more attention to buyer sourcing strategies and farmer needs when designing development interventions to link cooperatives of resource-poor farmers to markets, so as not to increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

    abstract = {This article estimates multiproduct and product-specific scale economies, scope economies, and cost efficiency with single and annual cost frontiers using a nonparametric approach. Multiproduct scale and scope economies are found that suggests increasing scale and product diversification can reduce cost for agricultural cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives experience economies of scale indicating that variable returns to scale as opposed to constant returns to scale is the appropriate technology for modeling agricultural cooperatives. Product-specific scale economies for all outputs are close to one indicating that individual outputs are operating close to constant returns to scale. Annual frontier estimates show that cooperatives have become less cost efficient over time, but scale and scope economies remain relatively consistent across years. Further, results show that economic measures obtained from the single frontier are statistically different from those measures calculated from annual frontiers, suggesting that the cost frontier has shifted over time. The trade-off between cost efficiency and multiproduct scale economies indicates that smaller cooperatives can reduce a higher percentage of cost by increasing the scale of operations rather than just becoming cost efficient. Because larger incentives exist for small cooperatives to increase scale, mergers will likely continue until economies of scale are exhausted in the industry. © 2019 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

    abstract = {Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth following the 1994 Genocide. This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural sector, specifically farming intensification and the government’s focus on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda’s economic development has been impressive, many academics have argued that Rwanda’s growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions as well as sustainable economic development. © 2019, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {The potential dark side of government guarantees, introduced to mitigate concerns about financial stability during economic downturns, is that they may create incentives for excessive risk-taking. In a low-interest rate environment, this effect may be even stronger as financial institutions try to “reach for yield”. In this paper, we use the 2008 introduction of unlimited deposit insurance for all credit unions in the province of British Columbia, Canada, to examine the effect of government guarantees on financial institutions’ earnings uncertainty. We find that the policy change resulted in an economically and statistically significant decrease in earnings uncertainty. In addition, although deposits grew following the policy change, lending did not increase and instead capitalization ratios improved. Overall, our results suggest that the provincial government guarantee boosted depositor confidence and increased the flow of funds to the insured financial institutions. We do not find support for the risk-taking hypothesis but instead show that risk management improved following the policy change. Finally, the effect of the policy change was stronger for smaller, more levered credit unions as well as those with fewer members and smaller market share. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper investigates how food supply chains (SCs) introduce sustainability standards (i.e. organic and/or Fair Trade labels). The authors combined the concepts of power and dependence with types of governance mechanisms to analyse for-profit and cooperative organisations. The authors explored nuances of how lead organisations are spreading sustainability standards. Design/methodology/approach: Four cashew nut and honey SCs were investigated as case studies in Brazil, with data gathered through 15 interviews, secondary data and field visits. Data were examined through a content analysis process following a combined deductive and inductive approach. Findings: Sustainability is spread driven by market pressure, mainly through the diffusion of technical information, either by lead organisations enablers or inter-organisational relations. The authors found that the type and structure of organisations impact the source of power (mediated or non-mediated) and level of mutual dependence between buyer and supplier. For instance, suppliers that hold a strategic position use direct governance mechanisms, which, in turn, lessens the power imbalance in regard to the lead organisation. The authors found in the analysis, a close relation between governance mechanisms and the spread of sustainability, which is ultimately based on strong SC relationships. Practical implications: By recognising their role and the contingencies in spreading sustainability standards along the SC, managers of lead organisations can better design their relationships as well as create strategies to increase their supply chain sustainability (SCS) performance. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the underexplored issue of how sustainability standards are spread throughout SCs in Latin America. Also, it shows how different types of SC rely on governance mechanisms that foster SCS. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {In South Africa, cooperatives are the primary institutions through which delivery of governmental agricultural support programmes for rural communities is realised. Although these cooperatives are governed by clear national guidelines that encourage transparency and accountability to their membership, in reality their ability to realise this may be compromised by an imperative to achieve service delivery in an environment of limited governmental support. Drawing on empirical research undertaken at five agricultural cooperatives in the Elliot area of Eastern Cape Province, we examine the extent to which they are able to balance democratic function with effective programme delivery. We show that the limited capacity of local government to reach out to rural areas promotes heavy competition between cooperatives for government programmes, resulting in a highly skewed distribution of benefits determined primarily by how effectively each can ‘reach up’ to local service providers to secure them. This encourages cooperatives to elect powerful actors to represent them because they are perceived to have the greater political ‘connectedness’ required to access these benefits. However, these powerful actors are often less accountable to membership and therefore more likely to disburse benefits to suit their own vested interests. We suggest that, under current conditions, the process of creating effective and legitimate cooperatives must balance strong leadership with a high degree of accountability and transparency to ensure that benefits are disbursed as widely and appropriately as possible to members. Separating executive, judicial and legislative power structures associated with the securing and disbursement of resources to ensure processes are transparent, might be the most practical way of achieving this. Ultimately, if the capacity of the state is strengthened to enable them to ‘reach down’ to cooperatives more effectively, the need to vest leadership in powerful actors and risk compromising accountability and egalitarian service delivery, might be reduced. © 2020 The Author(s).},

    abstract = {In recent years, labor-intensive agricultural products from developing countries have exhibited inferior performance in international trade due to quality and safety incidents, among which pesticide residue is a major issue. Aiming to improve food quality and safety in the context of cooperatives, we introduced three categories of control measures: outcome control, process control and social control. Based on the Pre-Harvest Interval Standard (PHIS), we selected three indices, farmers’ implementation rate of PHIS, absolute distance to PHIS and relative distance to PHIS, to evaluate appropriateness of pesticides use, reduction of pesticide residue and safety improvements of agricultural products. By using random sampling survey data, we empirically analyzed the marginal effects of control measures and their combinations on food quality and safety standards. The empirical results show that implementing process control, namely, unified production standards or supply of unified agricultural inputs, can comprehensively improve farmers’ implementation rate of PHIS, absolute distance and relative distance to PHIS respectively by 34.9%, 3.2 days and 46.0% on average. While the effects of outcome control (safety inspection) and social control (bonus-penalty incentive or training) are restricted to other measures. Therefore, we suggest cooperatives should take farmers’ features, implementation conditions and the effects of control measures into consideration in order to make a sustainable management plan for improving food quality and safety and enhancing competitiveness in international markets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Credit unions are unique as they are member-owned institutions, and their directors are democratically elected by their members – an unusual governance structure that poses challenges for board effectiveness. We find that board remuneration, board expertise and attendance at meetings are associated with increased credit-union performance and are consistent with the goal of maximising member benefits. While the unique features of credit unions limit the presence of external monitoring mechanisms, we provide evidence that these board characteristics are relevant for credit unions. © 2017 AFAANZ},

India’s dairy market was dominated by farmer cooperatives who controlled both milk pricing and, to a large extent, its distribution. While the commodity side of the industry featured strong incumbents and low margins, the value-added milk market was both in high growth mode and rewarded strong players with sizeable margins. Prabhat had started in 1998 serving as an intermediary to players such as Mondelez, Abbott, Perfetti Van Mele, and Britannia but now wants to move into the consumer market.

Using a mixed logit model, results revealed that consumer willingness to pay for organic tomatoes was higher than that for tomatoes labeled as Green or Generally Regarded as Safe (GRS). With regard to brands, consumers prefer brands affiliated with proprietary enterprises over brands held by agricultural cooperatives. The interactions between organic label and brands as well as that between Green label and brands were significantly positive suggesting synergy between these labels and brands. Conversely, the interaction between the GRS label and brands was insignificant.

We find that there are three dominant ideological strands: “sharing economy,” “commons,” and “platform cooperativism,” within a spectrum that ranges from legitimizing neoliberalism and/or reasserting a reformist, more humane capitalism to more radical visions: cooperative society to commons-oriented production, and resisting privatization, through the recapturing of public space as commons. The actors we interviewed can be seen as part of an intermediate class, dependent on platforms for their survival, and who end up involuntary promoters of their own alienation and exploitation, consolidating the deterioration of the very digital labor conditions they seek to transform. © The Author(s) 2018.},

In Spain, there is an ongoing debate about the importance of women in business management. Spain is also a pioneer in terms of enacting specific legislation for the social economy. The sample examined includes 672 agricultural cooperatives. The results show that firms with greater female representation on their boards have higher returns and operational risk and lower levels of debt.

South Korea, which is considered a representative success case of the late capitalist industrialization after the World War II, can be an important example to examine the relevance of this challenging perspective. Korea’s economic success was largely determined by the NACF (National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation) lack of integrity: it was to be a voluntary and autonomous organization of farmers, but became a subordinate partner of the agricultural policy of the military government. The Saemaul (New Country) Movement developed by the government to promote rural innovations actually accelerated the decline of agriculture for it was used to control farmers. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Korean rural society was deeply dependent on the state power. At the same time, the farmers resistance developed as a reaction to the military government policies, and the NACF became the target of the farmers collective resistance movement. Thus, under the Park Chung Hee’s regime, Korean farmers were to participate in the national economy and become a part of the mandatory social-economic movement; however, they never managed to achieve a true class/collective political representation. © 2020, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

    abstract = {Since development agencies often implement interventions through collective-action groups such as farmer cooperatives and self-help groups, there is a need to understand how participation is affected by group-level and leader attributes. This study collected gender-disaggregated, quantitative and qualitative data on sixty-eight self-help groups in Zambia to understand the participation of men and women farmers in different crop-production activities. Results show that participation rates of men and women are the same across all maize production activities except harvesting. The gender composition of members influenced men’s and women’s participation in group activities: when men were fewer in a group, they (men) participated more, while when more women were in a group (above 53 percent), the women participated less. Leader’s education level, knowledge of group agenda, and frequency of meetings also affected participation rates. To design collective action groups that promote gender equity outcomes, gender composition of groups should be considered. HIGHLIGHTS Agricultural collective-action groups assembled by development organizations attempt to bolster women’s participation and leadership within the group and the community. These empowerment groups may inadvertently reproduce traditional gender labor roles, particularly when membership increases women’s workload. Attention to group dynamics demonstrates that minority group members–who are usually men–work harder and overperform due to their increased visibility within the group. Thus, increasing women’s numbers in groups has not aided the goal of increasing their participation. Policymakers should consider the gender composition of the group, labor roles, time commitment of participation, and leader attributes when forming collective-action groups in order to achieve gender-equity outcomes. © 2020 IAFFE.},

Since the operational cycle of these organizations demands a positive net working capital that is usually funded by debt, the authors examine whether this rise in sales was obtained at the cost of the short-term financial sustainability. As a matter of comparison, the authors conduct the same analysis for Brazilian agricultural public traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ the dynamic analysis of working capital method to measure the short-term financial sustainability of these organizations. Findings: The authors find that the expansion of net working capital caused by the growth of the revenues of the sampled cooperatives was mostly funded by short-term debt, which rose by 31% in annualized terms. The authors also document that around 60% of these firms displayed a current capital structure that can be considered risky in terms of indebtedness, and that the majority of firms exhibited a non-sustainable growth in the period, what contrasts with the performance presented by Brazilian agricultural publicly traded companies, since only 16% of the firms from this group have shown a non-sustainable growth. This distinction seems to be explained by the lower capacity of agricultural cooperatives to provide resources from their operations. Originality/value: The authors investigate the short-term financial sustainability of a unique dataset of 65 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives and provide insight for researchers analyzing the dual nature of these firms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Despite the importance of gender equality as a tool for national economic growth gaining prominent attention, women’s access to leadership and decision-making in cooperative societies remains under-researched. Design/methodology/approach: This study hinges on management and gender theories and systematic literature reviews. This study used a descriptive survey research design for primary data derived from a purposive non-random sampling technique that selected seven (7) active cooperative societies in Awka-South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Structured questionnaires were administered to the selected sample of 129 members. The hypotheses were analyzed using the T-test statistical model. Findings: This study revealed that social, legal, economic and cultural constraints affected women’s participation in cooperative societies in Awka, Anambra State. Also, that the African-based culture and family traditions, patriarchal societal system, household responsibilities and homemaker roles, religious associations, certain strict cooperative entry requirements, limitation on women’s access to resources and low paid wages and non-participatory training activities constrained the women. Therefore, the authors recommended that cooperatives should institute measures to encourage an increase in women members’ participation at the committee level and build their capacity own economic resources. Originality/value: This paper focuses on barriers that inhibit women’s participation in cooperative societies with a particular focus on their opportunities and outcomes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study examined the effect of cooperative financial intervention on the growth of catfish aquaculture value chain in Nigeria. Primary data collected, with well-structured questionnaire from 120 participants in aquaculture value chain, were analyzed with descriptive statistical tools, cost and return function and 4-point likert-type scale. The result shows that 32.3% and 27.3% of processors and input suppliers accessed N320,000 and N270,000, respectively. Only 18.2% of producers accessed N180,000. The result indicates that there are more catfish producers than any other operators in the value chain. There is interdependence between catfish producers and input suppliers, processors and marketers in the value chain. Furthermore, catfish processors and inputs suppliers accessed more cooperative loan because their activities were capital intensive. The relatively high amount of cooperative fund accessed by these groups translated high growth rate of 55% and 53%, respectively. The major constraints to the growth of catfish value chain were inadequate credit access and high expenditure on inputs. Operators in the catfish aquaculture value chain should be encouraged to attend workshops on management techniques to improve the efficiency of their businesses. © 2019 Theophilus Miebi Gbigbi et al.},

    abstract = {Shifts in global agriculture have led more women into formal roles in the coffee industry as small-holder producers and cooperative members. Inclusion of women in these institutions, however, does not guarantee a change in historical power relations, or the benefits that might flow from this. A transformative change in gender relations not only requires changes in women' s attitudes and capacities and in the relationships between men and women, but also progress at the institutional and structural levels, a topic which has been infrequently studied. To address this gap, this paper explores institutional perspectives of stakeholders in the supply chain of a fair-trade organic coffee federation located in the western highlands of Guatemala. Major themes emerged from the interviews regarding women' s inclusion in the industry, gender sensitization, women' s empowerment, and supply chain support. The study finds that empowering women as productive cooperative members requires not only technical assistance and support, but also creation of an inclusive social and political environment that supports expanded choices for women and men. The paper expands our understanding of the historical context and current institutional dynamics that are fueling gender transformative change in the coffee industry. The conclusions find that this type of approach may lead to more than just superficial gender integration, and has the potential to result in the genuine integration of women into previously male-dominated organizations and the eventual percolation of society-wide shifts in gender norms, moving towards a more equitable society. © 2020.

    abstract = {Agricultural cooperatives have been extremely successful at producing and bringing food to billions of consumers around the world. Arguably, such success is caused by their superb ability to constantly adapt to the changing needs of their members and consumers. They do this by slightly modifying (tinkering) or completely altering (reinventing) their organizational design. This issue has not been studied in the context of agricultural cooperatives in former Soviet countries. Given the rising importance of agricultural cooperatives in such countries, however, understanding how cooperative adapt to the evolving preferences of their members and customers becomes of utter importance for both cooperative practitioners and policy makers. The current paper addresses the abovementioned knowledge gap. In particular, it identifies the ownership and governance models adopted by Estonian agricultural cooperatives, and provide key insights into how these organizations adapt to the changing needs of their members, consumers, and their external environment. Estonian agricultural cooperatives exhibit little experimentation with non-traditional ownership and governance models. This is due to the lack of technical expertise in the country, the relatively small size of the country's agricultural cooperatives, and their predominantly defensive strategies. Similarly to other European countries, tinkering is of outmost importance for Estonian agricultural cooperatives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Economic bargaining models contend that women’s paid work reduces violence experienced due to increased bargaining power, while male backlash models argue that violence is likely to increase as the traditional male breadwinner role is threatened. The empirical linkages between women working for pay and experiencing men’s violence are also mixed. This study examines the association between women’s paid work participation and their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) and non-partner violence (NPV). It uses multivariate probit regressions to analyze survey data from 937 randomly selected women members of cooperative societies spanning the seven districts of Nepal. The paper hypothesizes that in a traditional setting like Nepal, working women are more likely to experience increased violence as they transgress traditional gender roles. Results suggest that employed women experience both IPV and NPV. Investments in longitudinal studies are needed to understand the point at which economic empowerment yields reversals in violence experienced. HIGHLIGHTS Women’s work statuses influence their experiences of different forms of men’s violence in Nepal. Women’s paid work participation is not necessarily protective against violence by increasing their bargaining power. Women’s employment may increase exposure to violence because of underlying gender hierarchies. Longitudinal research is needed to understand when economic empowerment may avert violence. © 2020 IAFFE.},

    abstract = {This study attempted to investigate the determinants of small-scale farmers’ participation decision and intensity of participation in the fruits (apple and mango) value chains in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. Using a multi-stage sampling procedure, 384 growers were selected at random to participate in the survey. A structured household survey was the main tool for data collection. Descriptive statistical methods and the double-hurdle model were employed in the analysis. Our study finds that the probability of a household being participating in the apple value chain increases with household head education level, experience, extension contacts, and membership in local cooperatives, while decreases with household size and incidence of disease and insect pests. Results further showed that mango plot size and membership in local cooperatives increase the probability of participation decisions in the mango value chain. Moreover, households’ intensity of participation in the apple value chain increases with education level and extension contacts, whereas age squared and distance to the nearest market decrease their intensity of participation in the mango value chain. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at improving rural infrastructure (roads and markets), price information systems, human capital, and promotion of farmers’ cooperatives, as well as access to disease and insect pest control mechanisms, could improve the participation of farmers in the fruits value chain. © 2020 The Author(s).

The Bonusz Agro producer group was established in 2015, and its legal form is cooperative. They use cooperative principles such as the democratic decision-making process 'one member-one vote' principle for both significant and insignificant decisions, unlike some other cooperatives. The management of the cooperative is considering investing in a new industrial site. This new site will be for cleaning/drying the produce, and storing it in a new storage facility, among other things. The company currently lacks sufficient financial resources to make this investment possible. One of the obstacles to obtaining the necessary finances is the lack of collateral the organization has control over. This case study examines the investment decision. The main focus is on how the organization can enlist the contribution of all members. The most delicate part of the decision-making dilemma is that all members would have to offer some of their own assets as collateral. These assets would be part of their agricultural land, which is necessary to obtain the required external financial resources from banks. © 2020 Mizik.},

    abstract = {Knowledge generated using data mining techniques is of great interest for organizations, as it facilitates tactical and strategic decision making, generating a competitive advantage. In the special case of credit granting organizations, it is important to clearly define rejection/approval criteria. In this direction, classification rules are an appropriate tool, provided that the rule set has low cardinality and that the antecedent of the rules has few conditions. This paper analyzes different solutions based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques, which are able to construct a set of classification rules with the aforementioned characteristics using information from the borrower and the macroeconomic environment at the time of granting the loan. In addition, to facilitate the understanding of the model, fuzzy logic is incorporated into the construction of the antecedent. To reduce the search time, the particle swarm is initialized by a competitive neural network. Different variants of PSO are applied to three databases of financial institutions in Ecuador. The first institution specializes in massive credit placement. The second institution specializes in consumer credit and business credit lines. Finally, the third institution is a savings and credit cooperative. According to our results, the incorporation of fuzzy logic generates rule sets with greater precision. © 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, testing how individuals recognize group membership, and the decision to cooperate or attack during social interactions is critical to understanding the evolution of sociality. We explore decision-making in the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina, a highly territorial and also cooperative species. Here, we report a previously undescribed rescue behavior for weaver ants, and determine the role of distance and group membership in residents’ decisions to either rescue or attack conspecifics in distress. First, we tested if residents preferentially rescued nestmates and attacked non-nestmates. Our results show that rescue was more likely for nestmates; however, surprisingly, conspecifics from neighboring colonies were rescued in 43% of the distress trials. Furthermore, attacks became more frequent as distance between colonies increased showing a dear enemy effect, which may be explained by familiarity, odor recognition, and/or relatedness. Our work exploring the factors that influence the decision to rescue or attack provides novel evidence to understand the underlying selective pressures that shape decisions of cooperation or conflict in highly cooperative societies. © 2018, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).},

The paper also documents that the proportion of exposed firms doubles during periods in which the local central bank intervenes more in the currency regime, lending support to the moral hazard hypothesis: when the exchange rate is less flexible, local companies tend to adopt unhedged positions in response to implicit government guarantees. Finally, firms with more debt, better asset management, lower inventory levels, and higher product differentiation tend to be less exposed to currency swings [EconLit Citations: F31, G15, G23]. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

    abstract = {The modernisation of agriculture has been, and continues to be, the cause of an increasing disconnection between farming, nature, and society. This has given rise to a series of social, economic, and ecological crises in the food chain. Some farmers are responding to this by adjusting their land-use and farming practices so as to make their farms more sustainable. But such changes need to be aligned with the specificities of the local bio-physical environment and the logic of the political economic environment. This article highlights how cooperative approaches allow public and private regulatory systems to support ecological transitions. Through a theoretical lens on place-based and restorative farming practices it analyses and interprets three complementary cooperative approaches as possible starting points for the transition towards a more sustainable agri-food system. The case studies show how farmers cooperatives can be either linked to the environment and to public policies (and thus extrinsic product quality), or to the market (and intrinsic product quality), or a combination of both. These links provide competitive advantages to farmers, and enable them to increase income from farming. We then discuss the effectiveness of these forms of self-governance, and how cooperative approaches, if well organised and implemented and appropriately embedded, can empower farmers to further change and adapt their farming practices so as to restore and improve their endogenous resource base. The analysis shows that while they are place-specific they are far from locally/regionally-bounded and that their success (or failure) critically depends on their alignment with national, supra-national and global actants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Also effect of weather conditions was evaluated. The polyfactorial trial was realized in experimental years 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 in terms of agricultural cooperative in Mojmírovce. The experiment was based on three variants of fertilization treatments by the block method in three replications. The size of each block was created by plots with size 600 m2. The first level of treatment 10 was non-fertilized control. The second level of treatment 2U was fertilized by nitrogen in dose 240 kg.ha-1. The third level of treatment 3P was fertilized by the same dose of nitrogen 240 kg.ha-1 and by phosphorus in dose 88 kg.ha-1. The highest average yield 3.9 t.ha-1 was achieved at treatment 3P, where phosphorus was applied. It means statistically significant yield increase by 30% compared to treatment 2U, where no phosphorus was not applied. There was statistically non-significant difference in oil content, in the range of treatments. The content of oleic acid fluctuated from 63.3% to 65.9% and the highest was reached at unfertilized control treatments in both experimental years. The linoleic acid content ranged from 20.3% to 21.2% and content of linolenic acid varied between 6.9% and 8.9%. Application of nitrogen and nitrogen + phosphorus high statistically significant decreased oleic acid content in both experimental years. Opposite effect was observed, where content of linoleic and linolenic acid was high statistically significant increased after nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus fertilization. Effect of unequal weather conditions and treatments of nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus nutrition can influence the percentage ratio of higher fatty acids composition. © 2020 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno.

    abstract = {Land consolidation (LC) is implemented as a public project that contributes to the improvement of agricultural productivity, and its effect is evaluated mainly by labour productivity and land productivity. However, to maintain both agricultural production and the social community, understanding the impact on non-farmers in the community as one of the aspects of LC is extremely important. In this study, we surveyed rural areas about eight years after the LC was implemented by posted questionnaire and analysed the difference between farmers' and non-farmers' perceptions of the multifaceted evaluation items on the policy effect. The evaluation points for the LC include the following: [1] Impact on farming and farmland preservation, [2] Impact on community activation, and [3] Impact on collaboration between farmers and non-farmers. Results can be summarized as follows: First, it was confirmed that there is a trend for non-farmers' attachment to the area to be reduced because of LC. Second, non-farmers evaluations that LC attracts young farmers were also low. However, this opinion was much more noticeable in non-farmers who had quit agriculture recently than in the generation that had left agriculture because of LC. In other words, LC is a useful policy for improving agricultural conditions and agricultural structure. However, in some cases, the connections between farmers and non-farmers is weakened. Thus, cooperative activities to actively prevent this weakening are important. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.},

    abstract = {Purpose: A pilot composting project was initiated as part of a 200 tons/day solid waste recycling plant with active involvement of several local stakeholders. The project aimed at introducing compost production and use in the village of Al Jalameh, Palestine. This paper describes the successes and lessons from the pilot project. Methods: Based on the data collected on the population, waste production and economic activities, the best production methodology and composting units were designed and piloted. The compost was produced from animal manure, farm waste and organic fraction of domestic solid waste. Approaches to increase profit and sustain the initiative was implemented. Results: The facility managed by Al Jalameh Agricultural Cooperative Society, recycles 60% organic fraction of domestic waste reducing the quantity of waste to the landfill. An estimated 1425 m3/year of compost are required for local agriculture while 800 tons/year is produced. With most of their compost coming from Israeli sources, the composting facility is at a competitive advantage. To increase the profit, around 28,125 kg of waste plastic sheets from greenhouses are collected for recycling each year generating a stable income of 5625.00 JOD/year. Conclusions: The compost produced in the village is purchased by the local farmers increasing access to compost at competitive price. Farmers are economically encouraged by compost production that could solve the organic waste management issue and at the same time guarantee a sort of “self-production” of fertiliser useful for local agriculture. This initiative could be extended to other villages in Jenin and other developing countries where agriculture is their major occupation. © 2019, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Even though the investment sector generally governs economic growth in developed countries. Indonesia's economic growth so far has been dominated by the consumption sector. On the other hand, one of the significant contributors to the investment sector is the entrepreneurs’ role in any country. Therefore, the challenge for Indonesia is to make the entrepreneurs reach substantial contributions. This study investigates on three variables; namely entrepreneurial orientation, cooperatives, and entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial orientation is the exogeneous variable, cooperative is the mediator variable and, the entrepreneur is the endogenous variable. These three variables are formed into three sub-models and one complete model. Each sub-model is to find out whether the dimensions contribute to each variable, and the entire model is to find out a significant relationship among the variables. The method used is the structural equation model (SEM), with computer software LISREL. This research will produce a breakthrough in how cooperative can mediate from entrepreneurial orientation to entrepreneurs. Besides, the study will deliver how cooperative stakeholders to get some understanding of entrepreneurial orientation so that cooperatives as an institution can persuade members of organizations to become entrepreneurs to be ready to contribute to economic growth. Moreover, the results provide the science of sustainable management on how to apply creativity and innovation to the cooperative organization. © 2020 by the authors.},

Findings indicate that Canada and Cuba’s agricultural co-operatives face the challenges of membership renewal and economic presence in their national economies. The paper argues that components of each agricultural co-operative system at the farm and tertiary levels could be adapted to the other nation’s agricultural co-operatives in order to strengthen community control of local food systems. The paper further argues that a new approach to agricultural co-operatives must incorporate the state itself in any potential reform agenda in both countries.

    abstract = {In the Nordic countries, agricultural co-operatives were important when family farmers organised to get access to the quickly developing markets during industrialisation in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These co-operatives were organised both as credit, insurance, processing and marketing co-operatives. Spreading at first from Denmark to the rest of Northern Europe and later reaching the new settler continent in North America, farmers’ co-operatives soon became a key element in private farming in market economies. As many co-operatives became large companies in the capitalist economies, they either became ordinary share companies, or retained their farmer-owned co-operative status like in Norway. After Marxist-inspired revolutions in Russia, China, Eastern Europe and later Vietnam and Cuba, state organised and government-controlled co-operatives were set up in socialist countries. Many of the old forms of agricultural co-operatives in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe collapsed when the centrally planned economies were abolished in the early 1990s. However, new forms of food production and distribution cooperation have emerged both in the capitalist and former socialist countries. These co-operatives were organised both among producers and consumers in order to meet the common needs of direct access to foods. While it is assumed that family farming and food markets will have to play a more important role in the Cuban food economy in the future, it will be interesting to see if small farmers in collaboration with wholesale co-operatives will be allowed to develop short and sustainable supply food chains, which could be competitive against state socialist and multinational capitalist agriculture. Cuban agricultural policy must be able to evolve along two strategies: a volume agriculture that delivers high-quality, durable basic foods to the predominantly urban population, but also delivers local traditional food with craftsmanship to tourists and a growing middle class. Both strategies will be necessary in order to address a historic challenge of the Cuban socio-economic development: to produce sufficient food and make it available to consumers at affordable prices, thus also saving scarce currency today spent on food imports. © 2020.

    abstract = {Director selection is linked with contradictory board roles which call for the need of multiple approaches. In cooperatives, which are member- and user-driven rather than profit-driven, this approach is essential. The aim of this study is to analyze director selection in agricultural cooperatives by using a qualitative approach and hence, contribute to theory development. The results indicate that the director selection process and roles contain several paradox issues in two dimensions: administrative culture as well as the roles and authority of important actors. The paper contributes to the understanding of (1) mechanisms and relationships inherent in the process of director selection in agricultural cooperatives (2) the administrative culture as well as the roles and authority of the actors in the process and (3) paradoxes which help us to understand tensions in director selection under the requirement of fulfilling both the performance task and the conformance task. The paper discusses the results against the current board theories and suggests a new paradox dimension. It is suggested that director selection should be studied further from the perspectives of (1) implications of the use of authority and (2) the implications of the administrative culture. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

    abstract = {Efforts to slow down and eventually reverse the trend of climate change will take time, and in some cases, the negative impacts of climate change will be felt long before long-term solutions to this problem can bear fruit. Adaptation and mitigation strategies constitute the front line of attack for rural households in developing countries that rely on agricultural production and natural resource use as their main source of income and growth, and whose livelihoods are threatened by climate change. This study models the determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices by coffee producers in the department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua. Using primary survey data, we analyze the extent to which cooperative membership impacts adoption of ten different practices. We find that coffee farmers who belong to cooperatives have adopted sustainable practices at higher rates than non-members, and that the odds of adoption are higher for members than for non-members. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structural differences between the ten practices, and from this analysis three factors emerged and were modeled. We find that cooperative membership is a significant determinant of practices that promote water conservation, yet not significant for practices that promote soil and plant health, nor for practices related to field management. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors, and development and extension practitioners in the coffee sector, as they can better inform and guide policies toward more efficient and effective paths of long-term climate change adaptation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse performance (on efficiency) of agricultural cooperatives in Mpumalanga province, South Africa, using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The empirical investigation is motivated by the dearth of empirical literature on agricultural cooperatives’ performance measurement and its correlates. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed DEA and applied the input minimisation constraint. The authors used the data from 19 agricultural cooperatives which had complied with reporting on their annual financial statements (AFS) in the financial year 2014/2015. The input variables were total assets and total expenses, and the output variables were revenue and profit. Findings: The average technical efficiency was found to be 72 per cent efficient indicating the presence of 28 per cent resource wastages. Of the 19 decision-making units, only 5 (26 per cent) were 100 per cent efficient. It should be noted that the 26 per cent that were technically efficient were also operating at constant returns to scale (optimal resource allocation). Research limitations/implications: Data limitation was with regard to 19 cooperatives, which means that if more agricultural cooperatives could be analysed, the results will be different. Practical implications: There are more than 60 agricultural cooperatives in the province, and yet only 19 could report on their AFS. This is an indication that there is a gap in governance, and policy makers and government need to revisit support, over and above funding, and issues of governance have to be strengthened. Social implications: Agricultural cooperatives are created as vehicles that can stimulate the economy and contribute towards job creation. If the cooperatives do not perform or are not sustainable, the socio-economic conditions of the communities in which they operate will never realise the economic gains. Originality/value: The study was necessitated by the continued focus on government based on the cooperatives, as there is a dearth of empirical literature separating managers’ reports and empirically proven studies/results. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The article explores the histories of oil palm in Nicaragua during the 20th century within a drastically changing Political Economy. In Nicaragua, palm oil cultivation dates back to the 1950s, when the United Fruit Company started to plant oil palm on the Atlantic Coast. In the 1980s, due to the agrarian reform of the Sandinista revolution, political conditions and economic strategies changed completely. In this era, a socialist government started to create agricultural cooperatives for oil palm. After the defeat of the revolution, during the neoliberal era of the 1990s, palm oil cultivation expanded in different surges. This expansion was tied to funding from international organizations, especially during the conjuncture of the bioenergy framework, which implied a new narrative of sustainability from the global level. The extent of the territory on which oil palm is cultivated more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2010, and again more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, although the Sandinista government was back in power and not particularly supportive of oil palm. The article argues that although the drivers, the main actors, their specific arguments, funding sources, and policies promoting oil palm have varied over time, the narrative of 'already degraded land' has consistently been used. Social contestations from below point not only to environmental and social consequences, but to the funding schemes and narratives of international institutions sponsoring and promoting oil palm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Data obtained through a survey of 150 cocoa farmers were analyzed through three main statistical methods: (1) an exploratory factor analysis with a principal component analysis method; (2) cluster analysis; and (3) an independent samples t-test. The results confirm that farmer satisfaction is explained by a complex set of cognitive and psycho-social elements and pro-social emotions. Finally, the results indicate that some socio-economic features such as farm size or household size are associated with the varying existing levels of farmer satisfaction. © 2020 Higuchi et al.},

This work is based on a multicase study on 10 agricultural cooperatives in the state, whose managers were interviewed in a semi-structured way in 2016. The results showed that the main problems encountered in the management of these organizations are as follows. a) Cooperatives compete with other companies in the sector, and they must be competitive while being faithful to the cooperative principles. b) The team responsible for the cooperatives’ management finds it difficult to compete in oligopolized markets. c) Cooperative members’ participation in management is low. d) Cooperatives’ associates and members exhibit opportunistic behaviors.

The impacts of horticulture on agricultural outcomes are also analyzed. The results indicate that membership of commercial vegetable cooperatives has so far had no effect on agricultural incomes or the value or amounts of agricultural inputs. However, results indicate that membership has affected technology choice, access to credit services and information transmission through technological training. Additionally, there is evidence that horticulture, as a component of overall agricultural diversification, can augment farm income. The results suggest that much of the benefit of cooperative membership stems from the cooperative's provision of services, which might not be easily inferred from measures of member incomes. © 2019 The Authors.

The objective of this article is to look into the possibility of using some methodology for measuring farm sustainable innovativeness and thus ranking farms based on this criterion. The article demonstrates the need for a multi-criteria method of innovativeness measurement and substantiates the complex proportional assessment method (COPRAS) as the most appropriate choice for addressing this challenge. The article presents the model of use of the proposed method and describes its practical application.

The Brazilian agribusiness sector presented an accumulated growth rate of 4.28% in the period from January to October 2016, evidencing its importance in resumption of the Brazilian economic growth. The research population is composed by 64 farming cooperatives from Paraná. The research is aligned to the Abdel-Kader and Luther (2008) and Guerreiro et al. (2011) studies, whose questionnaires were adapted for this study. To the potential respondents were sent a link and returned 38 valid questionnaires. The data collected were treated using descriptive statistics - means, variance and standard deviation. In the surveyed sample 58.6% of the farming cooperatives employ up to 100 employees. The remaining respondents, 13.5% up to 500, 5.4% up to 1000 and 21.6% up to 3000 employees. The findings of this study are in line with those of some previous studies regarding the adoption and use of more traditional accounting practices. The majority of the farming cooperatives studied in Paraná use to a higher degree the managerial accounting practices listed in the evolutionary stages 1 and 2 of IFAC (1998), but also using some practices of stages 3 and 4. In relation to the most contemporary tools such as target costing, Economic Value Added (EVA) and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) findings suggest low level of adoption and utilization. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that there is still a paradox between the set of tools available in the literature and those practiced by the organizations. © 2019, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the performance of the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires with 1–5 Likert scale. The sample consisted of the representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in Central Java Province, representative of the management of 12 dairy cooperatives located in West Java Province and some farmers who are members of those dairy cooperatives. This study uses balanced supply chain management scorecard for measuring the performance of dairy supply chain, importance-performance analysis (IPA) for identifying the indicators that are most in need of improvement, and strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) analysis for formulating strategic planning. Findings: The results of balanced supply chain management scorecard combined with IPA analysis showed that the performance relationship between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in West Java Province is slightly better than that in Central Java Province. It can be seen from the average value of the score of indicator, the category of each indicator and the category of the performance index of each relationship. The major weakness of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province lies in the different perspective (no perspective is dominant), whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer. On the other hand, the major strength of the relationship in Central Java Province is dominated by the perspective of the customer, whereas that in West Java Province is dominated by the perspective of learning and growth. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of the dairy cooperatives as the sample and the type of scale used to measure the performance of the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and individual milk processors. So, the future research may replicate this study by surveying all the dairy cooperatives in Central Java and West Java Provinces. It may also enhance the measurement of the performance of the relationships by using a direct measure of each indicator in each perspective, rather than recording the management of dairy cooperative perceptions. Practical implications: This research provides essential insights for the management of dairy cooperative in the context of strategic planning development. The research reveals that there is a different strategic planning for improving the performance of the relationship between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors in each province. It depends on the major weakness and strength of the relationships, and also, opportunity and threat faced by the dairy industry. One important thing, the management of dairy cooperative in both provinces should have strategic planning related to the use of machine milking by farmers to improve the milk quality. Social implications: The research revealed that strategic planning could be built after analyzing the internal and external conditions carefully. It may encourage more dairy cooperatives to measure and analyze the internal and external conditions at the bottom of strategic planning of their business. Originality/value: Although this research only used the balanced supply chain management scorecard and IPA analysis for measuring the performance, and SWOT analysis in formulating the strategic planning for improving the current performance, it will make a difference. First, instead of measuring the performance of dairy cooperatives, this research measured the performance of the relationships between dairy farmers, cooperatives and industrial milk processors. This way, the dairy cooperatives were only sources of data collection. Second, the investigation was quite complicated since the objects of the research were represented by the relationships between farmers, dairy cooperatives and industrial milk processors in Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Each MFI was labelled as either a bank, cooperative and credit union, nonbanking financial institution or non-governmental organization, and then the analysis was performed on each separate group. The results suggest that, on average, banks are the most efficient MFIs; while NGOs are, on average, the least efficient MFIs. On average, all 4 groups are more pure technically efficient than scale efficient. Banks, nongovernmental organizations, nonbanking financial institutions, cooperatives and credit unions all seem to have problems with scale efficiency. Many MFIs seem to be operating on the increasing returns to scale frontier and are in a more favourable position for expansion. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {This paper is a summary of the findings of research work conducted in two case studies in the Rift Valley, Kenya. This study used the Neo-Institutional theory to interrogate how the rules and regulations (institutions involved) of the agrarian reform process in Kenya are constantly changing and helping to shape the livelihoods of social actors around Mau Forest. The first case study-Ndungulu, is a settlement scheme where the Ogiek ethnic community were resettled between 1995 and 1997 after the land clashes of 1992. The second case study is the Kamuyu cooperative farm, a post-colonial settlement scheme owned by a cooperative society that was founded in 1965 by members from the Kikuyu ethnic group. This study employed qualitative data collection methods intermittently between 2012 and 2017 for a total of two years. A total of 60 interviews were conducted for this research. Thirteen (13) of these were key informant interviews with experts on land. The qualitative interviews were complemented by participant observations and nine focus group discussions. The qualitative data from the interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed, coded and analyzed thematically. Observations documented as field notes were also analyzed to complement the study findings. In this paper, the challenges, bargaining position and power play between social actors and government institutions implicated in the agrarian reform process in Kenya has been brought to the forefront. For instance, due to the structural issues that date back to the colonial period, the Ogiek have found innovative ways to maintain their daily existence (e.g., maintaining traditional methods of apiculture in Mau Forest). However, constraints in accessing forest land has resulted in them taking desperate measures, namely; selling off land to the Kalenjin in what is called "distress land sales". On the contrary, the neighboring Kikuyu have maintained their land ownership status despite recurrent ethnic clashes that have occurred during general election years. © 2018 by the authors.},

However, they also face number of challenges which may affect their performance. Most of the previous studies in the area of SACCOS did not concentrate on their performance. The aim of this study therefore was to assess performance of SACCOS in Maseru District, Lesotho. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design where data were collected at one point in time. A sample size of 369 respondents was computed by the use of formula by Yamane (1967). Respondents in the sample were selected by using simple random sampling technique. However, respondents from individual SACCOS were proportional to the total number of members in particular SACCOS. This was done in order to make the sample representative of all SACCOS in the study area. Analyses of data were done by using different techniques which include: mathematical equations (i to vii); different financial ratios; tables; graphs; bar charts and other types of descriptive statistics like mode and percentages. It was found that socio economic characteristics of members were supportive to financial performance of the SACCOS. Furthermore, SACCOS in the study area achieved high performance in terms of ratios of members' capital; loan delinquency; volumes of savings in the SACCOS; and growth of total assets. On the other hand, the SACCOS realised poor financial performance in terms of ratio of fixed assets to total assets; and share capital owned by members. © 2019, International Journal of Financial Research.},

These entities played a key role in the institutional architecture of the apartheid regime, ensuring the domination of white commercial farmers over the sector. Within the framework of the deregulation of the economy and the agricultural sector, such entities faced transformations of modern capitalism, especially the growing power of financial actors and markets. Although white commercial farmers still largely retain these inherited structures, these companies are presently being targeted more and more by private takeovers and/or private equity deals. Based on two specific empirical examples of private equity deals affecting South African grain cooperatives, this paper describes this financialization process in practice, in particular by analysing the interaction between financial and agricultural actors and the alliances on the ground that determine its “success.” In doing so, it details the different trajectories of these (former) cooperatives, highlighting the resilience, mutation, and extinction of commercial agriculture in South Africa. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

On the basis of a survey of all 191 district council members and council chairpersons of a large Swedish agricultural co-operative, it is found that the elected representatives rank low in terms of co-operative conviction and social concerns. They involve themselves mainly in order to get personal benefits; they want to gain access to information, mature personally and obtain inputs to develop their farm enterprises.

Strategic management could be a relevant approach to help cooperative members to improve the global performance and the social responsibility of their cooperatives. To formalize and to manage their strategy, we propose as an accompaniment a method entitled PerfCuma. The theoretical framework is based on the concept of systemic approach to change. The method is organized in four steps: i) an in-depth stakeholder's analysis of the cooperative situation (including sustainability) and the cooperative goals; ii) formalizing the strategy by defining strategic lines. We use the cognitive map approach to model the complexity to understand the strong drivers of the strategy; iii) drawing up the balanced scorecard and an action plan to manage the strategy; iv) monitoring the implementation of the strategy. A test of the method on five Cooperatives for the Use of Agricultural Equipment (Cuma) has been successful.

To validate the model a set of gasification experiments were performed in a 250 kW quasi-industrial gasifier. The cold gas efficiency of the th gasifier and tar production were evaluated to assess the energy potential of olive pomace while determining its most suitable end-use applications. A techno-economic analysis addressing the comparison of two different commercially manufactured gasifying unit sizes (100 kW and 1000 kW) and a Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis were employed to assess both the feasibility of each application size and also foresee the main investment risks in conducting olive pomace gasification in small rural facilities. Olive pomace gasification showed to be more suitable for personal household purposes. The low cold gas efficiency (around 20%) makes this producer gas more appropriate for small cogeneration facilities applications. The use of olive pomace residues in gasification showed viable economic performance in small cogeneration solutions at a scale of 1000 kW for agriculture waste-to-energy recovery in olive oil agriculture cooperatives, while 100 kW showed to be unable to reach an economically sustainable scenario. Final remarks point out that despite the feasibility of the venture at a scale of 1000 kW special concerns must be considered regarding the study attractiveness to potential investors. © 2019 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.},

However, AF seems to have adoption problems due to external market forces, lack of skills, financial resources and know-how ending in low flexibility and discontinuity of farmers in practicing AF. The objective of this study is to identify social, institutional, and economic factors that influence the adoption of AF on the household and community level, taking the region Alta Verapaz in Guatemala as a case study. Alta Verapaz is amongst the poorest regions in the country but also a tropical biodiversity hotspot where current agricultural practices are threatening forest environments and social development objectives. Our study explores how capital accessibility and institutional incentives are related to farmer’s livelihood sustainability and AF compositions. The methodology is composed by semi-structured interviews with nineteen farmers and field observations. The interviews have been analysed based on a qualitative content analysis by using the inductive category development. Based on these outcomes, the study found that human and economical capitals are favoured in communities were institutions are present especially through AF training offers, creation of farmers cooperatives and economic incentives. The role of institutions resulted to be crucial in the promotion of organic AF methods, forest protection and creation of long-term income. The combination of agricultural diversification with institutional incentives is one key livelihood strategy adopted by the farmers in order to achieve a socio-economic and ecological sustainability of their households. The further promotion of community forestry projects, expansion of networks and ongoing agricultural trainings as well as the diversification of agricultural systems could be beneficial for farmers in Alta Verapaz. © Author(s) 2019.},

    abstract = {Community development is seen as a crucial factor to realize sustainable development and vice versa, and for indigenous peoples in particular due to their associations with nature and natural resources. However, historical exploitation of indigenous peoples has resulted in their underachievement worldwide. The popularization of the concept of sustainable development followed a series of international treaties and conventions that shed light on indigenous peoples' revival. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's notion of the power-knowledge relationship, this article uses a case study of an indigenous tribe, the Smangus in Taiwan, to demonstrate how a politically, socially and economically disadvantaged community incorporates their traditional norms and customs into the notion of sustainable development and reinterprets it to adapt the community's conditions. By re-uniting the community and establishing a cooperative organization, the community has revived cohesion in their community. The community's conduct is investigated through the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030, and the article illustrates how it fulfils three Targets and the extent to which they are fulfilled. To conclude, Smangus' case remind us of the importance of achieving sustainable development goals on micro- and local levels, and the value of empowering local communities to pursue their own sustainable development goals according to their circumstances. This article ends with suggestions for future research, and suggests that more studies using such a bottom-up approach to sustainable development would help to accumulate knowledge and experiences to establish a pattern of success to help other disadvantaged communities, draw focus to the need to bridge the policy gaps between the United Nations and local communities, and recall attention to the role of micro- and local communities to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2018 by the authors.},

I surveyed 97 farmers from Atok (fair trade supplier) and 96 farmers from Tublay (non-fair trade supplier). Also, I conducted focus group discussions of 8 to 10 members from each group and in-depth interviews with formal and informal leaders and key-informants (buyer and local government leaders). The t-test revealed that the farmer cooperative that supplies to FT organization has a significantly higher tendency to ask support from non-government organizations (NGO) and financial institutions. Likewise, they have a higher score in collective action and perceived economic performance. Additionally, regression analysis showed that trust in local government unit (LGU), empowerment, and cooperative classification are positive predictors of perceived economic performance while trust in NGO and membership expansion have negative effects on perceived economic performance. © 2018 by De La Salle University.},

    abstract = {Farmer cooperatives in China have been developing a hybrid form of governance with features that are seldom observed in other countries. The Beizhijiang vegetable cooperative (hereafter BZJ cooperative), which was founded in 2009, is a case in point. The chairperson of the BZJ cooperative has dominant control over the decision-making and income rights of the cooperative and is also president of the Pangu corporation, a downstream buyer of BZJ products. The purpose of this case study is to allow students to understand the special form of the cooperative in a Chinese context and to compare it to the International Cooperative Association principles regarding cooperatives.

This study aims to conduct an in-depth investigation of the banking sector in response to the challenges brought by Fintech startups. Based on the service innovation theory, we propose a novel hybrid multiple criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to evaluate service innovation strategies for improving the sustainability of China's banking industry during the Fintech revolution. A six-dimensional model comprising 20 sub-criteria is constructed and both the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique and DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) are used to explore interrelationships among the indices and their related weights. Finally, the modified VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method is employed to evaluate performance gaps in the four major types of commercial banks in China-state-owned, joint-stock, city commercial banks, and other credit cooperatives-in the field of service innovation. The improvement priorities, ranked from highest to lowest, are new business partners, new service concepts, organizational innovation, technological innovation, new customer interactions, and new revenue models. These results will provide strategies for the sustainable development of China's banking industry and the implementation of changes in response to the impact of the Fintech revolution. © 2019 by the authors.},

    abstract = {The financial performance of rubber cooperatives in Trat Province, Thailand was studied. The results revealed that characteristics of rubber cooperatives were divided into primary and secondary businesses. Four rubber cooperatives obtained the highest revenue from gathering rubber products as primary business, accounting for 50 percent of all rubber cooperatives, covering 22.53 million (THB.) per year. Regarding secondary business, two rubber cooperatives generated the highest revenue by supplying and selling fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, and processing rubber products accounting for 4 million (THB) per year. Seven cooperatives (87.5%) had acceptable financial performance ratios. This finding implied that these cooperatives were successful in terms of operation. The ability of rubber cooperatives to meet current obligations and the use of resources were effective. In contrast, only one cooperative investing in rubber processing gained an unacceptable financial performance ratio which was below than 2. The Acid-test (-0.17) demonstrated rubber cooperative dependency upon inventory. Additionally, the inventory turnover ratio was excessively high. There was much invested in rubber processing, machinery, and equipment. Cooperative management should consider financial ratios as an important tool to investigate the performance of rubber cooperatives. © 2018 International Journal of Agricultural Technology.All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Community-based initiatives with a double objective of improving rural livelihoods and conserving forest resources face the challenge of balancing the two objectives without creating trade-offs. Our study investigates the socio-economic performance of a community-based initiative that uses cooperative-driven organic certification of honey producers in Mwingi, Eastern Kenya, to improve livelihoods and acacia woodland management. Data were collected through a household survey of 303 beekeepers from 38 organic certified and 16 non-certified beekeeper groups. More data were collected using key informant interviews, informal conversations, participant observation, participatory rural appraisal, internal document reviews and secondary sources. The survey included questions regarding beekeepers' livelihood activities, organisation involvement, quantity of honey produced and sold, net honey income and welfare perceptions after certification (2015) and before certification (2008), retrospectively. The results showed minimal to no significant impacts of certification on households' incomes, honey quantity or sales prices, as the general development, though positive, followed that of the non-certified households. The lack of impacts stemmed from failure to monitor and technical backstopping of certified beekeepers, a poor cooperative management and mistrust among the members and Mwingi organic cooperative board. The board mainly bought honey from a non-certified middleman thereby undermining the Mwingi organic cooperative's values as well as their own potential niche market. On a positive note, the cooperative's honey market place, receiving customers from afar, has the potential to support the development of a niche organic market outlet. However, this requires reconnection of the cooperative to its members, trust rebuilding and transparent management of the cooperative. The study exemplifies a case of community-based livelihoods-conservation initiative which did not take local community capacity development and more general long-term project sustainability into consideration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {Globalization of agricultural markets put pressures on producer cooperatives to invest in expansion and growth to safeguard their competitiveness. Availability of capital is limited if farmers do not have incentives to increase their capital contribution. Cooperative literature recognizes the residual rights, transferability, and the appreciation potential of the investment as the potential solutions for the problems that may impede cooperative investments. The objective of this study is to understand farmer preferences regarding investment attributes and the potential for attracting investment capital from members and non-members. We employ a choice experiment method to test new cooperative investment instruments. The data consist of a questionnaire conducted with 406 Finnish dairy farmers. Random parameter latent class logit model is used in the estimation of the data. The results indicate that most of the respondents regard the new investment instruments positively. However, farmers prefer restricting ownership rights to members. Incentives for members to participate in financing cooperative growth could be designed with capital-based residual rights, mechanisms for transferability and for the appreciation of firm value. Estimation that considered choice difficulty improved model fit, which highlights the need to address respondent burden also in future studies of hypothetical investments in order to produce unbiased estimates. © 2018 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2018 CIRIEC},

This means that they generally operate in accordance with the principles endorsed by the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA). However, only a few of these organizations are successful in commercializing the agricultural produce of their members. In this study, we argue that growth-problems leading to commercial failure and organizational degeneration in these cooperatives can be attributed to a lack of managerial capital. Drawing on the literature and evidence from the field we set out key management solutions for counterbalancing cooperative principles in the context of rural Africa. These solutions were taught to the leaders and managers of 362 cooperatives at four training events held in Madagascar, Malawi and twice in Uganda. Using a production function for cognitive achievement and key informant interviews, we find that our training contributed to the adoption of the proposed solutions by some of the cooperatives. Using the Ugandan sub- sample, we estimate an OLS regression and a PSM model to show that the training translated into higher revenues per member generated through collective commercialization. © 2018 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2018 CIRIEC},

    abstract = {Recently there has been renewed academic interest in co-operatives. In contrast, media accounts of co-operatives are relatively scarce, particularly, in the United Kingdom, where business reporting usually focuses on capitalist narratives, with alternatives routinely marginalised until a scandal pushes them into the public eye. This article analyses media coverage of the United Kingdom’s Co-operative Bank (2011–2015), tracing its transformation from an unremarkable presence on the UK high street to preferred bidder for Lloyds Bank branches and its subsequent near collapse. The article charts changes in reporting and media interest in the bank through five discursive frames: member and customer service; standard financial reporting; human interest, personality-driven journalism; the public relations machine; and political coverage. Our analysis discusses three points: the politicisation of the story through covert and overt political values; simplification and sensationalism; and media hegemony. We argue that although moments of crisis provide an opening for re-evaluating the dominant reporting model, established frames tend to reassert themselves as a story develops. This produces good copy that reflects the interests of the publishers but does not extend understanding of co-operative organisations. Thus, the article identifies the role of the media in delegitimising organisations with alternative governance structures, thereby promoting ideological and economic conformity. © The Author(s) 2018.},

We discuss 56 peer-reviewed publications to illustrate the main findings and conclusions while outlining challenges and opportunities for future research. Generally, cooperative membership is found to positively impact price, yield, input adoption, income, and other indicators of member performance, yet there is growing evidence of an uneven distribution of benefits for small and large producers. In terms of structure, evidence of a causal relationship of ownership and governance to performance has been elusive, yet there are now many findings of inherent equity and long-term debt constraints, often in the context of consolidation to drive scale and scope economies. Further inefficiency is observed to be driven by increased heterogeneity in member attitudes and objectives, in particular in terms of commitment and participation. Thus, overall, empirical work portrays farmer cooperatives as flawed and complex business organizations which nonetheless have a strong positive impact on its members. While applied research may progress in various directions, a general improvement in empirical methodologies is needed to allow robust analysis of mixed objectives in dynamic environments. © 2018 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2018 CIRIEC},

The CEO decides regarding the deliveries of the member and the level of vertical communication in the centralized cooperative, while these decisions are taken by the members in the decentralized cooperative. We establish that the decentralized cooperative is efficient at an intermediate level of the VC cost coefficient and when the HC cost coefficient is above a certain level, while the centralized cooperative is efficient in the other cases. © 2016, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify financial stress and the causes of financial stress for agricultural cooperatives and provide management recommendations to stakeholders including cooperatives’ managers, boards of directors and lenders. Design/methodology/approach: This research used the geometric mean of the real rate of return on equity to identify financially stressed agricultural cooperatives. The real rate of return on equity allows the allocation of total financial stress among the return on assets, leverage and interest rate issues. Findings: This study found that financially non-stressed agricultural cooperatives had a higher rate of return on equity and rate of return on assets, but lower leverage ratios and interest rates than stressed agricultural cooperatives. Further, non-stressed cooperatives had higher total assets and sales compared to stressed cooperatives. This suggests that smaller cooperatives are more likely to face financial stress than larger cooperatives. The decomposition of the financial problem showed that a substantial percentage of financial stress was correlated with a low return on assets or profitability. A smaller percentage of financial stress was due to financing decisions. Originality/value: This study provides value by measuring the impact of profitability, leverage and interest rate on the financial performance of agricultural cooperatives. Results showed that a substantial proportion of financial stress was associated with a low return on assets. This indicates that profitability is a problem for agricultural cooperatives. This study also examines profitability during a period of volatile returns in production agriculture. © 2019, In accordance with section 105 of the US Copyright Act, this work has been produced by a US government employee and shall be considered a public domain work, as copyright protection is not available.},

    abstract = {The paper studies the current situation in the agricultural sector of Georgia, its impact on the country’s economy and possibilities of development. Agriculture is a traditional sector and it has always played an important role in economic and social development of Georgia. The country has favorable conditions for the development of agricultural sector. Despite urbanization processes in recent years, about half of Georgian population still lives in rural areas and most of them are employed or self-employed in this sector. Therefore, the level of development of agriculture in the country impacts the lives of significant share of the country’s population. Agriculture has been paid more attention by the government of Georgia in recent years. In particular, various programs and projects have been initiated and implemented in this direction. These programs aim at encouraging the development of various agricultural activities as well as development of processing industry, which will lead to increasing production and export of Georgian agricultural products. However, currently, development of agricultural sector in Georgia significantly lags behind other sectors of the economy mainly due to insufficient financing of this sector, lack of access to relevant technologies and lack of development of processing industry for raw agricultural materials. Therefore, a number of measures, like scientific-research activities, increasing the awareness of farmers, introduction of technological novelties and improvement of agro-insurance system that will enhance the competitiveness of the sector still need to be implemented. © 2019 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

In the last 15 years, the initiative had been used in South Africa; although no evidence of sustainable projects have been found. This study examined the challenges faced by some of the beekeeping cooperative societies (BKCSs) from Ngqushwa, Mnquma and Raymond Mhlaba in the Amathole District of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Data were collected between September and December 2014 and August and November 2015 from eight BKCSs in three local municipalities, using a random sampling technique. The findings revealed poor farm planning and orientation on the part of the farmers, pilfering from and vandalising of apiaries, poor skills training, poor management techniques, and weak agricultural extension support. The study suggests an integrated beekeeping and crop farming model as a viable option. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

    abstract = {Organizational integration between intra- and inter-organizational subsystems is an important factor of operational coordination, innovation, and strategic effectiveness. Scholars have mainly focused on the organizational integration of three sub-systems: production/operations, marketing/sales, and R&D. This study explored the organizational integration of the organizational unit in charge of the firm's IT and information systems: the IT function. This construct has five key dimensions: integration of the IT function with top management, business units, customers, non-IT suppliers, and IT providers. Analysis of data from 236 responses to a survey questionnaire confirmed that all five dimensions positively influence the firm's market performance. The contribution of the firm's information systems to both competitive and cooperative organizational capabilities strongly mediates this relationship. This research model highlights the complementary explanatory power of Lawrence and Lorsch's (1967) theory of organizational integration, the business-IT alignment literature, and the resource-based view (RBV). The results suggest that the more firms evolve towards IT-enabled business environments, the more they need IT managers to be socially embedded in these environments and to contribute actively to the overall knowledge-based organizational integration of the system. © 2017 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge},

Cooperatives offer a well-established livelihood strategy and means to support small-holders. This case study examined a Ukrainian cooperative using the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) to understand the role cooperatives play in addressing climate change, and the process by which capacity is used to adapt and/or mitigate climate change. Climate change does not prompt cooperative formation and climate change mitigation might not be a planned outcome in a livelihood strategy. However, modifying the SLF to include climate change outcomes provides a means of understanding the process by which building capacity results in mitigation and adaptation. Cooperative members and stakeholders outside of the cooperative participated in semi-structure interviews. Social capital emerged as a theme with interviewees from all backgrounds. Initially closed networks and distrust prevented members from joining the cooperative. As the cooperative built new networks, the benefit of joining became apparent to members. Information gained through networks improved access to other capitals, improved livelihood outcomes and addressed climate change. Social capital fulfils key roles in the process of capacity building and implementation of sustainable measures; thus improving social capital could arguably be the chief benefit of cooperatives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {Since the 1990s, producers of farm commodities have been attempting to enter value-added agri-food sectors by means of joint ownership of hybrid cooperatives. New generation cooperatives, characterized by substantial supply and equity requirements, inspired much farm producer optimism before revealing weaknesses and limitations in the early 2000s. In response, recent innovations in US cooperative state law introduced the limited cooperative association (LCA), a new legal entity allowing joint ownership by member patrons and member investors to facilitate large-scale equity acquisition. However, business registration data indicate few such organizations have been formed in the agri-food industry. The LCA is adopted by several small-scale operations in niche markets such as lamb, elderberry, and non-GMO seed, but there is not much interest among business organizations in the commodity sector. This paper raises possible explanations for the limited adoption of the LCA, including the competing objectives of farmers and investors, the ambiguous legal interpretation of investor objectives, the superiority of other legal structures, and the lack of strategic advantages. The conclusion facilitates an invitation to further study the challenging future of farmer cooperatives in the agri-food industry. © 2018, The Author(s).},

    abstract = {Because of inherent constraints, few farmer cooperatives use branding to pursue differentiation and competitiveness in the agri-food industry. Considering the complete lack of applied research on the brand–performance relationship for farmer cooperatives, it is unknown if branding is even profitable. This paper addresses the gap in our understanding with a novel panel study of 707 US marketing cooperatives for the 2005–2011 period. Informed by lagged observations of trademark and service mark data, the empirical analysis indicates a positive relationship of brand equity to the financial performance of marketing cooperatives. Specifically, 1% increases in the total stock of trademarks and service marks have a positive impact of $130,441 and $141,921, respectively, on the net sales of the mean marketing cooperative. The corresponding impact on net income is estimated at $3,815 and $17,286, respectively. Following the estimation of further specifications, there is also indication most of the impact is facilitated by older trademarks (>3 years) in the stock, which implies a delayed impact of brand equity on financial performance. Overall, the reported evidence serves as motivation to directors and managers of marketing cooperatives to pursue opportunities to build brand equity. To do so, however, may first require a solution to the equity constraint which appears at the foundation of most farmer cooperatives. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

    abstract = {In face of the advance of information technology and the emergence of Internet in the 21stcentury, the advance of technology and transportation has the demand and supply of agricultural products no longer be restricted to various countries or certain areas. It becomes urgent to ensure the quality (guarantee), integrity, safety, diversity, and relevant information (service) of agricultural products. Consumers’consumption ideas andhabits have been largelychanged. The marketing principles simply stressing on “quality”and “price satisfaction”could no longer satisfy customers’requirements. The circulation and supply processes of agricultural products therefore shouldbe controlled to ensure the excellent quality. The agricultural product supply chainmanagement is relatively important.Taking Nanping City Supply and Marketing Cooperativesas the research sample, Data Envelopment Analysis(DEA) is applied to evaluate the efficiency in this study. The variable data are acquired from open statistical data. The research results are summarized as below. 1.One DMUpresents strong executionefficiencyon agricultural product supply chain, showing the better agricultural product supply chain; 4 DMUs reveal the agricultural product supply chainexecution efficiency in 0.9~1, showing that the agricultural product supply chainexecution efficiency couldbe easily promoted; 5DMUs appeartheagricultural product supply chainefficiency lower than 0.9, which is obvious inefficient. 2.Sensitivity analysisis used for finding out key factors in the execution of agricultural product supply chainin order to understand the sensitivity to efficiency. The sensitivity factors contain productioncost, labor cost, response efficiency, and profit. Finally, suggestions are proposed according to the results. It is expected to enhance the quality, logistic, and information system of agricultural product supply chain, during the integration and innovation of agricultural product supply chain, for the coordinationand integration to more effectively execute thefrequent transaction. © 2019, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

    abstract = {Purpose: Rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) have long dominated China’s rural credit market and met most of agricultural credit demands while the existing literature seldom examines their contribution to agricultural sector. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth, using China’s provincial panel data from 1997 to 2014. Design/methodology/approach: Both static fixed effects models and two-step generalized method of moment dynamic panel data models, which control the endogeneity, are employed to identify the causality from RCC credit to agricultural growth in China. Findings: The results show that the credit from RCCs increases the agricultural output significantly. A 1 percent increase in RCC credit leads to agricultural growth of about 0.08 percent, which is robust to various empirical specifications. Further study shows that the contribution of RCC credit to agricultural growth decreases from the most developed eastern region to the least developed western region and increases over time. Research limitations/implications: The results imply that RCC credit is critical in financing agricultural activities by relaxing rural credit constraints and intense competition strengthens the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth by improving managerial efficiency and developing diversified financial products to meet better rural credit demands. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is first empirical study on the effect of RCC credit on agricultural growth despite of many on the role of financial development in agricultural growth. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore resilience strategies of Chinese street vendors in a shifted regulatory policy environment from a strength-based and entrepreneurial perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon nine in-depth interviews and naturalistic observations in an urban village of Guangzhou, China, the study empirically investigates how unregulated sidewalk-based hawkers struggle to survive against socioeconomic adversities compared with regulated vendors’ operations in a legitimate transitional market. Findings: Mirroring a sub-group of rural-to-urban migrants, street vendors espouse subtle strategies centering on purposefulness, resourcefulness and hardiness, which are instantiated through family obligation, sales tactics, merchandising techniques, technology application, trading flexibility, moral sentiment and assistance network. As such, street entrepreneurs are both enacting and constructing resilience in response to specific challenging contexts including impoverishment, operating cost inflation, contingent loss, fierce competition, market uncertainty, intensive workloads, municipal inspection and arbitrary governance practice of village cooperative organization. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding its limited generalizability, the result sheds light on crystallization of street vendors’ resilience and informs social services and policy remedies. Originality/value: The study provides a frame of reference to examine the interplay of resilience theory from psychology and entrepreneurship thesis from the field of business management by adding new evidence to the research on “entrepreneurial resilience” and potentially serves as a catalyst to enrich existing literature with an integrated perspective to comprehend the coping process of these necessity-driven micro-enterprise operators. The antagonistic understanding of informal economy is so predominating that it obscures structural oppression undermining social justice, whereas the spirit of self-reliance among street entrepreneurs is ought to be respected. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Thus, the Common Forests Modernization Act of 1966 was enacted, following successive modernization policies since the Meiji Restoration in 1868. We evaluated the impacts of the past modernization policies on the management of common forests by statistically comparing the performance of modernized and non-modernized 19,690 common forests based on the World Census of Agriculture and Forestry 2000. The performance measures for comparison included planting, weeding, thinning, and harvesting activities. We found less modernized, customary holdings are more active in tending activities such as weeding and thinning, while modernized holdings may have an advantage in harvesting and timber sales. © 2019 The Author(s). 4.0 International Licen.},

    abstract = {The feasibility of using hydroponically-grown (HGF) barley and oats forage as a supplement to natural pasture hay (PH) for sheep-feeding was investigated. Twenty-five intact Washera male lambs were used in both a 90 day feeding trial and a 10 day digestibility study. The treatments compared were: 100% PH (control, = T1); PH + a concentrate mix (CM) (= T2); PH + HGF barley (= T3); PH + HGF oats (= T4); and PH + 50% CM and 50% HGF mixture of barley and oats (= T5). Chemical composition of diets and refusals, feed intake and digestibility of DM and nutrients were recorded. The average HGF fresh biomass yields from 1 kg grain were 5.21 and 6.32 kg for barley and oats, respectively. The CP, NDF, ADF and ADL concentrations in HGF were 13.2, 45.6, 34.8 and 6.7% for barley and 13.7, 46.8, 36.6 and 7.6% for oats. All supplemented treatments had higher total DM intakes (12-21%) than the control (P<0.05) and all supplements produced marked substitution effects for PH (35-51%). Animals on the PH diet lost weight (17 g/d), while all supplemented groups gained weight (58-65 g/d). Partial budget analysis showed that the highest net return was for T5 followed by T2, T4 and T3. Hydroponically-grown oats forage could have potential to replace a commercial concentrate for supplementing sheep on native pastures, but both HGF and concentrates are probably unaffordable for the majority of smallholder farmers engaged in sheep production. Establishment of farmer cooperative hydroponic facilities could spread the overhead costs of the capital infrastructure and this approach should be investigated. © 2019.},

    abstract = {The following study looks at how traditional, organic, cooperative farmers starting a new farming cooperative in the US Southwest communicate about their farming as a set of (sustainable) cultural practices. The study draws on environmental communication theory, the theory of the coordinated management of meaning, and Vandana Shiva’s three-tiered economic model to construct a communication-based framework through which to view farmers’ stories about sustainability. This framework is productive, showing how some Nuevo Mexicano farmers (and others) orient toward farming, sustenance, and human-nature relationships through community, family, heritage, and education. Moreover, in addition to a conceptualization of sustainability as specific practices for nurturing and enduring in environments, communities, and organizations/institutions, sustainability can be understood as embedded ecocultural and historical experience with cross-cultural parallels in land-based communities. This study advances the ethical duty of environmental communication to better understand the ways in which environmental discourse and ecocultural and material realities are imbricated, as well as the call for such discursive study to be grounded in phenomenological experience of the natural world. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

    abstract = {The efficient management of agricultural water to meet its growing demand and to increase farm productivity has become a major concern in many agrarian countries. Various management principles, such as changes in governance, and crafting locally devised institutions have been prioritised in recent literature. The Nepalese government has considered farmers’ governance in managing irrigation systems as a successful irrigation policy. One of the measures for a successful farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMIS), each farmer must engage actively in collective choice actions and share both the costs and benefits from the system, proportionately. Various aspects in an institution affects farmers’ cooperative behavior to engage in the irrigation management process. A study of 232 FMIS in Nepal revealed that there is a need for a revised institutional design that can empower farmers by investing them with more defined property rights so that they can actively engage in maintenance activities. © 2018 by the authors.

A widespread intervention is the construction of agro-pastoral dams and irrigation schemes in traditionally pastoral communities that face a drying climate. Taking the Maji Moto Maasai community in southern Kenya as a case study, this article demonstrates that water access inequality can lead to a breakdown of pre-existing social capital and former pastoral cooperative structures within a community. When such interventions trigger new water uses, such as farming in former pastoral landscapes, there are no traditional customary institutional structures in place to manage the new water resource. The resulting easily corruptible local water management institutions are a main consolidator of water access inequalities for intervention beneficiaries, where socio-economic standing often determines benefits from interventions. Ultimately, technological adaptation interventions such as agro-pastoral dams may result in tensions and a high fragmentation of adaptive capacity within target communities. © 2018 by the authors.},

Yet, despite Tunisia was at forefront of introducing them, the uptake of SWCT by farmers has been less broad than desired. This study aims to identify and analyze those factors that have affected the rate of adoption of SWCT within the Sidi Bouzid governorate of Central Tunisia; a region that is representative of resource-poor environments within the country, and one where land degradation is of both historical and contemporary concern. Employing a binary logistic regression model, with data obtained from a survey of 250 farmers, our results suggest that socio-economic and institutional factors play an important role in the adoption of SWCT. Membership within an agricultural cooperative was positively correlated with adoption. Surprisingly, however, participation in organized trainings for SWCT was negatively correlated with adoption, similarly to livestock holdings. We provide plausible explanations for this counterintuitive finding, together with an argument that conventional processes for knowledge transfer and dissemination are in need of reform. © 2018, Bononia University Press.

The study was carried out in family farming farms in the Sumaré Rural Settlement, and in the area of Family Farming and Agroecological Cooperative (Cooperacra), respectively located in the municipalities of Sumaré and Americana, São Paulo State, Brazil. The methodology was based on a case study, using Focal Groups and Field Notes as research instruments. On the basis of our analysis, there were social changes in the farmers’ organization and in the decision-making process, as well as in the landscape in the areas of AFS and surroundings, where agroecological principles were also applied to production. In Sumaré, the four farmers participating in the project organized themselves to obtain organic certification. Cooperacra, which works with a group of 10 farmers advanced in the process of agroecological transition, starting from an intensive organic horticulture production system to a biodiverse agroforestry system. Despite the short time of the project, the construction of knowledge in relation to agroforestry systems was perceived through management techniques incorporated by the farmers in their agroecosystems. The arboreal component, which thus far the farmers had seen as something to be eliminated to realize agriculture, was introduced and became a relevant part of the process. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of AFS in the process of agroecological transition toward a more sustainable agriculture. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

The Lushan earthquake damage is less than the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake’s, where 70,000 houses collapsed and 2 million people across nineteen prefectures and 115 counties of Sichuan province were affected. Temple Village (fictitious name), an old village in S township, was chosen as an intervention site. As most young adults went to work in the city, the old community became dilapidated and its traditional culture, architecture, custom, skill and wisdom were dying. Social workers were unable to tackle fully this community’s multiple needs, especially those associated with environmental and physical spaces linked to notions of belonging and identity, on their own. A transdisciplinary action research team in which social workers operated hand in hand with the disciplines of architectural design became the means for exploring an alternative model of post-disaster community reconstruction that would enhance the quality of life of left-behind people in this disaster-affected community. Working together, the research team facilitated the formation of a community kitchen project that enabled villagers to create a new building and co-operative organisations for the village’s long-term sustainable development. This paper presents the participatory design process, contribution of green social work and transdisciplinary interventions in post-disaster community reconstruction. © The Author 2017.

Further, the special attributes of fresh agriculture products and unpredictable emergencies make agricultural supply chain likely subject to supply chain disruption risk, and these disruptions are extreme, although occurring with low frequencies, which leads to the shortage of downstream enterprises and customers, even severely reduces the performance of whole agricultural supply chain. The paper studies on the supply disruption risk problem faced by the supermarket’s purchasing. Assume a two-level option-based agricultural supply chain, which is consisted of the agricultural cooperative and the supermarket. Through numerical examples, compare the performance of different purchasing strategies (single, traditional dual, dual based on option contracts) under the setting of supply disruptions. The results show which under the supply disruption, the dual sourcing outperforms the single sourcing; the dual sourcing with option contracts brings flexibility, and maximizes the profit of the supermarket, which is the better purchasing strategy to prevent and avoid the disruption of a supply chain, providing decision-making reference for supermarket. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.},

    abstract = {Climbing beans offer potential for sustainable intensification in the East-African highlands, but their introduction requires a major change in the cropping system compared with the commonly grown bush bean. We explored farm-level opportunities, constraints and trade-offs for climbing bean cultivation in the eastern highlands of Uganda. We established current food self-sufficiency, income, investment costs and labour, and assessed the ex-ante, farm-level impact of four climbing bean options on these indicators. Input for this assessment were a detailed characterization of 16 farms of four types, and on-farm, experimental data of adaptation trials of climbing bean. Climbing beans generally improved food self-sufficiency and income, but often required increased financial investment and always demanded more labour than current farm configurations. Opportunities for integration of climbing beans on small farms were limited. Although some of the poorest farmers accrued the largest absolute benefits from climbing beans, their ability to make the necessary investments is questionable. The analysis was translated into a simple-to-use modelling tool to enable participatory analysis of the outcomes with farmers of the four farm types to understand their perspectives and decision-making. The discussions revealed a recent increase in market prices for climbing bean resulting in growing interest in their cultivation in the eastern highlands. A lack of seed and stakes was limiting climbing bean cultivation, and a sufficient amount of climbing bean seed needs to be ensured through strengthening of farmer cooperatives and improved storage. © 2018 The Authors},

The empirical results show that TE for cooperative members ranges from 79 to 86 per cent and that for non-members ranges from 74 to 84 per cent, depending on how biases are controlled. In addition, the efficiency levels of both members and non-members of cooperatives appear to be underestimated if the selectivity bias is not appropriately addressed.

    abstract = {Abstract: The ‘managed-metabolism’ hypothesis suggests that a ‘cooperation barrier’ must be overcome if self-producing chemical organizations are to undergo the transition from non-life to life. This dynamical barrier prevents un-managed autocatalytic networks of molecular species from individuating into complex, cooperative organizations. The barrier arises because molecular species that could otherwise make significant cooperative contributions to the success of an organization will often not be supported within the organization, and because side reactions and other ‘free-riding’ processes will undermine cooperation. As a result, the barrier seriously impedes the emergence of individuality, complex functionality and the transition to life. This barrier is analogous to the cooperation barrier that also impedes the emergence of complex cooperation at all levels of living organization. As has been shown at other levels of organization, the barrier can be overcome comprehensively by appropriate ‘management’. Management implements a system of evolvable constraints that can overcome the cooperation barrier by ensuring that beneficial co-operators are supported within the organization and by suppressing free-riders. In this way, management can control and manipulate the chemical processes of a collectively autocatalytic organization, producing novel processes that serve the interests of the organization as a whole and that could not arise and persist in an un-managed chemical organization. Management self-organizes because it is able to capture some of the benefits that are produced when its interventions promote cooperation, thereby enhancing productivity. Selection will therefore favour the emergence of managers that take over and manage chemical organizations so as to overcome the cooperation barrier. The managed-metabolism hypothesis demonstrates that if management is to overcome the cooperation barrier comprehensively, its interventions must be digitally coded. In this way, the hypothesis accounts for the two-tiered structure of all living cells in which a digitally-coded genetic apparatus manages an analogically-informed metabolism.

Commentators suggested that co-operatives, in particular credit unions, could provide accountability and sustainability through their open governance and mutual status. However, such suggestions assumed that co-operative principles and practice continued to underpin the efficacy of co-operative banking, and that credit unions, one of the most prevalent forms of co-operative banking, could offer a viable financial alternative. Instead, in the case of Cyprus, the financial crisis and the associated aftershocks triggered the nationalisation and demutualisation of credit unions. This prompted the researchers to question both the viability of a co-operative banking future and the extent to which co-operative principles were shaping decision making, governance, accountability and sustainability. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was adopted to explore the degree to which co-operative principles still shaped credit union thinking and stakeholder relationships. Findings: As is the case elsewhere within the co-operative movement, the findings point the fact that governance is weaken by the low membership participation and that the principles are no longer universally applied. Credit unions, if not co-operative banking, may not offer the financial assurances that commentators have called for. Moreover, the guiding principles may no longer be embedded within the fabric of the movement. Practical implications: Findings are important for practitioners/supervisory body as they highlight possible impacts on co-operative’ future and especially on their governance model and level of autonomy and independence in case of state intervention. Originality/value: The research undertaken is original as it is the first time credit unions in Cyprus were examined for adherence to co-operative principles. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The power generation of a wind farm depends on the efficiency of the individual wind turbines of the farm. In large wind farms, wind turbines usually affect each other aerodynamically at some specific wind directions. Previous studies suggest that a way to maximize the power generation of these wind farms is to reduce the generation of the first rows wind turbines to allow the next rows to generate more power (coordinated case). Yet, other studies indicate that the maximum generation of the wind farm is reached when every wind turbine works at its individual maximum power coefficient CPmax (individual case). This article studies this paradigm and proposes a practical method to evaluate when the wind farm needs to be controlled according to the individual or the coordinated case. The discussion is based on basic principles, numerical computations, and wind tunnel experiments. © The Author(s) 2018.},

    abstract = {Academics and development practitioners increasingly view cooperatives as the cornerstone for agricultural transformation and poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa. Cooperatives play a crucial role in promoting bulk storage and sale by smallholder farmers, which can play a major role in poverty reduction for farmers otherwise unable to commercialize. Despite the significant role of cooperatives, the reforms associated with economic liberalisation have caused many cooperatives in the region to fail. While efforts were made in Uganda to ameliorate this situation through the passing of the National Co-operative Policy (NCP), this has done little to enhance the survival of these cooperatives. In this opinion paper, we identify challenges faced by cooperatives that negatively impact performance and survival, such political interference, lack of administrative support, human resource constraints, inadequate knowledge of the operations by members and poor governance. This paper recommends stronger linkages between the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives and the Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF). Integrating cooperatives into the decentralisation framework and formalising existing village savings and loan association groups into formal cooperatives. Most importantly, the government needs to take on a more proactive approach toward cooperative development, as seen in some countries such as South Africa and Rwanda. © Afr. J. Food Agric. Nutr.

    abstract = {As Social Economy financial institutions, credit unions have traditionally been considered less efficient than traditional banking entities. However, like banks and savings banks, they have to be as efficient and competitive as possible to survive in today’s business environment, especially at times of crisis. To date, there have been very few studies on their efficiency and practically none for the crisis period. Moreover, almost all the existing studies assess only financial efficiency, without considering their social function. This study examines the levels of both financial and social efficiency in Spanish credit unions as well as their main determinants during the recent crisis. We apply the two-stage double bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology based on panel data corresponding to all the credit unions active in Spain between 2008 and 2013. The empirical results indicate that financial and social efficiency achieved an acceptable level, although on average the former was slightly greater than the latter. We also find that both age and merger and acquisition activity were positively influential on the financial efficiency of credit unions but had a significant negative effect on their social efficiency. Moreover, the regional location of such entities and the financial crisis were also crucial determinants of both types of efficiency. Our findings are therefore useful for all the stakeholders of credit unions to know if these entities have been efficient according to a double bottom line accounting in the crisis period and hence to maintain successful social management that is compatible with satisfactory financial efficiency. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

    abstract = {An important issue facing marketing cooperatives is that the overall quality of the product depends on the quality of farm products provided by individual members. We conduct an experiment to empirically investigate producer incentives to free-ride on quality among the members of a marketing cooperative in a setting where the average quality provided by cooperative members results in a collective rent that is distributed back to members in a patronage dividend levied in proportion to the quantity produced. Hidden actions by cooperative members that impact quality are imperfectly monitored, but free-riding, when detected, results in exclusion from cooperative returns. The randomized payoff structure of our game results in a novel experimental design that nests public good games and multi-player assurance games. Our findings indicate that free-riding on product quality is deterred when (a) cooperatives base patronage dividends on quality outcomes of smaller groups; (b) payoffs from free-riding are randomized by the possibility of exclusion from cooperative returns; and (c) cooperatives distribute a larger share of returns to members through indirect payments such as capital pooling and cost-sharing arrangements unrelated to product quality. © The Author(s) 2018.

    abstract = {The lack of a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for worker cooperatives is one of the main causes for their scarcity in the USA, as it causes ignorance and uncertainty even though cooperatives are one of several forms of doing business recognized by the Internal Revenue Code (like sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, LLC's, and Subchapter S corporations). Tax laws divide businesses into those categories, each with its own special tax provisions and worker cooperatives try to fit into any of those forms of business while "acting on a cooperative basis", thus, having their own specificities. Even though at a State level there are regulations for agricultural cooperatives in all States, there are only less than 30 States that have either worker cooperative regulations, general cooperative regulations or consumer regulations which worker cooperatives can use. However, the situation in the USA now demands for these entities. The fact that a particular attention is being given to worker cooperatives as an aftermath of the recent crisis is not news, as we have seen, historically2, cooperatives have traditionally emerged in situations where the public sector was unable to provide the response required by the people, for instance in support for financial access, housing, or decent livelihoods. As ZEULI and CROPP3 state it: "The historical development of cooperative businesses cannot be disconnected from the social and economic forces that shaped them. Co-ops then, as now, were created in times and places of economic stress and social upheaval". Different studies4 during the previous recession show how worker cooperatives increase their turnover and number of jobs, while other enterprises shrink, being this the reason why their study at this moment becomes a must. Thus, there should be a minimum understanding and control of what a worker cooperative is in order to be able to register and act like a real worker cooperative. Quoting GUTNECHT5 "allowing something that is not a cooperative to call itself a cooperative squanders a precious asset - the goodwill and public trust that reposes in the word 'cooperative'". Thus, the USA is missing a very important instrument in order to fight against unemployment, inequality, income maldistribution and unsustainable development at a time when there is a conscience by a majority of the population in different movements that demand a change. This change is possible if educational, cultural and legal issues are properly addressed, as it has been done in other countries and higher instances6, creating a fairer, equitable and more cohesive and sustainable society, thus a better world to live in. This paper aims to conduct a comparative statutory research on cooperative law for worker cooperatives in the USA, with a view of promoting an increased understanding within the academic and governmental communities, at a national and international level in order to promote worker cooperatives. In the case of New York public policies tacking this issue are already being devised. If this goal is achieved we will all benefit from them. © 2019 University of Deusto. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Agricultural cooperatives are a prominent economic organization for farmers in agro-food systems. Industrial organization and new institutional economics theories explain the existence of agricultural cooperatives and farmers’ participation in them through their ability to develop ‘countervailing power’ within markets and internalizing transaction costs, respectively. Using a unique dataset that includes community, cooperative, and household level survey data, this study empirically investigates the drivers of agricultural cooperatives formation and farmers’ membership and patronage decisions in Ethiopia. The results indicate that agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia tend to exist in locations that are connected to major roads with relatively well-developed market structures, supporting the industrial organization argument linked to market power for their formation more than the new institutionalists argument linked to overcoming potential contractual failures. A farm household's decision to join and use agricultural cooperatives, on the other hand, is strongly related to their location, scale of operation, specialization, and human and relational capital. A household's membership and patronage decisions are also affected by the size, specialization, and integration of the agricultural cooperative itself. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Partnership discourse is making advances in development dialogue as a means to improve the livelihoods of the agrarian populace. In Papua New Guinea, productive partnerships flourished during the early growth of the coffee industry. After the demise of plantations and rural mills in the lead up to political independence, the support services that plantations used to provide to smallholders, including centralised processing, have ceased as have price incentives for quality. Consequently, smallholders began to produce coffee of inconsistent quality and their productivity has also declined. However, coffee value chain partnerships have the potential to reverse the present decline of coffee production and increase the productivity of coffee farmers and address the inconsistency and the supply of low-grade coffee. Using two case studies of farmer cooperatives, we investigate collective action and also assess partnerships among present value chain actors. The case studies were supported with interviews of value chain actors to gain further insights into partnerships with farmer groups. This paper illustrates that through collective action and partnerships, coffee farmers can improve coffee production and quality, enhance governance systems in grower groups, attract community development services and diversify into other entrepreneurial activities. © 2019 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

For this research, a questionnaire was used to collect information on soil management and the use of agricultural terraces. Data collection was completed with 145 landowners and NTS users, along with rural extension and agricultural cooperatives. The results demonstrated that the return of erosion is likely due to the absence of crop rotation in favor of repetitive year-to-year planting of the same plant species (early soybean/maize [second harvest]/wheat), soil revolving to decompress the surface layer, and the elimination of agricultural terraces and the consequential downslope planting. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

    abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance level between the traditional agricultural cooperatives and the cooperatives with capital-seeking entities in the Greek food sector. Previous researches suggest that the performance of the cooperatives is determined by their organizational design. Thus, this fact imposes the need to examine if the organizational models applied by the agricultural cooperatives affect their profitability outcome. This is the first Greek survey on performance contrasting traditional agricultural cooperatives and cooperatives with capital-seeking entities. Financial data of 34 cooperative organizations were used in a profitability equation, estimated with generalized error-structure model for a 5-years period. The findings show that there are differences in the economic results and the factors affecting profitability between these two types of cooperatives, providing evidence that the organizational type affects performance. The results also indicate that there exists management inefficiency especially for the traditional cooperatives. Based on the particular findings, cooperative practitioners and policymakers could advance their knowledge in order to boost performance level in cooperatives. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

    abstract = {The water resources-water environment carrying capacity (WR-WECC) is an important indicator for judging the regional macro-control ability of water resources. The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is related closely to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resources rational exploitation, coupled human and environment, and ecological protection priority. Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade‐offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 2013–2015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {Data about the generation of empty pesticide containers (EPC) is scarce, even in countries where an EPC collection system is applied. In most cases, data refers to the total amount of EPC collected, which is lower than EPC generated depending on the extent of application of the collection project. Moreover, results are not correlated to the kind of crops, area and number of farmers involved, making impossible to use them elsewhere. This study aims at estimating EPC generation indices. It focuses on the indirect assessment of EPC generation based on information given by the agronomists of agricultural supplies stores and agricultural cooperatives (stakeholders) consulting farmers. For the study area (Pella prefecture in Greece), EPC waste production was estimated for arable crops, fruits and vegetables and it was found to range from 0.9 to 35.3 pieces/hectare depending on the crop type. The weight of empty plastic pesticide containers (EPPCweight) indices were calculated at 0.97 kg/ha and 4.36 kg/farmer/year which are close to the scarce available literature data. These results can be the basis for the design of an EPC management program in areas where data of this type of wastes is lacking. Other results of this survey indicate that stakeholders (depending on their capacity) could be motivated to organize and operate EPC collection stations as well as to help farmers to comply with the national management plan. Based on the above findings, three alternative scenarios for EPC management are proposed to provide a basis for designing an applicable regional EPC management program. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, previous literature has mixed results on the relationship between quantity growth and service supply effect of cooperatives. By conducting multiple correspondence analysis, descriptive statistics, and Pearson's chi-square test on survey data of 785 farmers, this paper aims to describe the characteristics of cooperatives' members and evaluate the current state of cooperatives' service supply from a demand-supply perspective. The results of the survey show that male, middle-aged, and middle-class farmers or farmers who plant local optimal crops are more likely to become the members of cooperatives. There is a huge gap between service supply and demand of farmers; cooperatives have a positive effect on reducing the degree of service demand. This effect is only significant when concerning sale, pest control, and mechanization. On the whole, there is a weak correlative relationship between the current service supply of cooperatives and the service demand of farmers in China. © 2018 by the authors.},

This toxic invasive plant prefers drier agricultural fields or grasslands. The aim of this paper was to study the distribution and population dynamics of H. mantegazzianum and to evaluate its management measures taken in the town of Spišská Stará Ves in the Kežmarok district located in northern Slovakia. H. mantegazzianum has successfully spread in the cadastral area of Spišská Stará Ves in the buffer zone of the national park of Pieniny. The total area of the PIENAP and its buffer zone invaded by H. mantegazzianum was approximately 457,000 m2. The research took place in 2013, on an area colonized by the species (28,900 m2) located on the land of the former agricultural cooperative farm. The taxon has spread mainly on abandoned areas (64.7% of the total area occupied by H. mantegazzianum), on permanent grasslands (28%) and along the banks of the Dunajec river (7.3%), where it formed polycenoses with a group dispersion. The population density of H. mantegazzianum decreased by about 46% on the research sites after the management measures provided in July 2013. It can be concluded that the management measures were poorly effective, because as evidenced by of the area occupied by the species. © 2019, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

With such an incomplete diffusion of the ISM technologies, the study estimated potential adoption rate to be 68.2%, while the actual adoption (JEA) rate was estimated to be 58.3% resulting in an adoption gap of 9.9% due to incomplete diffusion/exposure. In addition, diffusion and adoption of ISM technologies were found to be influenced by factors such as famer's years of farming experience, total farm size under maize cultivation, cooperative society's membership, attendance of farm workshop/seminars, on-farm trials and field days among others. Policy implications for increase productivity and food security through ISM technology diffusion and adoption were discussed. © 2018},

    abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the optimal strategies for both centralized and decentralized modes in a two-echelon omni-channel organic agricultural supply chain (OASC) which consists of one farmer cooperative and one online retailer. Furthermore, the contracts of cooperation between the members in OASC are discussed. Based on both theory differential game and bi-level programming, we utilize the Nerlove-Arrow model and Stackelberg model to examine five cases of decision modes for both agents in the OASC. Then, we achieve the optimal strategies where the specified sets of organic growing effort, organic traceability technology effort, propaganda input, and service input can guarantee the maximization of the related profits. As a result, we could obtain the values of the corresponding optimal profits. For the centralized decision mode, the farmer cooperative and the online retailer make decisions with the goal of maximizing the overall profits of the OASC. Meanwhile, for the decentralized decision mode with four different cases, each member will independently make a decision with the goal of maximizing his own profit respectively. In detail, as for the fully decentralized decision mode, no contracts exist in OASC; regarding the decentralized decision mode with an information traceability cost sharing contract, two members pay the information traceability cost together; and for the decentralized decision mode with a revenue sharing contract, two members share the revenue together; as to the decentralized decision mode with a comprehensive contract, there are two cooperative ways that information traceability cost sharing and revenue sharing can be achieved. In addition, we also considered factors such as the consumer preferences of organic products and the cross influence between channels in models. Finally, through sensitivity analysis and comparison of optimal strategies and profits, we found that: (1) high consumer preferences of organic products and high cross influence between channels are profitable; and (2) the choice of contract is influenced by the relative size of the offline marginal income ratio and the online marginal income ratio. © 2019 by the authors.},

    abstract = {This paper compares the cases of Seonheul 1-ri and Gasi-ri, where communities were built based on commons, but commons ownership modes were different. Seonheul 1-ri built a community based on "Dongbaekdongsan" owned by Jeju-do and the central government, while Gasi-ri built a community based on a common pasture owned by a farm association. In comparing these two cases, this paper will discuss how the difference in ownership modes affected the community building and commons management methods. This paper shows that a village's ownership of the commons may paradoxically interfere with the formation of a stable commons management body in some cases. Whereas the farm cooperative association, of which the members are 270 village residents, has the ownership of the common pasture in the case of Gasi-ri, the central government owns "Dongbaekdongsan" in the case of Seonheul 1-ri. Although both villages successfully built communities, in the case of Gasi-ri, the members of the village council, which is the commons management body, are divided into association members and non-association members. In the case of Seonheul 1-ri, all members of the village are equal in their statuses in the village council since there is no farm cooperative association with the ownership of commons. Therefore, the community of Seonheul 1-ri has a good structure for immigrants to settle into. The non-association members who have actively participated in community building in Gasi-ri are leaving, and thus the population of Gasi-ri is stagnant. On the contrary, the population of Seonheul 1-ri is increasing rapidly as the number of immigrating residents grows. Even when the village manages the commons, conflicts can be amplified in cases where some of the residents, or the association to which some but not all of the residents belong, owns the commons. Due to the inequality between persons with and without ownership, the managing body of the commons can become unstable. To stably promote community building, the commons should be owned by the village or the villagers rather than by outsiders, an enterprise, or the state. However, even when the village or the villagers have the ownership of the commons, if there is inequality among village residents around the commons it may interfere with community building or the maintenance of the sustainability of the commons. On the contrary, if the commons is expropriated by the government and the right of the village to stably manage the commons is guaranteed although the village does not have first-hand ownership, a community can be built and the sustainability of the commons can be maintained for a long time because the residents are equal. To manage the commons effectively to remain sustainable hereafter, village residents should be continuously filled, and to this end the village council should have an equal and open structure. © 2015 The Institute for Social Development and Policy Research.},

However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice-producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

Egg laying by moths and the distribution of larval populations are governed by the development stages of millet head and the soil type. Rainfall patterns affect the distribution of diapaused pupae. The implications of this information for future pest control strategies are discussed in this review. Control measures including the planting of pest tolerant/resistant cultivars, the application of chemical pesticides, and the abundance of natural enemies have had significant impacts on larval mortality but have limited application. In recent years, augmentative releases of the larval ectoparasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), have been tested in a pilot project in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. Because of the success of the program and the increasing demand for parasitoids farmers cooperatives are being engaged in producing parasitoids for the large-scale distribution of 'ready-to-use' bags containing braconids. This would sustain continuous availability and generate profitable businesses. To achieve this goal, farmers' economic problems and technical challenges need to be resolved at the village level, and marketing avenues need to be established. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

    abstract = {This paper highlights the issues of small-scale farming in Ukraine. The relevance of this scientific problem is that support of small-scale farming in Ukraine is very important for the social and economic development of the country. To develop optimal marketing and management policies for rural farmers, it is necessary to determine the challenges arise in Ukrainian small-scale farming towards its path to economic development. In order to determine important factors for small Ukrainian farmers, 120 small-scale farmers from Dnipropetrovs’k region involved in dairy, honey and vegetable production were surveyed. Among the respondents there were men and women aged 23-64, having a farm, family farm or a personal peasant household. Farmers were asked to name 3 challenges that matter, and indicate the strength of their influence (weak, average or strong). In addition, 10 personal interviews with farmers were conducted in order to find out more details about the responses in the questionnaires. The study identified two major groups of challenges for small-scale Ukrainian farmers. They are challenges in production process and marketing. The study showed that in order to manage these challenges and support the development of small-scale farming in Ukraine, the following recommendations can be made: farmers need to participate actively in the development of their own community and local production; cooperation has proved successful for dairy, vegetable, berries and cereals producers; it is necessary to keep on supporting the decentralization policy in small communities; it is necessary to ensure the protection of the small-scale farmers’ rights after abolition of the moratorium on the land sale, and at the same time, to control the use of these lands; it is important to choose agricultural systems safer for land and water, than the traditional system of agriculture in Ukraine; it is important for farmers to pay attention to their managerial qualities and upgrade them through constant education and training; local community leaders need to strengthen support for rural youth in order to reduce their migration to major cities. The results of the research can be useful for small-scale farmers, rural community leaders and agricultural cooperatives’ members. © 2019 University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest.

    abstract = {Recent advances in cooperative theory have focused on membership heterogeneity as being a significant challenge for cooperative sustainability. We use predictive analytics to forecast U.S. farmer cooperative sustainability at an aggregate level and include multiple dimensions of membership heterogeneity. We report the importance and shape of the effect of membership heterogeneity when predicting and forecasting cooperative sustainability in the near-term. We also report forecasts of cooperative sustainability given expected changes to membership heterogeneity. The data this study used are from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Economic Research Service (ERS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) joined with USDA-Rural Development cooperative financial data at the state level. Membership heterogeneity was found to be less relevant than other variables included in the model for predicting cooperative business volume and number of cooperatives headquartered per state, and an estimate of cooperative sustainability. Membership heterogeneity effects were mostly offsetting given expected changes to member heterogeneity, and/or were offset due to changes to other macro factors. Consequently, we conclude membership heterogeneity may affect the number of cooperatives and extent consistent with theoretical literature at a micro level; however, we also expect a similar level of sustainability of cooperatives at an aggregate level in the near-term despite changes to membership heterogeneity. © 2018 by the authors.},

Many co-operatives have been converted into the so-called hybrid co-operatives, owned together with external financiers. This article applies governance cost theory to explain this development. The results show that members are not able to govern a collectively owned firm that is large and complex; members are thus reluctant to invest in co-operatives; and members do not perceive that co-operatives benefit them economically. Thus, strong leaders take control and non-member investors gain ownership and influence. © The Author(s) 2018.},

    abstract = {While scholars who study issues of food justice use the term food power rarely—if at all—their arguments often position the rise of the food justice movement in the context of food power that sustains oppression in the food system. Similarly, many food justice activists and organizations produce an analysis of oppressive forms of food power, while placing the goals of the movement to create sustainable community-based interventions in the periphery. Yet, the pursuit of food justice is a dual process related to power. This process is characterized by the simultaneous acts of dismantling oppressive forms of food power and building emancipatory forms of food power. It also has deep roots in the historical arc of food politics in the Black Freedom Struggle of the civil rights era. However, we know very little about this dual process and how black communities engage in it. In this paper, I juxtapose two cases of black farm projects—the historical case of Freedom Farms Cooperative (FFC) in Mississippi and the contemporary case of the Rocky Acres Community Farm (RACF) in New York—to explore the dual process of food justice. I conclude with a brief discussion on what the cases teach us about this dual process and its implications for scholars and activists who work on issues of food justice. Such implications provide insights into the possibilities of the food justice movement in the future and challenge the movement to include, more explicitly, issues of race, land, self-determination, and economic autonomy. © 2019 by the Author.},

Certified, elder and educated farmers who have off-farm income and trust in the cooperative leadership have been found to side-sell significantly less.

    abstract = {Kenya's Arabica coffee is highly rated in the world and is a major source of income for over half a million smallholder farmers. Production has declined by 50% over the past 25 years despite efforts by initiatives. This study tries to unravel what drives coffee production in Kenya. Data were collected on six cooperatives through household interviews and discussions with farmers, cooperative officials, and key informants. Yields ranged from ten to 3889 kg/ha/year, averaged 474 kg/ha/year and were positively correlated with intensity of crop management (r = 0.09, P < 0.05). Coffee represented about 25–50% of total household income. The oldest farmers (average 63 years) were poorer, had less diversified income sources and managed coffee less intensively than younger farmers. Intensity of management differed among cooperatives and was positively correlated with trust in the cooperative (r = 0.209, P < 0.001). Households that received credit from marketers were 30% more likely to use fertilizers than other households. We show that the yield gap can be closed by existing practices, and intensification is influenced by household characteristics and services received. We conclude that increasing the participation of young farmers in coffee production and creating an enabling environment for intensification can have a positive and sustainable effect on national production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {The food market is experiencing a period of deep tensions between farmers, food companies, and retailers across the world. This is particularly true in Italy, a Mediterranean country with a strong agricultural tradition and a great interest in the food market. The largest market weight in terms of food retail in Italy is held by national chains linked to the cooperative movement (Coop and Conad) that has promised to ensure more collaborative and less imbalanced relationships between producers and distributors, along with a stronger connection to the territory and socially responsible corporate management. The Coop is currently the biggest cooperative in Italy. Its increasing power in the Italian food retail system has caused it to behave like an oligopoly that has exploited its proximity to left-wing parties to obtain an advantageous position in some markets (ex: Emilia, Liguria, etc.). Equally alarming is a growing financialization which has led to the bankruptcy of CoopCa and Coop Operaie of Trieste, affecting approximately 20,000 investors. The recent crisis in food retail is redirecting firms' strategies and producing new forms of food distribution such as Alternative Food Networks that are trying to restore the mission and values of the old consumer cooperatives. © 2018 by the authors.},

The results revealed that Khao Hin Sorn Agricultural Cooperative Rice Mill Ltd. is royal patronage which is supported by various agencies such as the Cooperative Promotion Department, and Land Development Department. This cooperative collected paddy from 10 farmer members, with average amount of paddy at 14 tons per year, and the paddy were delivered to the cooperative rice mill for processing. The full mill capacity is 1.2 ton of paddy per day. The service charge rate is one Thai baht per kilogram. The cooperative has produced rice in both packaging and non-packaging for sale to consumers by themselves. Regarding the SWOT analysis results, concerning the strengths, the cooperative rice mill was royal patronage that can provide inexpensive milling service charge for farmers. Additionally, operation staff had experience in rice milling for a long time. Whilst the weaknesses were the rice mill without checked the quality of paddy before milling-process and did not have the specialized technicians to repair a milling machine as well as budget deficit. In terms of the opportunities, the rice mill had a wide range of support from organizations of budgeting, staff, and administration. Moreover, farmers was preferred consuming rice grown by their own. Finally, the threats were the rice mill which located in a non-rice-farming area, and it operated less than the full milling capacity. The collaboration with supply chain partners should be encouraged to increase the quantity of paddy for the milling process. © 2018 International Journal of Agricultural Technology.All rights reserved.},

From fixed effect model estimate, discretional factors such as size, profitability, management quality and solvency positively associate with credit union loan business whiles loan loss, net worth, non-loan income and non-loan activities associate negatively. Contractionary monetary policy creates an increase in loan demand in the credit union. Credit union managers should monitor developments taking place in the loanable funds market as increasing overhead cost of banks may imply a possible increase in loan demand leading to diseconomies of scale.

This paper targets at exploiting factors predicting the way that farmers use chemical input, based on first-hand data from 145 vegetable farmers with the membership of cooperatives in China. The role of social capital is investigated beyond traditional determinants. There are three indicators of social capital adopted in this paper, communication of technology and market information, trust, and members’ awareness of common goals. We identify three ways of chemical input use in field investigation. They are using chemical input according to own experience and the instruction on the package, under the guidance of the government, and under the guidance and monitoring of cooperatives. The findings of empirical analysis highlight the role of social capital in influencing the way farmers use chemical input. The awareness of common goals incentivizes farmers to use fertilizer under the guidance of the government and cooperatives, while all the three aspects of social capital are significantly associated with the way that farmers use pesticide. To be specific, farmers in a cooperative with a higher level of communication, trust, and common goals display the tendency to using chemical input based on external guidance rather than own experience. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Consequently, cooperatives studies have tended to examine economic outcomes, such as productivity and job security, comparing them to conventional business firms. Nevertheless, cooperatives are membership associations and have organizational characteristics in common with other types of voluntary associations. Furthermore, one explicit organizational principle of cooperatives is concern for community, and their contributions to the community have been covered frequently by media. Therefore, it is imperative to examine cooperative members’ community engagement, and compare it to other types of association members. Using a national sample of Venezuelans, the relationships between association memberships and community involvement were compared across different types of associations. The results showed that cooperative members had a higher likelihood of being involved in community matters than those from other types of associations. Although the Venezuelan cooperatives have received vast support from the Chavez government for community development, this result can have an implication on the cooperatives’ organizational identity as those who provide members with resources necessary for civic engagement beyond the organizations. © 2017 Eastern Sociological Society},

We analyse cooperatives’ inclusiveness of smaller herders and farmers and cooperatives’ governance structures. The research is based on data collected in selected provinces of the central Töv region. The data were collected for three distinctive target groups – cooperative board members, cooperative members and non-members. We found that the cooperative sector in Mongolia is strongly affected by the governmental policy regarding wool subsidies, which provides subsidies only to cooperative members and has consequently caused rapid growth in the number of new, free-riding cooperative members and led to very low levels of members’ self-identification with their cooperatives. This policy also affects the inner organizational structures of cooperatives. Further, we found indications that poorer farmers tend not to be members of cooperatives and that the overall benefits for non-members and the general community arising from local cooperatives are rather low. © 2017 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2017 CIRIEC},

    abstract = {Cooperatives have the potential to develop an economic, social and environmental activity in a sustainable manner. In particular, social management is aimed at meeting the needs of its partners, families and community in an efficient and effective way. A study of social management was carried out in 60 savings and credit cooperatives in Pichincha, Ecuador, to determine if this is carried out under sustainability principles, with the determination that the recognition of social responsibility and the integral management of the economic and social issues, depends on the segment to which they belong, in which the non-definition of the social budget has a negative influence. The ignorance of the partners about the principles of Cooperativism; the inexistence of Cooperative Education Committees, specifically environmental education and action programs; the lack of granting credits for partner undertakings and the non-application of the cooperative social balance sheet are also other issues that damage the correct functioning of these associative forms. There were recognized areas to be strengthened to guarantee the sustainability of cooperatives as an associative form, such as the definition of social objectives; the active participation of the partners in decision-making and of another two interest groups (families and community). © 2018 General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.},

One approach hereby is to use multi-stakeholder innovation systems, such as the ‘Nicaraguan Learning Al-liance’ (NLA). However, tools for the evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems are rare. This paper reports on the implementation of a conceptual framework to carry out an impact evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems using the NLA as the object of study. The assessment focused on the business relationship constructs of trust and capacity development. Survey interviews, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions collected data from agribusiness stakeholders linked with the NLA and from a control group of stakeholders involved with other networks. The quantitative data were analysed through factor and regression analyses. Results from the quantitative analyses were triangulated with qualitative data. The analysis shows that the NLA has been successful in developing smallholder farmers’ capacities as a result of trust developed through its dedicated project managers. Nonetheless, the NLA has not been more successful at developing agribusiness capacities among Nicaraguan farmers than other networks with the same goals. Results from this study point to the need for facilitating more interactions between the different networks of farmers’ cooperatives and organisations with other stakeholders already active within the Nicaraguan agrifood innovation system. © 2018, Kassel University Press GmbH.

    abstract = {This article analyzes the limitation of cooperation and the expansion of conflict between states in cyberspace. Like traditional security spaces around the world, global cyberspace is also an anarchy system with no absolute authority or institutional status. In such a situation, based on cyber sovereignty and cyber power, the state tries to create an institution applicable to domestic and international cyberspace to make a cyber system favorable to the state itself. Since, unlike traditional power, cyber power has both material and non-material elements, a state cannot know the level of another state's cyber power. For this reason, conflicts among states in the cyber domain are intensifying. The most active states competing for the upper hand in cyberspace are the United States and China. They lead to different levels of recognition and strategies concerning the cyber domain. While the competition between the United States and China invites conflict, it also triggers temporary cooperation among states. The UN's cybersecurity activities are also fragmented by various inter-government institutions and management organizations. However, the differences in strategy between the United States and China affect other states. Ultimately, although the direction of discussions on cybersecurity has been set based on the Group of Government Experts activities in the UN and the need for inter-state cooperation has been acknowledged, such cooperation would be only temporary because states consider domestic policy and strategy to be more important than international or regional cooperative organizations. © 2017 Center for International Studies, Inha University},

Data were collected from a maguey pulquero cooperative society through the use of a strategic planning and investment instrument. The commercial diagnostic phases, market research and products portfolio design were considered. To obtain information for the portfolio, a productive chain analysis was conducted, considering productive links, post-harvest management and commercialisation. Market research was done in two important market centres in influential regions, where knowledge and frequency of consumption of maguey pulquero products was identified. The Boston Consulting Group Matrix was used to integrate the portfolio’s products and by-products, and the Ansoff Matrix was employed to determine the product’s positioning. Finally, an investment and economic viability analysis of the products portfolio was carried out. Six products were identified, with pulque and agave syrup being the investment priority products owing to the profits they generate. Penca, ixtle and paper generate complementary income. The strategies for pulque and agave syrup are market penetration, and the strategies for the remaining products are market and product development. The analysis of products include positive-to-net present value, investment return rate and cost benefit ratio. © 2018 Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare di Firenze. All rights reserved.},

According to the economic theory of cooperativism, the results show that these entities come closer to the pecking order theory, i.e. policies that maximise the prices received by members to the detriment of the entity's self-financing abilities, coupled with restrictions on cooperatives' equity capital that may lead them to use debt to fund growth. The results also show positive relationships between cooperatives' indebtedness and other factors, such as investments in non-current assets, liquidity and cooperative size in terms of turnover per member. © 2018 Mateos-Ronco and Guzmán-Asunción.},

    abstract = {The Chinese government faces a great challenge to safeguard the safety of the food supply chain due to the significant fragmentation of producers and weak institutional resources to monitor and enforce safety standards. Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called “One Farm Household, Two Production Systems” (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years. This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for famers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow “Green Food” are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides. © 2017},

Applying the concept of adjustment to present value (APV) is the main point of this study, which was not taken into account when ICPC 14 was elaborated. Analysis of the statutes of cooperatives indicates, as a common characteristic, the obligation to always pay the redemption of members' quotas in a period of more than one year, and this leads us to conclude that for a reliable representation of the phenomenon it is necessary to recognize the APV of this reclassified liability. © 2017 FEA.

Farm-level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures. © 2017 The Authors.},

    abstract = {The concept ‘governing through the community’ has been used frequently to interpret the neoliberal policy embraced by Australian governments since the 1990s. Yet explanation is still inadequate of how ‘governing through the community’ is conducted in practice, particularly the specific mechanisms that regulate interaction among government agencies, groups seeking to represent the community and individuals in the community. In this study, we find that ‘governing through the community’ is actually ‘governing through representatives of the community’ because it is the representatives that make the community visible and governable. This observation is based on a case study of three kinds of farmer organizations, in two states of Australia, who see their role as serving the community and are regarded by outsiders as representatives of the community at least on certain issues. An understanding of the interaction among different stakeholders within and outside of the community is developed through three themes of ‘paperwork’, ‘data’ and ‘price’ that were used by locals from Landcare groups, grower groups and farmer cooperatives, respectively, to articulate how they experience the mechanisms through which their interactions are regulated. This paper concludes that these groups can claim to represent some residents within a defined geographical area, rather than any exact definition of ‘the community’ and that this is a sufficient claim to enable these groups to participate in the process of ‘governing through the community’. The tensions between government agencies, community representatives and community members threaten the legitimacy of the community representatives as intermediaries. Government agencies do try to contribute to reduce these tensions by strengthening the legitimacy of community representatives through various policy and project mechanisms. However, while the stated aim of ‘governing through the community’ is often focused on producing a ‘flourishing rural community’ through improving democratic modes of representation, this study demonstrates that it is only part of the community, namely the ‘targeted customers’ of the farmer organizations, that is potentially reachable to ‘the state’. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

It was found that less water supply, less availability of live food and unsubsidized electricity supply were the main constraints. Low selling price of fish and large number of middlemen were hindering factors in marketing of ornamental fish. Also, lack of special trainings, non-Availability of crop insurance schemes and less credit facility were other major constraints faced by ornamental fish producers. Constraints faced by them need to be effectively addressed by Government and policy makers. Continuous supply of water, availability of live food and supply of electricity at a rate par with agriculture sector Is needed. Marketing of fish by forming marketing cooperative societies and innovative ways like mobile apps should be explored.

    abstract = {Smallholder farmers in developing countries face a competitive disadvantage in modern agricultural supply chains. Joint marketing through cooperatives is a potential tool to mitigate these disadvantages; yet cooperatives’ success in these settings is uneven at best. We develop an analytical model to study a farmer's choice of selling to a private trader who pays cash on delivery but may exercise market power or a cooperative that promises a price premium but delays payment and carries a concomitant risk of default. In the presence of impatient and risk-averse farmers, we show that these factors can severely limit smallholder patronage of a cooperative, despite a promised price premium. We then construct and parameterize a simulation model to fit a profile of heterogeneous farmers within a prototype developing-country village, and study the optimal decisions of farmers regarding marketing through a cooperative versus a private trader. Results suggest that modest improvements in either timeliness of payment or probability of default can induce a substantial increase in a cooperative's market share and economic viability. Extending the simulation analysis to a dynamic setting shows how implementing reasonable policies to improve a cooperative's payment timeliness and default probability can markedly improve its growth trajectory. © 2018 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

SACCO representation in microfinance datasets is biased. Drawing on so-far unexploited datasets of Ugandan SACCOs and savings groups, this paper empirically analyses policy debate regarding SACCO- and savings group regulation. The findings point to the relevance of practically implementing the principle of ‘cooperation between cooperatives’ to ensure effective governance at SACCO level. Moreover, the paper introduces two new measures, based on members' savings and shares, which could become useful tools to track the application of cooperative principles in developing countries, and hence improve evidence-based policy-making for SACCOs. © 2016 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC},

    abstract = {Purpose: Studies on the performance of agribusiness cooperatives in Brazil focus on economic and financial aspects. The purpose of this paper is to further delve into such studies by investigating which commonly measurable structural production factors (horizontal, vertical and lateral diversification; operating area; number of associates; and time in operation) have greater impacts on the financial performance of such cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve such a goal, a survey was conducted with a sampling pool divided by size (annual net revenues of US$ 50 million or higher), and the questionnaire was employed as a method of data collection. The sample was concentrated in the southern, south-eastern and mid-western regions of Brazil; classified by size; and deemed adequate after several adequacy tests. Findings: The results were analysed using Spearman’s correlation, which showed that there were no significant correlations between the structural production factors considered in this study and the economic-financial performance of agricultural cooperatives, which leads to questions about the effectiveness of employing diversification strategies with a conjoint approach. Nonetheless, it was possible to identify several relationships not mentioned in the original hypotheses that might be addressed further in future studies. Research limitations/implications: The data obtained should be interpreted with caution because heteroscedasticity was detected. Although the cause could not be clearly identified, the presence of heteroscedasticity could mean that smaller and similar cooperatives present similar variation in their diversification and production base strategies. Originality/value: This work sought to generate knowledge regarding operations management, which was achieved by demonstrating that production diversification in a dynamic and relevant economic sector, that is, agricultural cooperatives, is limited in terms of financial return when performed in an isolated mode. Hence, cooperatives’ production managers should take into account the totality of structural production factors during their planning activities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the development of rice supply chain in the context of the role of rice farmer organizations and cooperative networks in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach – Primary data were solicited from the cooperatives and members of cooperatives for this study through questionnaire administration. The questionnaire containing a five-point Likert scale was posed to respondents to ascertain their problems before and after joining the network (for cooperative) and after joining the cooperative (for members). This study employed the independent two-sample student t-test (two-tailed) to test for significant difference in the means of scores regarding the problems of cooperatives before and after the cooperative network, and also to test for significant difference in the means of scores of the problems of members of the cooperatives before and after joining the cooperative. Findings – The study revealed that key production and marketing problems such as increased transaction costs and market uncertainties confronting the cooperative organizations have been diminished as a result of the networks. Key problems of the members of the cooperatives such as exploitation and opportunistic behavior of traders to whom they sell their products have been reduced as a result of joining the cooperatives. Research limitations/implications – This paper is not without caveat. The governance structures in relation to leadership, financial arrangements and bargaining power balance have not been analyzed in this study and these are avenues for further research. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first that examined the combined roles of farmer organizations and cooperative networks in developing the rice supply chain in Thailand. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The research focuses on the assessment of the MFIs (Micro Financial Institutes) & Small Business in Bangladesh; it focuses on the impacts of microcredit for growth & development of small businesses and improves poverty condition. Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world with low GDP/capita and minimum purchasing power. Almost a third of the total population (165 million) of the country lives below the national poverty line ($2/day). Growth & development of sustainable level of small businesses, which create employments for low & semi-skilled workers, mainly self-employments, are considered one of the most effective ways to lift the nation out of the vicious cycle of poverty, are target & attention of the country. To pave the way for MFIs since 1970s, especially during the new wave of microcredit in the 1990s, has come to be seen as an important development policy and a poverty alleviation tool in Bangladesh. The aim of the paper is to analyse existence MFIs and its microcredit policies and propose effective microcredit policies for growth & development of small businesses and socio-economic development. The researcher undergoes a field survey using a semi-structured questionnaires and a scheduled face-to-face interview in Bangladesh. These analyses and the concept of the method of assessment of the impacts of microcredit determine the research methodology, research questions and the hypotheses which form the ideological basis of the research dissertation as well as its scientific contribution. © 2018, ASERS Publishing House.

    abstract = {Social mechanisms underpinning collaborative approaches to pest management are as important as the biological control of the pest. To facilitate the success of an area-wide management approach, social factors need to be understood and addressed. This study qualitatively analyses social, psychological and institutional barriers and facilitators for the widespread adoption of area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly, and attitudes towards the use of sterile insect technology. Interviews were conducted (N = 35) with fruit growers, industry representatives, agronomists, government representatives and community leaders from across the dominant horticultural regions of southeastern Australia. Transcripts were analysed and compared based on thematic organisations. Growers and stakeholders expressed high acceptance for area-wide management of Queensland fruit fly and the use of sterile insect technology. However, participants reported limited knowledge of both area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Factors found to facilitate acceptance were perceptions of increased market access, increased social awareness, operationalising community champions and value chain actors, as well as dissemination of credible scientific evidence. Trust in those individuals advocating area-wide management and sterile insect technology, and interpersonal trust between neighbours, was also seen as an important factor affecting adoption of area-wide management and sterile insect technology. Barriers to acceptance included perceptions of costs and ongoing funding needs, lack of knowledge, apathy towards control of Queensland fruit fly, compatibility of area-wide management and sterile insect technology with current practices and a lack of social cooperation amongst growers. The data show a need to increase growers’ awareness of costs and benefits associated with Queensland fruit fly control and an understanding of the direct and indirect consequences of their own on-farm behaviours with respect to control. This study is the first to use a psychological lens to explore and distil grower and stakeholder attitudes towards a cooperative management approach for a pest of national significance. Results provide insight into beliefs that guide underlying biosecurity decision-making and can help improve uptake of other area-wide control techniques. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

    abstract = {In the wake of Cuba's far-reaching, halting economic reforms, geopolitical rapprochement and trade openings with the United States (US) offer opportunities and risks for Cuban small-scale farmers and agrarian cooperatives: pressures, paradoxes and potential abound. Meanwhile, on the margins, agro-ecologically oriented tours bring admiring US students, farmers and agrarian advocates. Cubans concur that the country must solve key problems in its agricultural sector to overcome the contradictions of its agri-food model, and that this entails more exchange with the US – but in what capacity and on what terms? The current crossroads begs the classic agrarian question, even as it updates it. Having experienced and survived the promises and disasters of both capitalist and communist agricultural economies, Cuban farmers expand the original ‘peasant’ protagonist. As they navigate new non-state markets and recent re-entrenchment of state control of prices, Cuban farmers and cooperatives struggle to avoid monopolizing tendencies of unfettered capitalist as well as communist agricultural economies – both of which have historically been ecologically damaging. US agribusiness courts Cuba, but not as mere unidirectional capture: Cubans are inviting and leveraging trade to end the embargo, which is increasingly being modified altogether. Key Cuban agrarian principles of resilience and cooperativismo have persisted through capitalist and communist crises: could they influence prospects for agro-industrial hegemony from the North?. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Information on laws regulating financial cooperatives, the supervisory approaches adopted, and deposit insurance schemes in sixty-five developing countries were collected—mostly—from original legislations for the period 1995–2014. Key findings suggest that indicators of financial cooperative development are positively correlated with the existence of a specialized regulation; supervision under non-bank financial supervisory authorities; and the presence of deposit insurance schemes, while general cooperative society’s regulations and banking regulations are negatively correlated with financial cooperatives’ indicators. These results are robust after controlling for economic and institutional factors as well as potential endogeneity bias. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

The influence of uninsured depositors is generally more significant for small credit unions than large credit unions. The results for the precrisis period are not consistent with those of the postcrisis period. However, the results are consistent across the six-year period following the financial crisis. Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that uninsured depositors are value-maximizing stakeholders who exercise control over the firm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

It analyzes the factors that contribute to an accelerated failure time (AFT) using information from customers’ credit applications as well as information provided in their credit report. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigates the factors that affect credit risk using survival analysis by employing two primary models – the AFT model and the Cox proportional hazard (PH) model. While several studies employ the Cox PH model, few use the AFT model. However, this paper concludes that the AFT model has superior predictive qualities. Findings: This paper finds that the factors specific to borrowers and local factors play an important role in the duration of a loan. Practical implications: This paper offers an easily interpretable model for determining the duration of a potential borrower. The marketing department of credit unions can then use this information to predict when a customer will default, thus allowing the credit union to intervene in a timely manner to prevent defaults. Further, the credit union can use this information to seek out customers who are less likely to default. Originality/value: This study is different from the previous research due to its focus on credit unions, which have distinct characteristics. Compared to similar lending institutions, the charter of the credit union does not allow management to sell off loans to other investors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically test the dairy production barriers: lack of cooperation between the chain actors, milk quality deficiencies, rural exodus and, productivity limitations in southern Brazil, based on Santa Catarina’s dairy production ecosystem players perceptions. Design/methodology/approach: From inquiry result analysis with 305 dairy sector experts, the authors performed statistical tests using the technique of factorial analysis and confirmatory factorial analysis to confirm and/or refute the dairy production barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). Findings: The results confirmed the presence of the barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The barrier lack of cooperation between the chain actors is presented as the biggest obstacle in the sector, according to the interviewees. The authors also found that rural exodus is the barrier with the smallest impact on the dairy sector development in relation to other barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The confirmation of these barriers in practice allows developing new studies to eliminate and/or mitigate these barriers of the dairy sector. Furthermore, the study might shed some light on dairy production activities and help improve management skills. Research limitations/implications: This study does not cover all the players that make up the dairy production ecosystem. It is limited only to the main players that are inserted in this sector. The authors observed the lack of data characterizing the dairy production system in Santa Catarina. Originality/value: This study presents theoretical and practical contribution. By the confirmation that these barriers are present in the field, it is possible to direct new studies that seek to mitigate them and results in dairy production improvements. As for the practical contribution, the confirmation of those barriers can serve as a basis for the dairy sector decision-making actors, such as government, research institutions, and extension, producers, cooperatives, among others, and assist them in developing strategic actions that concern a cooperative way to develop the whole sector. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Such incentives derived from marketing cooperatives include indirect benefits such as reduction in transaction costs arising from participation in imperfect factor and product markets. However, whether marketing through cooperatives also creates direct economic benefits as additional incentives by securing competitive producer prices is not empirically established in the relevant development literature to augment related policy debates and to rationalize investments on such institutions. Using a farm economic model on producer price data taken from Ethiopian smallholders who produce sesame as a traditional cash crop, this paper empirically tested the power and influence of the cooperative institution on the level of producer prices received by farmers. The results show the instrumental role of marketing cooperatives in terms of securing competitive producer prices to farmers. The evidence provides empirical support to justify the desirability of revitalizing institutional marketing schemes as appropriate mechanisms to improve the economic incentives of smallholders for better market participation and commercialization towards poverty reduction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The key engine for this marketing experiment is the Sahaja Aharam Producer Company Limited (SAPCO), a producer organisation. SAPCO has tried to create new supply chains that guarantee that the produce it sells complies with the quality standards needed to certify the foods as ‘organic’. SAPCO is an initiative of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) which has taken up the bulk of the financial and administrative burden of managing the company. The revival of traditional knowledge for organic farming and the marketing of organic produce has invariably required the intervention of external agents such as CSA. In the final section, we assess the achievements of SAPCO from the viewpoint of the small farmers who belong to the producer co-operatives that make up SAPCO’s membership. Our key research question is whether it has been possible to scale up the production and marketing of small farmers’ output and create a new supply chain independent of local intermediaries. © 2017 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.},

An analysis of the pre- and post-regulation impacts on compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements is also performed. Findings: The results, which are in support of the institutional theory, reveal that licensed SACCOs engage in higher compliance with mandatory disclosures, and this improves from the pre- to the post-regulation period. The results show that SACCOs under inquiry engage in lower compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements, especially in the post-regulation period. The findings also reveal a significant and positive association between SACCO size, co-operative governance and compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on transition-level SACCOs in a single country. An extension into other jurisdictions with nascent, transitional and mature SACCOs would provide greater insights into the impact of disclosure regulation. Further, the study uses a self-constructed disclosure checklist which is subject to coding errors and biases. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for SACCO regulators and accounting professional body to devise incentives to improve the level of compliance with required disclosures. Originality/value: The study contributes to the dearth of evidence on the efficacy of the introduction of mandatory disclosure requirements in a developing country where compliance is problematic because of difficulties with enforcement. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Women’s participation in political processes is important to address gender inequality and strengthen democracy. In Indian context, to empower women and enable political participation, 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) was introduced. Subsequently, many women entered politics. Though widespread proxy is reported, still a small proportion engages effectively in governmental participation (Hust, 2002; Mathew, 2003; Palanithurai, 2001). Studies also find female Dalit-headed panchayats are more active (Jayshree, 2010; Kalaiselvi, 2012). As the cultural norms, traditions and patriarchy are rigid, the paper attempts to examine what helps the women to be functional? Does social networks differ? Is there a link between social capital, by way of associationalism, and capacity for self governance as suggested by Putnam (1993) in the Indian context? Social capital is understood through social networks and membership in associations. Thirty-eight elected representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions of southern Tamil Nadu, south India was interviewed in depth. Active members prominently belong to Dalit community and the social network of the elected active members is larger in size, heterogeneous in terms of age, gender and caste composition, and they are anchors themselves. They are primarily embedded in a web of political, caste and self-help group associations and have access to all women police stations, cooperative societies and political parties through family ties. The elected representative’s mandatory membership in district Dalit federations provides safety-net in dealing with discrimination and atrocities while also intervening at the village-level panchayat. Dalit women who have the capacity to mobilize social capital emerge efficient in local self governance. © 2018 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.},

It also identifies the following roles of the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JAs) and the specialist wholesaler as innovation intermediaries to: (1) develop new farming materials such as fertilizers, (2) translate and deliver practical farming knowledge for farmers and (3) establish the market of environmental-friendly rice. Statistical analysis uncovers that farmers more appreciated the supports from the JAs than those from other intermediaries to participate in the schemes. Complemented by the innovation journey analysis, our findings suggest that the keys to increasing farmers’ participation in the schemes include a clear vision and economic incentives for farmers as well as the coordination among intermediaries who have different expertise. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Drawing on qualitative research on two Mondragon multinational co-ops based on longitudinal data and in-depth interviews, we address the dilemmas raised by the multinationalization of co-ops through the establishment of subsidiaries abroad, and show the tensions surrounding the ‘cooperativization’ of foreign subsidiaries, that is to say, the reproduction of the cooperative organizational formula and the transfer of its idiosyncratic policies and practices to foreign subsidiaries. The main finding of the research is that, behind the instrumentalization of various institutional barriers by the managerial technostructure of the parent co-ops to justify the non-cooperativization of foreign subsidiaries, lie factors stemming from headquarters-subsidiary power relations, as well as from core co-op owner-members looking to protect their own interests. Indeed, a clear dissociation has been found between the Mondragon corporate discourse about the promotion of participation and democracy overseas, and the real practices that are operational within the foreign subsidiaries. The article also draws some practical implications for multinational co-ops wishing to extend the cooperative model to their overseas subsidiaries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In Israel, that decline accelerated after the mid-1980s of the last century. However, the proportion of rural households in Israel has declined less than in France, which this study uses for comparison. The small size of Israel has allowed young families to inhabit the countryside while working in nearby cities. Such rural urbanization has not happened in Israel’s periphery, such as the Eshkol region (western Negev), where bad public transportation makes it harder to commute to Beer Sheva or Tel Aviv. Nowadays, low birth rate, ageing population and progressive depopulation characterize the Eshkol region.

    abstract = {Japan's agricultural support and protection regime appears as a particularly persistent relict of the country's postwar political economy. Yet, it is also by no means static. This article frames the trajectory of Japan's agricultural support and protection regime as a process of gradual endogenous institutional change. The pace and direction of this process are not only determined on the macro level, but also in the 'local'. To illustrate this argument, the article traces the local origins of recent policies toward farmland consolidation surrounding a major revision of the Agricultural Land Law in 2009. This revision deregulated corporate farmland access, but also prepared the ground for a new approach to public farmland allocation to expanding farms. The latter was sourced from certain local farmland governance models. At a closer look, these local models are not only 'best practices' to achieve farmland consolidation, but also reflect the 'defensive' interests of the incumbent local stakeholders of the postwar agricultural support and protection regime, such as the local branches of JA, the powerful organization of agricultural cooperatives. More generally, the article proposes to understand localnational policy transfers as a mode of endogenous institutional change. © The Author 2017.

We interviewed administrators at twenty Costa Rican coffee cooperatives about management practices related to voluntary certification. Voluntary certifications are popular among coffee cooperatives. Access to certified markets is facilitated by state support of the cooperative sector, regulation of the coffee sector and well-enforced environmental and social laws. However, there are no significant or consistent financial incentives for farmers to pursue certification. Multiple certifications may lower auditing and implementation costs, but cooperatives rarely receive the full premium for multiply-certified coffee. Low market demand for certified coffee, weak price incentives and high auditing and management costs encourage cooperatives to certify only a portion of their members. This strategy rewards compliant farmers rather than inducing widespread change to farming practices among the entire membership. Though financial incentives are weak, certifications offer non-financial benefits to both farmers and cooperatives, including better management and more resilient cooperatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {The recent international financial crisis exposed many of the frailties that exist within the European banking sector. One major decision taken by the European Commission was to transition the powers of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors to that of the European Banking Authority (EBA). Our analysis focuses primarily on the differing behaviour by each European country's banking sector to major shocks, namely that in the form of bank closures. It is then necessary to investigate and further understand the role that the European Banking Authority now possesses with regards to releasing sensitive announcements based on the underlying currents of the European Banking system as measured by domestic banking sector stock returns. Finally, we investigate the cultural characteristics that can be uncovered by analysing the responses of domestic banking sectors to uniform regulation. We present three key findings. First, European countries with more local banking networks in the form of credit unions, public banks or savings banks, generate greater levels of volatility when compared to that of their commercial counterparts, particularly in countries with more monopolistic sectors. Secondly, the announcements of the European Banking Authority generate significant volatility effects for the European banking sector at large, with particular emphasis on stress testing results, but also announcements based on recapitalisation, regulation and transparency. Finally, cultural distance effects are identified, indicating that peripheral states are experiencing more substantial volatility effects to European Banking Authority decisions. These results indicate that uniformity of regulation may in fact be hindering and restricting the growth of some domestic and more peripheral and locally designed banking sectors in the form of rules designed for commercial banking operations. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {Working with farmers' groups, associations and cooperatives constitutes a fundamental element of extension work with family farmers. Despite the fact that extension practitioners face many problems in this area of their work, there is currently a lack of academic literature that systematically addresses the topic and offers concrete guidelines for practice. Thus, this paper will aim to clarify the benefits of farmers' groups, associations and networks within the context of family farming, systematise problems faced by rural extensionists when working with farmers' groups and associations, provide conceptual tools for understanding group and associative processes, and construct a set of guidelines and recommendations for facing said problems. In order to achieve these aims, the authors conducted an extensive literature review and drew upon their personal experience on the topic. Results suggest that some of the benefits of associative work are: better access to inputs, produce and credit markets, the facilitation of learning processes, the empowerment of family farmers as social actors, and a reduction of rural extension costs. Additionally, with respects to the problems faced by extensionists, the following can be highlighted: individualist attitudes and conflicts between farmers, scarce participation and commitment, problems with leaderships and with organisations' administrative management, and the lack of extensionists' training to address these processes, among others. With regards to the factors that increase trust and cooperation are: interpersonal communication and mutual knowledge, sharing problems, values and objectives, and the existence of shared rules for the functioning of the group that include sanctions for transgressors. In this context, the extensionists' role will be that of facilitating processes of construction of group relationships, creating rules for the groups' functioning and developing the group's capacities for self-management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {As land and wealth are increasingly concentrated in North America, grassroots organizations are calling into question longstanding norms about the relationships between private property, sustainable agriculture, land governance institutions, and ongoing processes of agrarian transformation. In response to challenges faced by new entrants to agriculture in accessing farmland oriented towards localized and alternative food systems, advocates for farmland protection and cooperative land access point to the potential for community-based land reform to support sustainable land use while promoting social and political equity – areas where they argue an economic system based on individual ownership of farmland has failed. Based on the principles of “new agrarianism,” community-based farmland access initiatives are experimenting with new forms and practices of cooperative and shared land tenure, as an alternative to a state-led model of redistributive land reform based on individual property rights. We analyze here the results of a participatory research project conducted with a cooperative and community-based land trust and land access program in British Columbia, Canada. We assess the efficacy of the community farms program as a potential mechanism to spark a new phase of agrarian transition that can reverse farmland consolidation and support socially and ecologically embedded land relations, as a structural context for food sovereignty in North America. Specifically, we argue that the community foodlands trust movement can be viewed an insurgent – but fundamentally constrained – “people's enclosure” within a corporate land regime. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Concessional bargaining in day-to-day interactions generates goodwill, which helps smoothen future dealings amongst farmers as well as with outside agents. In particular, we model the existence of goodwill amongst farmers as enhancing their ability to collectively bargain with an outside dealer that buys their farm produce. Results suggest that when dealing with each other, farmers offer higher concessions when the risk of loss or reversal in bargaining power is high; however, the level of concession is also influenced by the degree of reciprocity and parameters that affect bargaining surplus. Findings provide further insights over the success of cooperative institutions in rural farm settings where inter-farmer goodwill dynamics determines the cooperative's bargaining outcomes. Specifically, when farmers generously reciprocate each other's goodwill gestures, it leads to better outcomes through increasing their cooperative reservation price. In contrast, when the degree of reciprocity is lower, or when the risk of bargaining power switching is higher, farmers extract more surplus from other farmers, and this also lowers the cooperative's bargaining outcomes and makes the cooperative arrangement unviable in the long term. © 2017 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2017 CIRIEC},

    abstract = {There is growing concern that Agri-environment Schemes (AESs) may not be effective in conserving the countryside. Particular concern has arisen around whether the current approach of individual, farm-level, AES agreements are sufficient to offer landscape-scale environmental protection and enhancement. Whilst recent additions to AESs have sought to encourage more joined-up thinking by offering payments to farmers to form collective agreements, uptake is low and there is very little known about farmers’ (non)resistance to such collective conservation. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research with 74 farms across 5 sites in the UK, this paper provides new data on the barriers to farmers’ uptake of collective AESs and offers a new formulation of how we understand farming cooperation. The paper advances Bourdieusian-inspired ideas of the cultural construct of ‘good farming’ by synthesising these with recent reconceptualizations of ‘trust’ in order to provide a more contextually grounded and temporally-inflected understanding of farmers’ cooperative activities. The findings reveal that whilst working relations between farmers are often collegiate, and in places collective, several watershed events over past decades have led to a shift from community-level to process-based (peer-to-peer) trust and a move toward land management being depicted as a squarely individual rather than collective issue. Conceptually, the paper moves beyond the current limitation of viewing trust, and the associated development of social capital – seen as a prerequisite for more collective AESs – as cumulative and one-directional to highlighting their multiple, issue-specific, nature which may become eroded and (re)developed over time. Alongside this, the paper offers a new way of understanding the good farmer by shifting the focus from the individual farm/farmer level to a more fine-grained and contextualised issue-centered notion of good farming. This is then used to explain the seeming reluctance of land holders, evidenced in official statistics, to engage in collective AESs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {After the abolition of milk quotas in Switzerland, dairy farmers had to reorganise. New farmers' organisations emerged and traditional co-operatives had to search for strategies at multiple levels (markets, membership, services provision, and diversification) to strengthen their position. In this ethnographic study, we analyse three central co-operative values – democracy, solidarity, autonomy – and their translation and development within the adaptation strategies developed by five farmers' organisations. Despite the many challenges to co-operative values related to a context of market deregulation, the new strategies developed demonstrate the continued importance and rejuvenation of these co-operative values as narratives and practices. In addition, results show a blurring of boundaries between organisations of different kinds (specifically co-operatives and public limited companies) and overlaps in the strategies employed by both (including new forms of collaboration and marketing). Whilst these emerging forms, and the associated strategies and values embodied, could be read as the hybridization of a traditional co-operative approach, we argue that the concept of hybridity unduly polarises co-operatives and corporates in a way that does not acknowledge the implicit plurality of motivations and behaviours in all forms of business structure. Consequently, the paper argues that looking at the practices of co-operation, beyond rigid categories, helps to understand better how co-operative values are actually enacted within farmers' organisations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {The supervision and audit of agricultural cooperatives in Greece are neither defined nor used with a clear content in the Greek legal texts. Nevertheless, it has been argued that supervision is mainly associated with broad monitoring duties, including advice and guidance, whereas audit is usually limited to a financial and legal control of the enterprise. The aforementioned institutions have not been adequately prescribed by law and effectively applied in practice, in order to address the cooperatives’ needs and protect the members’, the minority’s and the public interest. The recent legal reforms, since the outbreak of the crisis, brought to the fore the topic of cooperative supervision and audit. Thus, a question is posed of whether they have been a positive step forward. The present article, therefore, aiming to analyze relevant past and recent laws, concluded that despite minor innovations the shortcoming of the above institutions are yet to be resolved. Thus, a politically independent supervisory authority, a cooperative-oriented audit examining the cooperative’s impact to its members, the environment and the local community, as well as the formation of a scientific committee to monitor the cooperative laws’ implementation are suggested as necessary changes for the improvement of the existing regime. © 2018, European Business Law Review.

    abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is one of the serious international environmental issues that can lead to severe damages such as climate change, sea level rise, emerging disease and many other impacts. Rice cultivation is associated with emissions of potent GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide. Thai rice has been massively exported worldwide however the markets are becoming more competitive than ever since the green market has been hugely promoted. In order to maintain the same level or enhance of competitiveness, Thai rice needs to be considered for environmentally conscious products to meet the international environmental standards. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of rice production in order to identify the major emission sources and possible reduction strategies. In this research, the rice variety considered is Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105) cultivated by organic practices. The data sources were Don-Chiang Organic Agricultural Cooperative (DCOAC), Mae-teang district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand and the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) of Thailand with onsite records and interviews of farmers in 2013. The GHG emissions were calculated from cradle-to-farm by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and the 2006 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The functional unit is defined as 1 kg of paddy rice at farm gate. Results showed that the total GHG emissions of organic rice production were 0.58 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice. The major source of GHG emission was from the field emissions accounting for 0.48 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice, about 83% of total, followed by land preparation, harvesting and other stages (planting, cultivation and transport of raw materials) were 9, 5 and 3% of total, respectively. The comparative results clearly showed that the GHG emissions of organic paddy rice were considerably lower than conventional rice production due to the advantages of using organic fertilisers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using cellphone technology as a training tool on smallholder dairy farms (SDFs) in Kenya. This field trial was carried out between June and September 2017 on 40 farms randomly selected from members of the Naari Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society in Naari sub-location of Meru County, Kenya. An abridged dairy management handbook, developed by Farmers Helping Farmers and the University of Prince Edward Island, was translated into the local dialect, and disseminated as short message text. After pre-intervention knowledge and attitudes assessments on dairy management, farms were randomly allocated into intervention and comparison groups. Using an online short message service interface (because the study population all had cell phones but only 1.7% had smart phones), short messages on management practices were sent daily, for 3 months, to the phones owned by the farmers in the intervention group. Post-intervention assessment of dairy management knowledge and attitudes related to the messages was done 3 weeks post-intervention. Within and between group comparisons and net changes were determined using t-tests, Chi-squared tests where applicable. There were no significant demographic or knowledge differences between the two groups pre-intervention. Compared to pre-intervention, trained farmers in the intervention group were significantly more informed on: mastitis prevention, disease (calf diarrhea) prevention, stall management, the role of a balanced nutritious diet on immunity and the resolution of some health conditions post-intervention. Translation of message content to the local language and using easily understandable terminology were reported to be helpful for better understanding and motivation of farmers to implement recommendations. Cellphone technology with a short message service interface can be an effective training tool for SDFs in remote areas of Kenya located far from where seminars are conducted for dairy farmers. © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

    abstract = {In 2007, leading members of the U.S. fresh-tomato industry responded to pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding the industry's long history of poor food-safety outcomes and adopted a set of standards for production practices related to food safety at all levels of the fresh-tomato supply chain. Adherence to these standards was required under a federal marketing order that applied to essentially all tomatoes grown in Florida. The California Tomato Farmers cooperative, whose members produced the vast majority of fresh tomatoes grown in California, also required that its members adopt these standards. The collective food-safety standards for fresh tomatoes closely resemble the requirements of the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule, so the collective adoption of these standards provides an excellent case study to illustrate the possible effects of FSMA implementation on demand. I assess the hypothesis that demand for tomatoes from Florida and California increased following the adoption of standards for food-safety practices by growers in those states, relative to demand for tomatoes from other regions. My analysis demonstrates essentially no evidence that demand for fresh tomatoes responded positively to the implementation of collective food-safety practices. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

    abstract = {Significant scale economies have been recently cited to rationalize a dramatic growth in the US retail credit union sector over the past few decades. In this paper, we explore another plausible supply-side explanation for the growth of the industry, namely economies of diversification. We focus on the fact that credit unions differ among themselves in the range of financial services they offer to their members. Since larger credit unions tend to offer a more diversified financial service menu than credit unions of a smaller size, the incentive to grow in size may be fueled not only by present scale economies but also by economies of diversification. This paper provides the first robust estimates of such economies of diversification for the credit union sector. We estimate a flexible semiparametric smooth coefficient quantile panel data model with correlated effects that is capable of accommodating a four-way heterogeneity among credit unions. Our results indicate the presence of non-negligible economies of diversification in the industry. We find that as many as 27–91% (depending on the type and the cost quantile) of diversified credit unions enjoy substantial economies of diversification; the cost of most remaining credit unions is invariant to the scope of services. We also find overwhelming evidence of increasing returns to scale in the industry. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This study examines Shari’ah governance (SG) arrangements within the cooperatives in Malaysia. The objectives of this paper are to explore the application of SG in the cooperative sector in Malaysia and to evaluate the adequacy of SG adoption in cooperative. This study uses qualitative methods where the data are collected using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with regulators, experts, and the governance organs of the cooperatives. The study focuses on credit cooperatives that have been listed in the 100 Best Cooperative Directory issued by Suruhanjaya Koperasi Malaysia (SKM) annually from 2012 to 2016. The findings from thematic analysis on interviews conducted indicate that the first objective, most respondents agreed that cooperatives should be operated based on the objectives of its establishment. The findings on the adequacy of adoption of SG in Shari’ah-compliant cooperatives indicate that the practice is at an infancy stage, with plenty of support and motivation are needed to ensure effective and efficient implementation of SG. Emergent findings from the interviews reveal that the Islamic attributes are crucial for a cooperative’s SG organs such as Islamic accountability, Shari’ah mindset, Islamic culture, awareness and readiness, manpower competencies and cooperation (ta'awun). It is vital for the SG organs to have such attributes in order to foster awareness among them to be more responsible and willing to adopt good SG practices. The observation of good SG practices in the cooperative sector in Malaysia can help the cooperative movement to positively grow and contribute equitably to community. © International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM).},

Value co-creation, professionalization of management, satisfaction and loyalty, and long-term time orientation of the member were measured based on the member’s perception. The results demonstrate a significant association between satisfaction and loyalty and perception of value co-creation and a positive association between the long-term time horizon and the perception of value co-creation actions. In other words, perception of the benefits generated by the actions of the cooperative can be influenced by time orientation and level of satisfaction and loyalty.

For the development of agricultural cooperation system have been developed possible options for combining agricultural commodity producers, a mechanism for the formation and functioning of perspective models of agricultural cooperatives in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The recommended model for the creation of a cooperative for the livestock fattening and slaughtering in the practical activities of livestock farms will contribute to stabilization of the economy of sector, including an increase in amount of livestock, the production of meat and milk. The model for the creation the cooperative on chicken cultivation and production of poultry meat is one of the most urgent and promising directions for the development of agrarian and industrial complex. In this regard, it is recommended to create the cooperative by combining the population farms with the aim of building an incubator, a mini feed mill, a slaughterhouse, chicken growing house and further selling poultry to the trade network. In order to improve the breeding value and composition of the main herd for producing sheep products and wool oriented for the export and further distributing them recommended model of cooperative on sheep breeding and wool production. The necessity of creating a cooperative oriented for the primary processing of agricultural products by installing a milk receiving point of milk, which gives a significant economic effect to the country's agriculture, is substantiated. With the aim of increasing the effectiveness of the process of cooperating small forms of management and the stable functioning of the established agricultural cooperatives, the necessity of elaborating a Concept for the Development of Agricultural Cooperatives in the Republic of Kazakhstan is justified; also formulated purpose, main tasks, expected results and the mechanism for its implementation. © 2018.},

In Ethiopia, a partnership between a domestic trading firm and a cooperative union has helped enhancing capabilities at the supply-base as well as strengthening the cooperative's internal governance, managerial capabilities, and financial and non-financial resources. Based on in-depth interviews, our paper presents a case study on how this partnership operates. Good technical assistance provided by the union, with support from the exporting company and an NGO, is one of the key success factors of this partnership.

We analyze the importance of the Basel III additional capital buffer requirements for credit union prudential regulation. Based on a sample of the 100 largest credit unions in Canada from 1996 to 2014, we find that Canadian credit union capital buffers behave countercyclically over the business cycle. Further, credit unions hold a capital buffer bigger than the maximum buffer advocated under Basel III which is 5% of risk-weighted assets (RWA). These results suggest that, unlike commercial banks worldwide, credit unions, by and large, are already in compliance with the new Basel III buffer requirements. However, there is evidence that the capital buffers of low-capitalized credit unions are procyclical. These credit unions increased their RWA during booms but failed to build up additional capital accordingly. Hence, weakly capitalized credit unions are more likely to adjust their capital buffers if they are subject to Basel III capital buffer regulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

It analyzes the relationship between vertical and horizontal structures, and the economic sustainability of different structure combinations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a conceptual framework to predict coordination structures as a function of transaction-cost characteristics, compares predictions for the Malian cereals market to empirical evidence using 15 case studies, and then analyzes structure combinations. Findings: Asymmetric scale between farmers and buyers; uncertainty in production, prices, policy, and contract enforcement; and quality and quantity debasement lead to selections of structures with high levels of control. Vertical and horizontal structures demonstrate a complementary relationship in certain core coordination roles, while exhibiting substitutability in the provision of other coordination activities. The marketing cooperative and marketing contract pairing is the most prevalent combination. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual framework is useful for explaining the selection of coordination structures, and can be applied in other contexts to strengthen external validity. Originality/value: The framework facilitates predictions and explanation of both VC and HC structures, with empirical application on a country and value chains receiving little attention in the literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

After the collapse of many weakly performing monopolist organizations during the 1980s and 1990s, strengthened cooperatives have emerged since the 2000s. Scholarly knowledge about the state–cooperative relations in which this “revival” takes place remains poor. Based on new evidence from Uganda's coffee sector, this paper discusses the political economy of Africa's cooperative revival. The authors argue that donors' and African governments' renewed support is framed in largely apolitical terms, which obscures the contested political and economic nature of the revival. In the context of neoliberal restructuring processes, state and non-state institutional support to democratic economic organizations with substantial redistributional agendas remains insufficient. The political–economic context in Uganda—and potentially elsewhere in Africa—contributes to poor terms of trade for agricultural cooperatives while maintaining significant state control over some cooperative activities to protect the status quo interests of big capital and state elites. These conditions are unlikely to produce a conflict-free, substantial, and sustained revival of cooperatives, which the new promoters of cooperatives suggest is under way. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

    abstract = {Value chain of cashew has got greater potential in income generation and farm level employment. It was observed that increase in farm size is accompanied by higher productivity and remunerative price fetched by large farmers as compared to other categories of cashew growers. The net price received by the farmers was the highest when they sold their produce directly to consumers. The highest benefit cost ratio was achieved by the large farms because of judicious expenditure in cashew production and obtaining a sizeable amount of returns. In the West Garo Hills, cashew value chain needs application of modern technology and proper management practices for better production and marketing. The study highlight that the prospect of cashew value chain in Meghalaya is bright as the trend of other traditional crop production in the potential areas is quite encouraging for the organic cashew farming. There is enough scope for enhancing organic produce of cashew. Direct marketing of cashew produce always fetch good price for the producer but it is not possible for all categories of farmers. Therefore, formation of cooperative societies of cashew growers is suggested for marketing of various inputs as well as outputs of cashew produce. © Indian Society for Plantation Crops.

This paper is meant to analyse one example of the manifestation of development - in other words: economic - dualism: this is the spatial realisation of access or exclusion that can be experienced in case of credit institute activities. An important starting point for the issue is the business philosophy and operational distinction of Hungarian actors in the credit institute market (a segment of the representatives of global commercial banks and locally embedded savings cooperatives), and the analysis of the geographical range of their activities (Kovács, 2014a; 2017), and also the survey of their relationship to developed centre regions and lagging peripheral areas. I analysed this questions with the functional distance indicator, which is a relatively new approach of the financial proximity in the evaluations of the Hungarian banking sector. This indicator uses some social, economic and physical data for the explanation of dualities between commercial and cooperative banks. © 2018 Regional Science Association of Subotica (Drustvo za Regionalne Nauke).},

    abstract = {Many authors have proposed cooperatives as one of the preferred governance structures for realising alternative food systems, being recommended both in farming and also downstream at consumer level. However, recommendations for the cooperative model still draw dividing line between producer and consumer cooperatives. As opposed to conventional agricultural cooperatives (ACs) made up of farmer members only, the multi-stakeholder model brings together producers, consumers and/or restaurateurs under one single enterprise. This paper analyses multi-stakeholder cooperatives' (MSCs) potential to recreate more sustainable food flows between rural and urban areas and to overcome the limitations of conventional farmer cooperatives focused more on economic than social and environmental benefits. As part of this research, historical data from cooperative archives is used to look at the history and early attempts of multi-stakeholder cooperation in food and farming. Additionally, current supporting evidence from Spain and UK, in the context of European food policy frameworks, is also presented. A four-fold proposal for open cooperatives is discussed and applied to the analysis of the case studies in the framework of global transformative networks and alliances. The introduction of different types of members seems to both complicate and enrich the cooperative mission, both theoretically and in practice. Their networks with other social movements reveal how the MSCs presented are trying to change, rather than adapt to the market economies they struggle to survive in. The findings suggest MSCs in food and farming are striving to achieve more-than-economic benefits and are moving into the arena of the open and pro-commons economy and other global social movements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {With increased consolidation by food retailers and increased fragmentation of consumer preferences, product differentiation is of growing importance to food producers and manufacturers for sustainable competitiveness. While the marketplace is dominated by large corporations such as General Mills and Kraft Heinz, there exist few farmer cooperatives with well-known brands, which may imply its long-term viability is jeopardized. Therefore, this study analyzes trademark data of U.S. farmer cooperatives to better determine (i) which types of farmer cooperatives brand and (ii) how much farmer cooperatives brand relative to firms. Per the first negative binomial model, trademark ownership intensity is relatively high for marketing cooperatives in dairy, fruits and vegetables, nuts, and several other raw commodities. However, the second model indicates farmer cooperatives own 1086% fewer trademarks as compared to firms in the same sectors. U.S. farmer cooperatives thus have relatively weak brand equity. To spur future competitiveness by means of branding, farmer cooperatives may improve product quality, adapt ownership structure characteristics to facilitate member investment in long-term growth opportunities, use strategic arrangements to assign control of non-member business to decision specialists, form common agencies with other farmer cooperatives, or use family-based or origin-based connotations to raise consumer willingness-to-pay. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach – The method adopted was the Classic Linear Regression Model with Panel Data, estimated by Feasible Generalized Least Squares for fixed effects and corrections for heteroscedasticity. The sample was made up of 113 credit unions affiliated to UNICRED systems, over the 2001-2011 period, and data was made available by Central Bank of Brazil. Findings – The analysis, carried out through non-discretionary results on credit operations in order to explain the changes in net expenses of provision on credit operations, indicated there was smoothing of results. Thus, we can infer that the credit unions affiliated to UNICRED make use of earnings management in the income smoothing modality. Originality/value – This study contributes to the issue of Accounting Results Management, and corroborates that there are indications that, in the occurrence of higher non-discretionary results, credit unions tend to maximize provisions. Similarly, in the occurrence of lower non-discretionary results, they tend to minimize provisions, making evident the search for smaller variability in results, thus signaling mitigation of risks. © FECAP.},

Ninety artisanal fishermen were selected using two-stage sampling techniques. Questionnaire and interview schedule was used to get information. The research objectives were analyzed using frequency, percentages and mean. On the socio-economics characteristics of the artisanal fishermen, it was found that the majority (58%) of the respondents were male with 36% of the respondents having secondary school as their highest level of education. Also 31% have fishing experience of below10 years with yearly fish output of above 1000kg by 31% of the respondents and yearly income of greater than N200,000 by 53% of the respondents while 81% belong to co-operative society. Extension agents have visited none of the respondents. The major environmental factors affecting artisanal fishing in the area were oil spillage (100%), waste disposal (100%) and climatic factors (100%). On the constraints faced, the study found out that militant activities, inadequate finance, oil spillage around depots, and poor sales were found to be serious. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that, the Government and other appropriate authorities should enforce the fishing laws and regulations to avoid illegal exploitation of fishing grounds by trawlers and the destruction of artisanal fishing gears. Also, better access to relevant information should be enhanced by making extension services available to fish farmers in the various depots. © 2018 Agricultural Extension Society of Nigeria.},

The perception of farmers was important to build relationships with nature during the implementation and management of agroforestry systems (AFS), however, more work needs to be done in order to better understand this perception. For this purpose, quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied, interviews with semi-structured scripts were carried out, crosscut walks in rural areas with direct observation and annotations were done in a field diary. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics in the SPSS 19.0 program. The farmers' perceptions about AFS are distinct. The environmental feature is considered by smallholders due to their historical-cultural view of systems management and the necessity for shadowing and valorization of ecosystem services. The commercial concerns are more relevant to agrobusiness farmers It is worth noting that, in view of the analysis, the support of CAMTA (Mixed Agricultural Cooperative of Tomé-Açu), APPRAFAMTA (Association of Rural Producers and Producers of Family Agriculture of Tomé-Açu) and educational and research institutions is important in the dissemination of information and the exchange of experiences for the agroecological transition.},

In this paper, we analyse the CSR activities of the regional co-operatives of the leading Finnish retailer S Group based on annual board reporting. In light of our findings, we argue that no consistently high level of CSR can be identified across the S Group and all its regional co-operatives. Therefore, we do not deem it feasible to conclude that consumer co-operatives are inherently socially responsible organizations merely due to their organization form. Instead, it seems that the fact that the members are in charge in a consumer co-operative and elect a board to oversee it serves to keep the responsibility in the hands of local residents, but at the same time, it also requires a genuine interest towards governance of the co-operative as well as CSR issues. In the absence of either, the level of responsibility is likely to depend on the interest management and board members show in these issues. The paper concludes with practical implications for the S Group and consumer co-operatives in general as well future avenues for research on CSR and consumer co-operatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Factors affecting the adoption of double cropping were explored in rice farms of Fouman County of Guilan Province in northern Iran using artificial neural networks (ANNs), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LGR). Eleven factors (age, education, occupation, family size, type of farm ownership, distance to the agricultural service center, attending agricultural extension courses, use of financial resources and bank loans, number of domestic animals, area under cultivation, and social participation) were examined. An additional objective was to compare the ability of the three models in predicting the adoption of double cropping. ANNs showed an overall predictive power of 89.8%. LDA showed an overall predictive power of 83.2%, with seven of the eleven independent variables being effective on the adoption of double cropping. LGR indicated an overall predictive power of 87.6%, with eight of the eleven independent variables being effective on the adoption of double-rice cropping. ANNs showed higher power than LGR and LDA in predicting the adoption of double cropping. Based on all three methods used for analysis, the most important independent variables were social participation and area under cultivation (positive factors) as well as distance to the agricultural service center and family members (negative factors). Establishment of cooperatives or other kinds of farmers’ associations to foster social participation could motivate adoption of double cropping, particularly among small-scale farmers. To increase agricultural services, more local centers should be created in rural areas. The government should promote double cropping through effective incentives and technology transfer to small-scale farmers. © 2017, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan KK.},

    abstract = {The expansion of global seafood trade creates opportunities as well as risks for small-scale fisheries (SSFs) livelihoods. Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucatán, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16 months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron–client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron–client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron–client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world's SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-à-vis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

To explore the Bristol Pound's impact on localisation, 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with businesses and other Bristol Pound stakeholders. Economists were also interviewed to gain insights into the barriers to localisation and the likely impact of a CLC on these barriers. Overall, our findings suggest that the Bristol Pound is not driving localisation. Many of the key barriers were found to be political/institutional in nature (e.g. support for free trade, the free movement of capital, the power of global corporations, and the expansionary logic of capitalism). Such barriers are unlikely to be influenced by a CLC. We therefore suggest that those pursuing localisation should engage in a more active agenda that aims to change government policy and institutions to support an equitable, sustainable economy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {Under the so-called ‘de-involution’ of the young leaving and women and elderly left behind in the countryside, how can the Chinese rural sector accomplish a structural transition and achieve large-scale agricultural production? This is the issue to be discussed in this paper. The conventional understanding is that large-scale production is about land concentration and scale management through agricultural businesses, family farms, or agricultural cooperatives. In our view, given the unfavorable Chinese land/people ratio, any attempt to eliminate household-based, small-scale farming is bound to fail. This study suggests that a paradigm shift is needed from ‘Scale Management’ to ‘Scale Service.’ Today’s agricultural production is no longer a ‘Pole-like Straight Way’ model. Different stages and processes of production have their own unique characteristics and functions. With the advancement of agricultural technology and the marketization of production factors, agricultural service has needed to catch up in scale. However, this development does not have to be based on land concentration and the elimination of household farming. On the contrary, it can be done through local social networks. Local social networks can significantly reduce the organizational costs of large-scale services without changing the current household-based small farming community structure. This will bring about a new system of ‘Agricultural Business Management’ that can both improve production efficiency and protect small farmers’ livelihoods. Such a model is a combination of tradition and market. It should play an important role in the rural reconstruction and urbanization of central and western China. © The Author(s) 2017.},

    abstract = {In 2011, the Guidelines for Economic and Social Policy of the Party and the Revolution announced Cuba's intentions to decentralize state power and economic decision-making, shift toward a mixed economy, and channel up to one-third of state workers to worker-owned cooperative enterprises and the small business sector. As socialist theory requires movement away from state-centered and toward mixed economies, I examine Danish and Cuban cooperative agricultural movements, evaluating them with respect to the Rochdale Principles of cooperative production, to identify appropriate economic production forms for democratic, participatory socialism within the context of globalization. This study argues first that, to maximize efficiency, cooperative production processes must remain entirely in the hands of cooperative federations. Second, a culture of economic democracy is reinforced by the democratic principles of cooperative work. Third, an income tax would function as a more appropriate way for the Cuban state to obtain a share of returns from agricultural cooperatives than the current production quota system, to avoid disrupting cooperative incentive structures. Fourth, cooperatives can perform well in any industry, at all levels of technological development, and should be considered a dominant model for socialism. Finally, although the Rochdale Principles are based on economic and social justice, these principles and their practical application must be continually refined through further experimentation and research. © 2017 Institute for Human Geography.},

    abstract = {Despite the vast research on contract farming by agrarian scholars, little is known about interactions between biological risks and the social–political effects of contracts. This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and biological risks are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision-makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease. © 2017 The Authors.

    abstract = {Purpose: In Kenya, an award for reporting excellence is presented annually to the entities in the public and private sector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the characteristics of savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) that apply for the annual reporting excellence award in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs correlation and probit regression analyses to establish the factors which explain the decision by SACCOs to participate in the Financial Reporting (FIRE) excellence award. The study utilizes data consisting of 1,272 firm-year observations for 212 SACCOs, over the period 2008-2013. Findings: Consistent with institutional and legitimacy theories, the results demonstrate that structural and governance variables are significant and positively associated with the decision to participate in the annual FIRE awards by SACCOs in Kenya. Similarly, larger SACCOs and those that have adopted best cooperative governance practices are more likely to participate in the annual FIRE awards. The results also reveal that SACCOs audited by the Big 4 audit firms are more likely to participate in the annual FIRE awards. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the factors explaining the decision to participate in the annual reporting excellence awards by organizations in a specific sector. Further studies can adopt a multi-sectoral approach to investigate the same phenomenon. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of cooperative governance and resources in explaining why SACCOs choose to participate in the FIRE awards. Originality/value: The study adds onto the dearth of literature on the aspect under focus. Globally, very few studies have examined the drivers of the decision to participate in reporting excellence awards by organizations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results showed that 65.68% of the differences were caused by individual-level factors, and 34.32% were caused by provincial-level factors. The factors at the individual level, including the improvement of production equipment (IPE), education of farmers (EOF), regularization of management rules (RMR), and difficulty level of getting loans (DLL), had positive effects on growth of family farm, whereas the frequency of staff participating in training (FST) had a negative effect. At provincial level, improvement of the support policy system (IDSPS) could strengthen the positive correlation between RMR and growth of family farm. Moreover, the factor IDSPS combined with ability of agricultural cooperatives providing social services (AACPS) and spacious degree of technology access channel (SDTAC) could strengthen the positive correlation between EOF and growth of family farm, and reduced the negative correlation between FST and dependent variable. The results suggested that government should support farms to improve production equipment and financing pattern, transfer the method of re-education of grain family farmers, promote the standardization of grain family farms, establish a sound policy support system, improve the social service ability of agricultural cooperatives, and broaden the channels of technology acquisition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Purpose: A financial perspective of farmer cooperative performance is assumed by conceptualizing the cooperative as an independent firm. The purpose of this paper is to explore variability in the financial performance of the largest 1,000 US farmer cooperatives with emphasis on efficiency, productivity, and leverage. Design/methodology/approach: Cooperative performance is analyzed by means of the extended DuPont identity, an accounting tool which decomposes return on equity into five ratios of efficiency, productivity, and leverage. The extended DuPont identity is applied empirically with quantile regression, which allows estimation of the statistical interrelationship of the DuPont components across the full response distribution. Findings: Per the results, variability in the financial performance of US farmer cooperatives is for the most part associated with the operating profit margin, which confirms prior findings of cost inefficiency in the empirical literature. Therefore, US farmer cooperatives may improve financial performance by emphasizing sales and operating costs. Specifically, recommendations include placing emphasis on bargaining power, product differentiation, and scale economies. Supply cooperatives may also consider issuing non-qualified equity and securing long-term debt access as additional possibilities to improve financial performance. Originality/value: The empirical application of the extended DuPont identity with quantile regression facilitates a novel investigation of cooperative performance by placing emphasis on the efficiency, productivity, and leverage of cooperatives with various degrees of performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {While the introduction of agro-chemicals has had positive effects on rice productivity, its application has also caused environmental pollution and biodiversity losses. To reduce the pollution, the Vietnamese government has implemented several programs to encourage eco-friendly cultivation practices to discourage the overuse of agro-chemicals. However, farmers in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta have resisted the adoption of these eco-friendly practices. The current study aimed at investigating the factors affecting the adoption of eco-friendly rice production practices. We conducted structured interviews with 202 rice farmers. Analysis using generalized ordered logit regression produced evidence that membership in agricultural cooperatives or clubs, perception of biodiversity losses, perceived ease of use, farmer experience, and the perceived difference in selling price all had positive effects on adoption, while risk perception and the number of paddy plots negatively affected the adoption. We also found that the single eco practice (adoption of one eco-friendly practice in rice farming) had the highest economic achievement. One more interesting finding is that a large proportion of farmers who use conventional methods shared similar characteristics with eco rice farmers. Based on the results, to promote the adoption of eco practices, it is necessary to create an incentive mechanism to encourage farmers to join farmer organizations. In addition, policy makers should focus on informing farmers about mitigating risks such as adverse climatic impacts, polluted water, and other environmental threats. Technical training courses and other information-sharing meetings should also be required to introduce to farmers about the benefits of eco practices. © 2018 The Author(s).

    abstract = {The sharp increase in the price and production of quinoa between 1990 and 2014 has had important impacts in Bolivia’s southern Altiplano region, previously considered one of the poorest regions in the country. The socio-economic status of most inhabitants improved significantly as a result of the “quinoa boom”. However, it also caused severe disturbances in socio-ecological systems and posed challenges to resource governance by traditional indigenous institutions. This article focuses on the role of farmer cooperatives, in particular, and examines how their production rules may have mitigated some of the challenges associated with the quinoa boom. We assess the activities of cooperatives with the help of Elinor Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and analytic tools such as the ADICO grammar (Attribute, Deontic, aIm, Condition, Or else) and the eight design principles. The key production rules of cooperatives are examined and compliance with these rules is estimated based on semi-structured interviews and a survey conducted with quinoa producers (n=305). We argue that the cooperatives successfully contributed to alleviate pressures on resources in a context where traditional authorities were challenged by new tasks associated with land grabbing and the crowding out of diversified agricultural activities. In conclusion, we argue that collaboration between traditional authorities and farmer cooperatives holds great potential for improving the governance and sustainability of socio-ecological systems in the region. © 2018, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

The climate will continue to evolve as discussed in all IPCC reports and there is a need for farmers, seed companies and agricultural cooperative corporations to be able to anticipate those changes. The ambition of our work is to provide them with the means to get ready to adapt by analyzing a) the time evolution of meteorological stresses and certain management practices throughout the crop's growth cycle, b) the impacts of climate-induced changes in calculated sowing dates on those stresses and practices. We have applied the method we developed in a former paper to study the climatic suitability of maize in two contrasted areas of France, Ile-de-France in the North and Midi-Pyrénées in the South. Three climate change scenarios, two climate models and two maize varieties distinct in terms of precocity were used to try and ensure meaningful results. Whatever the scenario, model and variety, maize will be sown earlier than it is currently the case in both regions, especially in Midi-Pyrénées. Whatever the sowing date, rising temperatures in the future will be favorable for late varieties in the current cooler areas, and therefore even farmers in Ile-de-France will be able to grow varieties with a wide range of crop cycle length. However heat and water stress will increase in both regions between flowering and maturity, irrespective of the sowing date and scenario, thereby limiting the possibility to achieve potential yields. In Midi-Pyrénées compromises will need to be found between early sowing to minimize some later stress and increasing risks of frost during emergence, that do not currently exist. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

It provides quasi-experimental evidence of the impact of membership of an agricultural co-operative on women's capabilities, their power and ability to influence decisions, and intra-household productive and reproductive labour divisions. It uses the P'KWI Farmer to Farmer Co-operative Society in north-eastern Uganda as a case study. It shows that being a member of P'KWI has a significantly positive impact on economic wellbeing, knowledge and adoption of agronomic practices, especially among women. Co-operative membership has a particularly strong positive impact on women's decision making power at the household, group and community levels. Intra-household domestic and farm related labour divisions, however, did not change as a result of co-operative membership and remain disadvantageous for women.

    abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate dairy processors market power in Iran. For this purpose, the dynamic imperfect competition model, in which processors are allowed to exert market power in both downstream (selling dairy products) and upstream (buying raw milk from dairy farmers) was applied. Market power parameters, dairy products demand, and raw milk supply elasticities were jointly estimated in a system of equations including market margin, dairy demand, and raw milk supply equations by none linear estimation technique. Data for the period 1992 to 2012 on the industry level were used for estimating an empirical version of the model. The result indicated that conjectural elasticities values were a departure from zero, which reflected non-competitive behavior in dairy market and in raw milk market specifically. Among three dairy products including pasteurized milk, yogurt, and cheese, the conjectural elasticity was the highest for the pasteurized market and the lowest for yogurt. The result suggests that dairy industries processors exercise marketing power in the downstream and upstream market in the dairy products supply chain. Therefore, policymakers must make appropriate policy for facilitating entrance conditions for new dairy processors and improve farmers’ marketing cooperative so as to have more competitive raw milk price. © 2018, Tarbiat Modares University.

    abstract = {The Jewish Credit Cooperatives were an important manifestation (and tool) of Jewish self-assertion in the German economy rapidly dividing itself along racist fault lines even before the Nazis officially came to power in 1933. Based on files recently discovered in the course of his research on Jewish-owned businesses in Berlin, the author shows that the cooperatives came as part and parcel of a very efficient self-help system the Jewish community organized in 1933, which mainly granted microloans, thereby supporting businesses that would otherwise not have been able to borrow funds. The credit cooperatives filled an important gap and provided short-term credits for the rising number of Jewish self-employed in a more and more hostile surrounding in a country basically stripped of reserves. While the one cooperative went down in a crash in 1937, the other cooperative did business right until the pogrom if November 1938—which marked the beginning of the end of all commercial activity in Germany for Jews. © 2017.

    abstract = {Plant Clinics offer significant services to small-scale farmers in terms of crop protection advice in many developing countries, but research pertaining to the technical performance of Plant Clinics as providers of crop protection services is limited. The present study evaluated the performance of Plant Clinics in Guilan Province of northern Iran by data envelopment analysis (DEA). Data were collected through a structured questionnaire from paddy farmers and the executives of eighteen Plant Clinics in Guilan Province in northern Iran. Most Plant Clinics (61.1%) covered an area from 400 to 800 ha and most (83.3%) served up to 800 farmers, issuing between 1 and 50 prescriptions annually. The number of staff in the majority of Plant Clinics (55.6%) was between 5 and 10 people. Most Plant Clinics (55.6%) had an annual income between 150 and 250 million Iranian rials (IRR). Among 18 Plant Clinics studied, nine units had efficient performance, whereas the remaining showed inefficient operation. Efficient units tried more to absorb resources, to optimally allocate them, and to provide optimum services. Moreover, efficient units were more oriented towards clients' satisfaction and income promotion, which improved the units’ efficiency. Benchmarks were then determined for the inefficient Plant Clinics, so that the managers of those clinics can have insights into the status of those units compared with other Plant Clinics and try to fix their weaknesses and better exploit their strengths. Findings provide a framework for the evaluation of Plant Clinics as providers of crop protection services. Apart from local significance for improving the operation of Plant Clinics in Guilan Province, findings reveal critical points of intervention for improving Plant Clinics performance in other developing countries where these units operate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

    abstract = {Working together has proven to be beneficial for social, economic and regional development. Agricultural cooperatives, as a form of joint work, have appeared as a necessity of the economically burdened communities and then developed into strong and influential organizations that give social and economic stability in developed countries and offer hopes and solutions in developing countries. Yet, their development and popularisation has been hindered by several factors, including political regimes such as socialism, fascism or communism, which left many people with trust issues regarding this form of organisation. Recently, the agricultural cooperatives have caught wings among both authorities and farmers and spread all around the world and in all kind of fields. In this case, the author wanted to find out if the media has a role in this sudden popularization of a two hundred years old form of organization, and if there are any other implications for the media’s involvement. For this purpose, the linguistics borrowed discourse analysis methodology was used. The results show that media articles do not only have the role of spreading information, as one would assume, but a more important one. Since the media articles have a legislative and scientific base, with a familiar vocabulary, they turn out to be intermediaries, familiar interfaces between authorities and farmers, putting the policies into more accessible words. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

    abstract = {Recent research on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has rarely included empirical observation of how land managers perceive and respond to forest governance rules. In this case study, we consider how two decades of pilot projects for integrated conservation and sustainable development (ICDPs) variously influenced forest governance across three agrarian reform settlements in northwestern Mato Grosso state. The analysis combines: i) remote sensing of deforestation from 1997–2015; ii) land use and economic data for individual settler farms and cooperatives; iii) settlers' perceptions regarding legitimacy and relevance of state policies, including land use regulations under the Brazilian Forest Code. Deforestation across settlements varied in association with synergies – or lack thereof – between policy instruments and socially embedded rules organizing economic alternatives to the dominant regional pattern of cattle ranching. In two of the settlements deforestation surpassed or was approaching 80% of their total area. In the third settlement deforestation stabilized at 45%, corresponding with the initiation of ICDP support for a pilot project focused on Brazil nut extractivism to consolidate community management of the settlement's collective forest reserve. The latter process involved a ‘policy mix’ or sequence of overlapping components: technical assistance, cooperative organization, environmental licensing, infrastructure, equitable contracts with surrounding indigenous communities and market development. Comparing with the two counterfactual cases, we suggest a framework for analysis of systemic socio-ecological change in settlements in the Brazilian Amazon, and reconsider the role of ICDPs in landscape approaches to environmental governance in tropical forests.

The major drivers for productivity differences appear to be the levels of input use, the management practices employed, the age of the operator, the ease of access to markets, and the level of engagement in extension efforts. The findings lead to a number of policy implications. First, there are high rates of return to investments in the development of better seed varieties. Second, the payoff to investments in extension efforts is also high. Third, targeting efforts to increase women's access to teff plots will improve incomes for women. Fourth, reducing the costs of remoteness through the construction of rural roads and increasing distribution outlets of modern inputs is likely to have a positive impact on teff productivity. Finally, innovations that reduce labour requirements for growing teff might satisfy the increasing demands for teff at an affordable price. © 2016 European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

    abstract = {Purpose: This article explores how voluntary certifications influence the way cooperatives provide advisory services to their members and the influence of these services on agricultural practices. Design/Methodology/Approach: Case studies were conducted in four representative Costa Rican cooperatives interviewing twenty interviewed cooperative administrators and members to determine changes in advisory services and farming practices over the past twenty years and factors which influenced those changes. Findings: Certifications induce cooperatives to offer new services to support farmers. Cooperatives form collaborations with new stakeholders or reconfigure existing collaborations to provide advisory services to their members. These services have helped to shape farmers’ attitudes about sustainable farming practices, though farm-level changes may be small. The main change at the cooperative level is adding new topics for group training, and certification issues are directly linked with practices such as maintaining a farm record book or wearing a mask when applying pesticides. Practices which compete with productivity are unlikely to change. Practical Implications: The results are useful to improve the advisory services provided by cooperatives by better identifying the key issues to be addressed to fulfill the certifications’ requirements. Theoretical implications: Cooperatives are a relevant player to induce more sustainable practices, by providing or coordinating advisory services, but their efforts cannot be seen disconnected from a broader institutional environment. Originality/Value: We demonstrate that certifications change the intensity and scope of advisory services and induce cooperatives to engage with a more diverse network of stakeholders. © 2016 Wageningen University.},

    abstract = {A study was made of measures to revitalize mountain ginseng cultivation in the eastern mountainous area of Muju, Jinan and Jangsu municipalities of North Jeolla province, South Korea. The targeted area is typical forested land and is utilized for the cultivation of ginseng. Access to seeds and seedlings for mountain ginseng cultivation is relatively easy in North Jeolla province, and the species is cultivated widely (on 63 % of the area of the province and by 74 % of farmers). This study investigated the current state of mountain ginseng cultivation and business management, including production costs and subsidy, sales and distribution system, and other business management concerns. A survey was conducted on 86 mountain ginseng-cultivating farming households living in the targeted area in 2013. It is concluded that to achieve greater production an aggressive government policy promoting the renting out of suitable sites for mountain ginseng cultivation in national and public production forestland to individual farms and farming cooperatives is necessary. Further research on increasing the survival rate of cultivated mountain ginseng (CMG) until harvesting and preventing damage by wild animals is also deemed necessary. More effective use of related municipal budget subsidy needs to be supported selectively to the enterprising farmers who aggressively pursue mountain ginseng cultivation and business management. Opening CMG retail stores to realize sustainable income growth and developing various processed products will increase farm income. The government needs to introduce policies to sustain consumer trust in CMG through initiatives such as establishing a CMG quality management system for growers, distributing government-approved seeds, and implementing a government-based CMG purchase system. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

    abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to utilize legitimacy theory to test the association between the governance of credit unions and their social and environmental disclosure in a developing country, Kenya. A further examination of institutional pressures due to regulatory forces on the association between cooperative governance and credit union social and environmental disclosure (CSED) is performed. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample comprising of 1,272 credit union observations over the period 2008-2013, panel OLS regressions are performed to establish the association between co-operative governance and CSED. A comparison of the pre- and post-regulatory influences on co-operative governance and CSED is also performed. Findings - The findings, which are in support of both legitimacy and institutional theories, depict a positive and significant association between co-operative governance and CSED. The significance of the co-operative governance score improves from the pre-regulation period to the post-regulation period. Other significant variables influencing the volume of CSED by credit unions in Kenya include credit union size and financial performance as measured by the return on assets. Research limitations/implications - The study examines CSED practices in a developing country and in organizations in a single sector. Further, CSED is measured using a self-constructed index with data being obtained from audited annual reports only. Practical implications - The study highlights the need to develop CSED guidelines tailored for credit unions, and a focus on co-operative governance as a way of improving disclosure practices. Originality/value - The study utilizes a sector-specific governance variable and a CSED index to examine the association between the two variables by credit unions in a developing country. The study also attempts to investigate the role of regulation on the association between co-operative governance and the volume of CSED. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {In Europe, mainly in the Mediterranean region, an intensive usage of pesticides was recorded during the past 30 years. According to information from agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley (Figueira da Foz, Portugal), Primextra® Gold TZ is the most used herbicide in corn crop fields and one of the 20 best-selling herbicides in Portugal. Copper is mainly used in pesticide formulations. This study aims to determine the ecotoxicological and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) effects of the herbicide Primextra® Gold TZ and the metal copper on marine plankton. The organisms used in this study are three planktonic species: the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, the estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa and nauplii of the marine brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Fatty acids (FAs) are one of the most important molecules transferred across the plant-animal interface in aquatic food webs and can be used as good indicators of stress. The conducted lab incubations show that T. weissflogii is the most sensitive species to the herbicide followed by A. tonsa (EC50 = 0.0078 mg/L and EC50 = 0.925 mg/L, respectively), whereas the copepod was the most sensitive species to the metal followed by T. weissflogii (EC50 = 0.234 mg/L and EC50 = 0.383 mg/L, respectively). A. franciscana was the most tolerant organism both to the herbicide and to the metal (EC50 = 20.35 mg/L and EC50 = 18.93 mg/L, respectively). Changes in the FA profiles of primary producer and primary consumers were observed, with the increase of saturated FA and decrease of unsaturated FA contents, especially of highly unsaturated FAs that can be obtained mainly from food and therefore are referred to as 'essential FA'. The study suggests that discharges of Primextra® Gold TZ or other pesticides mainly composed by copper may be a threat to plankton populations causing changes in the FA contents and thus in their nutritive value, with severe repercussions for higher trophic levels and thus the entire food web. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite this fact, in Iran and many other developing countries, they have not had remarkable successes in this regard. Because strategy formulation and management is a plan to obtain far-reaching development effects of any organization. This study aimed to present a hybrid method to formulate and choose strategies for rural cooperatives development. It combined SWOT analysis, TOWS matrix, and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). We applied brainstorming technique to analyze the external and internal environment of rural cooperatives using the contributions of an experts’ team comprising 10 individual CEOs of rural cooperatives and senior employees of the Central Organization of Rural Cooperatives. When this team identified key SWOT factors, TOWS matrix was constructed to create good strategic alternatives. Finally, ANP was applied to prioritize the strategies. According to results, 19 key strategic factors such as lack of management knowledge (W4), and ability to improve value and supply chains (S4) were identified. In addition, this team identified 11 strategic alternatives which among them Implement public policy and provide technical and financial services (SO2), Facilitate procurement of inputs and develop supply and value chains (SO1) and Involve rural cooperatives in policy planning (ST1), had greater priority in Iran. The experts’ team believed that the presented combined approach helps decision makers and managers to make and choose the best alternative strategies and factors that affect rural cooperatives development. © 2017, Tarbiat Modares University.

    abstract = {Purpose: Farmers’ selection of vegetable marketing channels directly affects their income and is important to stable vegetable supply and food control. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the farmers’ selection behavior of vegetable marketing channels, and to determine the key factors which affected farmer’ decision making. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 191 valid questionnaires were collected from 50 villages in seven main vegetable production districts in Beijing urban areas from September to December 2015, yielding a response rate of 86.8 percent. The multinomial logit model was used for analysis in this study. Findings: The results revealed that the farmers mainly selected farmers’ market, cooperative, and wholesaler to sell their vegetables, which comprised 96.57 percent of total vegetable sales. Estimation results showed that cooperative, vegetable acreage, price satisfaction, and slow sales were most important factors which influence positively the probability of opting to sell vegetables at a cooperative rather than at the farmer’s market. For wholesalers, gender of the household head and cooperative had most significantly negative effect, and age had a positive impact on farmer’s choice of market channels. Originality/value: The results and implications obtained in the present study could help policymakers to establish a scientific-based and reasonable policy to encourage vegetable producers to participate in the circulation of vegetables in Beijing and guarantee their income in vegetable supply chain. The suggestions of this study could also be used for the improvement of the vegetable sector in other cities facing similar issues. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In the context of cooperatives, was investigated 24 management accounting practices more frequently addressed in studies on the subject, and it was identified that the analysis of product profitability, break-even point and contribution margin are the most adopted, while balanced scorecard, just in time and EVA are the least adopted. It was observed that traditional practices (developed until 1965) are used more intensively than modern practices (developed after 1965), corroborating previous studies in different samples, contexts and countries. It was identified that the traditional practices are grouped between those of high and medium level of adoption, while those of low adoption are, in totality, modern practices, demonstrating that these have not yet been widely introduced in the management systems of agricultural production cooperatives investigated. © 2017, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

We identified several fragmentations that constrained value chain performance and weakened its integration. The major causes of fragmentation were a lack of value chain thinking, opportunistic traders, weak cooperative organizations, poor information sharing, and less support from the malt factory and breweries to upstream members of the chain. A conceptual framework was designed to guide future analysis, open managerial and policy dialogues, and initiate questions for future research to identify new ways of linking small-scale farmers to the large agro-processors in Sub-Saharan Africa. © The Author(s) 2016.},

    abstract = {The interest in the creation of cooperatives arises in the early nineteenth century due to the need to promote improvements in the quality of life of workers of the time. Thus, the literature on the subject asserts that the first cooperatives originated from the struggle for better living conditions and improvements in their remuneration, seeking to meet the interests of lower-income workers and rural producers. After analyzing the main factors underlying the historical evolution of cooperatives, the article presents the theoretical principles established by the Transaction Costs Theory (TCT) aiming to interpret the process of commercialization of production as carried out by agricultural cooperatives. It is understood that a cooperative consists in a complex of contracts, being an important institution that seeks to save transaction costs by internalizing the marketing of cooperative members. This fact is not much explored in the literature that discusses agribusiness in Brazil. The paper concludes that it is possible to establish a connection between TCT and the nature of agricultural cooperatives since the contracts signed reduce the risks of opportunistic behavior and the uncertainty that producers would face if they resorted to the market to transact their products. © 2016, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

    abstract = {There is a growing trend towards small-scale forest operators engaging in certification initiatives in response to growing demands for certified timber. We aimed to analyse whether certified smallholders gain better access to timber markets and better financial incentives. We used three smallholder forest enterprises from Gunungkidul and Kulon Progo districts, Java, Indonesia as case studies of different managerial operations. Two were farmer cooperatives and the other was an external trading company in partnership with village-level farmer groups. Different certification schemes and managerial approaches were analysed whether such factors influenced the ability of smallholders to access certified timber markets and obtain improved offers for their timber. We found that smallholders find it challenging to enter and participate in certified timber markets and to obtain the promised premium prices. The obvious costs of certification and uncertain benefits are major challenges for smallholders. Even when market opportunities are present, certification alone is insufficient to tap into these markets. Certified forest enterprises need dedicated managers with adequate entrepreneurial skills to establish networks and contacts with potential buyers, and to actively seek information on what is specified by certified timber processors. © 2017, Kassel University Press GmbH.

    abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the theoretical and empirical possibility of measuring trust and commitment in collective actions. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs choice experiments to estimate trust implicitly as opposed to the common practice of measuring trust explicitly. Several experiments were conducted to assess members' level of trust and commitment to marketing cooperatives in rural Ethiopia. Findings - The results of the study indicate that significant number of farmers do not yet have trust in their organization and fellow members in both absolute and relative terms. The probability of trust increases when members actively participate in cooperative governance, are less diverse, stay longer in the cooperative, and when cooperatives are older. The authors also learnt that both trust and commitment have indeed improved the performance of farmers' market organizations. Trust in cooperative is asymmetrically sensitive to incentives and disincentives. Research limitations/implications - The study implied that research efforts attempting to estimate trust in collective action shall use an implicit measurement and consider the sensitivity of trust to relativeness, incentives and types of transactions. Practical implications - The findings of this study showed that rural organizations that are established with external help, such as agricultural cooperatives in Africa, seem to struggle to earn the trust of their current and potential members. This implies that given the effectiveness and persistence of informal rural organizations emerged through mutual trust, cooperatives must be organized either through informal ways as trust-based organizations or based on cooperative business principles of voluntarism and independence. Originality/value - This paper employs the behaviorally appealing choice experiment approach to capture the different aspects of trust such as relativism, sensitivity of trust to incentive and types of transactions in smallholder producers' organizations. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study aimed to analyze activities and linkages in the Thai canned lychee supply chain and to identify problems and obstacles including how to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. Data were collected from a survey of key players in the supply chain including farmers, local lychee collectors, agricultural cooperatives, canned lychee factories, exporters and importers. In addition, this research has also applied the value stream mapping (VSM) to classify the supply chain activities into three main activities include value added (VA), non- value added (NAV) and necessary non-value added activities (NNVA). After analyze value stream mapping in the current state this research found that NVA can be eliminated or reduced such as activities of intermediaries and some production process. The new VSM can reduce the supply chain activities significantly. This paper provides insights into a global fruit value chain with empirical evidence of improvement. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

The main tools to implement the quality management are based on the adoption of specific production regulations and quality controls. The premium price most frequently applied by processors ranges from 10% to 40% and similar values are revealed for retailers.

    abstract = {In many respects it is Jamaican women who play a pivotal role in small-scale farming, particularly in marketing farm produce. More highly educated than men, and gender-wise, women farmers are highly self-reliant; however, their socio-economic strength is not fully capitalized through cooperative endeavors to foster productivity on their farms. This research examines women's cooperatives and the operations of women farmers in two remote rural communities using focus group discussion and targeted on-site investigation approaches. We find that over the years, small farming cooperatives are unsustainable because of their land-tenure problem, and lack of decision-making power at the grassroots level. The research suggests that the potential of women farmers in rural Jamaica has not been well utilized to foster their farming cooperatives. Crucially needed is the promotion of grassroots-based farming groupings to ensure the durability of cooperatives, as well as a multi-sector approach in agriculture, and the intensification of appropriate technological applications in all stages of farming, coupled with micro-food processing. Furthermore, a conducive environment for agricultural production and economic return requires land reform, increasing marketing opportunities, and cooperatives based on the diversification of agricultural and non-agricultural activities. © 2017 Journal of International Women's Studies.},

Land inequality was serious in the region under the Republic of Vietnam's regime. The new government struggled with agricultural collectivisation contributing to the decline in rice productivity. This study explains the persistence of a market-based agricultural production in the southern economy under the new political regime. Beside the economic reasons and arguments of local peasants' everyday politics cited in the literature, we argue that the de facto political power of the middle-class landowners was an important factor impeding the performance of agricultural cooperatives. It also implies that agricultural productivity was more vital than land inequality during the study period. We apply the model of Acemoglu and Robinson explaining how de facto political power helps elites to maintain their economic institutions in spite of a political change. © 2016 Crawford School of Public Policy of the Australian National University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

    abstract = {This piece presents the life and work of Mayor Ferdinand Duchatsch, doctor of law and politician. As the title of the piece suggests, the author would like to especially emphasise the dual nature of his national allegiance. Even his contemporaries noted that he was Slovenian by origin, but considered himself German, although he would occasionally, especially at prelection rallies, emphasise his Slovenian origin. Ferdinand Duchatsch was born on 1. February 1845 in Maribor to his father Franc Xavier (1788-1870) and his mother Marie, born Kriehuber (1808-1900). Like his father, who became a citizen of Maribor in 1832, Ferdinand Duchatsch studied law. After his father died he took over management of his law firm. The name Duchatsch can be found among bankruptcy managers, jurors and legal advocate in lawsuits and criminal proceedings. Duchatsch's political work began with his election to the Maribor municipal council in 1869, to which he was later repeatedly elected. Unlike his father, who was disinterested in higher politics, Duchatsch managed to succeed in the wider political arena. In 1878 he was elected as a representative in the provincial assembly, two years earlier (1876) he was elected as a representative in the state parliament. In 1880 he left both positions because of, as he put it in the resignation letter, family affairs. Nevertheless, three years later he achieved the high point of his political career - the municipal council managed to get him elected as mayor of Maribor in their third attempt. He was in this position until early 1886, when he was succeeded by Alexander Nagy. The following events, that transpired while he was mayor, should be emphasised: a visit form emperor Franz Joseph I. (July 1983 and September 1885), the unveiling of a monument honouring archduke Johann (July 1883), the unveiling of a monument in honour of admiral Tegetthoff (July 1883, as the emperor was visiting), the completion of the Landwehr barracks, hospital addition, the construction of the Loška street and the connection between Tovarniška and Kopališka street, the regulation of a ditch in Graško suburbs, the regulation of Kopališka, Žička and Ribiška streets, the connection between Schmiderjeva and Verbanska street, the ratification of a plan for the cities expansion, the restoration of the cathedral, the excavation of canals in ČRNA and Brvarska streets, the purchase of two waggons and devices for pneumatic emptying of sewage tanks, the construction of the City savings bank and a girls school (both were opened in May 1886), the construction of a footbridge for connecting the Koroško suburb and the right bank of the Drava river (opened in May 1886) etc. In the time Duchatsch was mayor there were allegations made by the opposition about the in-transparent and poorly thought out budgets of the city municipality, these large debts, the choice of construction contractors and other city work past any kind of public applications, hidden financing of the newspaper Marburger Zeitung by the municipality and the influence on its editorial policy. The main objections coming from the Slovenian and catholic side was the favouring of Germans and intolerance to the Roman catholic church. Apart from political activity Duchatsch was also active in many societies and associations: Theatre and casino society, German education society, Society for the support of poor pupils, Choir society, Men's coir society, Volunteer firefighting society, Wine trader's association of Styria, Veteran society, AustroHungarian civil servant's society, Styrian horse breeder's society, Exercise society, Philharmonic society, Slovenska matica etc. He was also a member of city and district school councils, railway committee in the state parliament, auditor in Ekskompt bank, supervisor of the Fruit farmers' cooperative etc. In his private life he occupied himself with viticulture (he was one of the wine exhibitors at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873), singing (baritone), he was a popular speaker and lyric. About his appearance we only learn from the newspapers that he had a squint in one eye and a large belly. Dr. Ferdinand Duchatsch died in the Graz mental hospital Feldhof on 13 December 1887.},

    abstract = {Following the revolution in 1956, Hungary's agrarian policy went through changes and reforms unprecedented within the socialist block. The most important reform was the abolition of the system of compulsory delivery. This article aims to outline how the political change affected agrarian economics and also highlights the significant role played by some scholars, with their latent presence and their policy suggestions, which the Kádár Government had the courage to support in November 1956. With the emergence of the so-called Agrarian Lobby, of the intertwining networks of politicians, administrators, and scientists of the agrarian sector, the personal and intellectual preconditions had already been in place before 1956. Institutionalization, however, could only come about after the partial rehabilitation of market economy. The post-1956 political leadership could only meet the challenge of re-defining the relationship of the state and the agricultural cooperatives with the contribution of professionals. At the same time, the shape and nature of Kádár era agrarian economic research were also affected by the alliance between the practitioners of the field and the emerging network of agro-politicians and administrators, the Agrarian Lobby. Two key figures, Ferenc Erdei and Lajos Fehér, shared the responsibility for the better performance of agriculture. This paper also pays attention to the way their cooperation on this reform policy-oriented research was realized and the key role it played in the Hungarian agricultural cooperatives' emancipation from the bonds of the kolkhoz model in the 1960s. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

    abstract = {Much of the scholarship on the work and legacy of activist Fannie Lou Hamer concentrates on her tireless efforts for civil/human rights and African American representation and access to electoral politics. This article brings to light an important project she started in 1969, Freedom Farms Cooperative (FFC) in Sunflower County, MS. An agricultural cooperative built on 680-acres, Freedom Farms included a pig bank, Head Start program, community gardens, commercial kitchen, a garment factory, sewing cooperative, tool bank, and low-income, affordable housing as strategies to support the needs of African Americans who were fired and evicted for exercising the right to vote. Freedom Farms offered these sharecroppers and tenant farmers educational and re-training opportunities including health care and disaster relief for those who wanted to stay in the Mississippi Delta. Using a historical method to analyze extensive archival records, this article offers an analysis of Freedom Farms and illuminates valuable lessons on agriculture as resistance, and alternative strategies of rebuilding and investing in sustainable communities. Using the principles of collective and shared ownership, Freedom Farms and the work of Ms. Hamer, offer us important and valuable lessons on rebuilding our communities and investing in sustainable cities around growing food. This article outlines some of these lessons. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {In this study the analysis of the condition and the development of modern production systems of agricultural industry are provided. The process of reforming of agro-industrial complex of the Republic of Kazakhstan caused the necessity of transformation of production systems and their reduction in compliance to structural changes of agricultural production. The changes in production systems of agricultural industry of Kostanay region, which happened during development of the market relations are shown in the article; the analysis of volumes of crop production and livestock production in general on the area and on categories of farms is given. The main problems of functioning production systems are monopolization of grain production in the spring-sown field; concentration of bigger volume of production of livestock production in the farms of the population, small-scale unorganized production; seasonality of work; violation of the principle of a permanency of fixing of manpower to technical means and objects of production; ignoring of rational, specialized forms of job management; insufficient employment of a rural population in social production. All of these found reflections in performance indicators of the functioning of production systems are consequences of lack of evidence-based approach to the process of forming of their efficiency. It is proved that rural consumer cooperative has a number of advantages before other forms of conducting agricultural production. Results of economic-mathematical modeling to determine its fundamental role is increase in efficiency of functioning of production systems. © International Economic Society.},

For the evaluation of financial performance were used for calculation of outcome indicators gross margin, operating margin and net margin. The results show that when only analyzed the financial performance, the non-industrialized cooperative obtains a result of the business end better than the industrial cooperatives.

Trust fosters cooperation in many economic and social interactions and is important to the success of traditional agricultural cooperatives. Little is known about how trust affects farmers’ willingness to cooperate to provide an ecosystem service, what types of trust are most important, and under what conditions trust may matter. In this study, we present results of a survey of Missouri crop farmers exploring the role trust plays in farmers’ stated willingness to cooperate to control pests. We find that most farmers say they are willing to cooperate, and most farmers are willing to trust others. However, we find little evidence that trust positively influences farmers’ willingness to cooperate to control pests. Instead, we find that trust may only matter under certain conditions, such as when participants’ farms are dissimilar, and that other determinants, such as the perceived benefit of cooperation and environmental concern, are more important than trust to farmers who are contemplating cooperation to control pests. © 2016 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC},

Originality/value: In recent years, the microfinance community has witnessed unwanted consequences of microcredit misuse. We present an original approach about the way credit unions may achieve their target in a responsible way, offering appropriate products, services and training to the entire community involved. Design/methodology/approach: Through secondary data and interviews with decision makers and credit union members, we studied the case of Cresol Baser, a large credit union in Brazil. We analyzed data based on inductive theorizing. First and second-order themes were identified, resulting in a procedural model, representing relationships between responsible microfinance factors. Findings: The three main dimensions in the model of inclusive microfinance - conditions, proximity, and access - were integrated in order to promote a dynamic that respects the assumption of a responsible financial inclusion with regards to design, offer and access of products and services related to microfinance. © 2017 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

The study analyses the views of 106 preparers of SACCO disclosures. Principal Component-Factor analyses and ordinary least squares regression approaches are utilized to establish significant disclosure items and drivers. The findings show that SACCO disclosures are mainly addressed to members and the regulator. SACCOs provide disclosures to comply with regulations as well as build their image. The results reveal that disclosures by SACCOs in Kenya mainly center on mandatory financial aspects, which is followed by voluntary disclosure on strategic aspects, social aspects, governance aspects and environmental conservation in that order. The findings show that disclosures by SACCOs in Kenya are positively influenced by governance. According to the findings, the influence of the disclosure guidelines issued by the professional accounting body in Kenya and financial performance on disclosure seem to be weak.Other significant drivers of disclosure by SACCOs include resources (assets) and licensing.The findings are useful to policy makers in designing anoptimal disclosure policy for SACCOs in a developing country context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

A large questionnaire dataset consisting of 845 financially literate subjects enabled testing of the form in which residual and control rights provide incentives for non-producer investors to invest in agricultural firms. The choice experiment data were analyzed using a latent class model. The results demonstrate that the subjects were interested in the currently hypothetical, new types of investment instruments in agricultural producer cooperatives. Three investor classes were distinguished based on the preferences: returnseeking, ownership-oriented and risk-averse investors. Who controls the firm appears to be irrelevant concerning willingness to invest, while the rural ties of the respondent are positively related to the preference for voting rights. © 2017, MTT Agrifood Research Finland.

In addition to linking smallholders to markets, cooperatives provide their members with various services, such as extension, credit, input subsidies, and social programmes. While the literature contains many examples of success, there has been limited discussion on the often long and turbulent process by which cooperatives develop over time and the viable options for shortcuts. This study examines four emerging cocoa cooperatives in Peru to determine their overall business viability, the key factors that advanced their development, and their capacity to address the needs of their members. Our findings suggest that strategies for supporting cooperative development have largely failed to address major internal weaknesses and the challenges posed in the external environment. The cooperatives have received time-bound, uncoordinated, and often small-scale, interventions, which have focused on infrastructure expansion and technical assistance. Important areas related to business management and governance structures, trust relationships with buyers, and sufficient working capital have largely been ignored. Shortcuts may be achieved through improvements in access to business development and financial services, deeper engagement by private sector to support the development process, and commitment by stakeholders to monitoring and critical reflection for strategy refinement. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

To this aim, through an empirical investigation of their Websites, we analyze the propensity of these banks to provide Social Reports. Within the stakeholder management theory, the attention to mission, the number of stakeholders identified, the prospects of social reporting and their structure, and other aspects, are analyzed. Although many researches show that banking systems with a high number of cooperative banks can handle future potential periods of financial stress more efficiently, on the empirical side, the survey highlights that these banks are not ready yet to address the growing audience of potential customers who seem to be more interested in the respect of ethical and social conditions. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

    abstract = {To pursue development goals, policymakers and scholars alike have proposed that actors in rural areas may usefully engage in collective actions, e.g. by forming community groups, producer associations or multi-actor networks. One proposed benefit of such collaborations is the enhanced knowledge exchange and learning which may be created, and in the literature the dynamics of this are often explained via the concepts of embeddedness and/or social capital. To date however, studies tend towards a somewhat narrow, territorial, interpretation of these concepts, with the result that current understanding of how collaborations and learning evolve between rural actors is rather constrained. This paper aims to explore a broader interpretation of these concepts, through case analysis of a producer cooperative in the Scottish shellfish sector. In the case, the realities of member and management relations are revealed, along with the types of knowledge generated and the processes by which these are, or are not, shared between actors. In terms of embeddedness, our analysis reveals that, rather than the local community context which tends to dominate the literature, it is sectoral norms and habits which shape actor relations and learning most significantly in this case. In terms of social capital, we identify that tension-fuelled social relations are not in themselves a barrier to collaboration, again in contrast to existing claims, particularly where key actors have appropriate interpersonal skills, and where a values-based mindset ('cooperative know-how') is held in common. The findings therefore challenge popular assumptions about how embeddedness and social capital shape collective action and learning in rural areas, and illustrate the value of interpreting these concepts more expansively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

To achieve the proposed aim, an exploratory qualitative study of the four cooperatives operating in the sheep meat production chain in the State of Paraná in the year 2016 was done. Managers of these cooperatives and production chain experts were interviewed. For the analysis of results, cooperatives were classified into two groups: those which engage in various agro-industrial activities, and those which work exclusively in the sheep industry. The results obtained showed that there is not a single sheep production technological standard in the State of Paraná, and that cooperatives already worked in other agribusiness segments, the sheep industry being an additional activity in the portfolio of these companies, which seem to achieve better results by including this activity, involving higher expectations of expansion and seeking strategies to overcome major challenges, especially those related to animal slaughter and meat/meat by-product processing. © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

We aimed to identify the forms of structuration and financial-accounting peculiarities of agricultural cooperatives with higher volume of sales in the Brazilian context under the point of view of noncooperatives in the same segment. The work started with a documentary analysis and an accounting technique, named vertical analysis; in the next step, we used Mann-Whitney test to compare the formative lines of DRE of the a set of 15 cooperatives and 14 non-cooperative companies discriminated as belonging to organizations with higher sales in agricultural production in 2013. The results confirm the extent of the cooperatives structure in relation to the business portfolio, given the remarkable activities in concentric and conglomerate diversification. We observed the competitive parity between the business segments analyzed, mainly because there were no differences in the final rates of "profitability" when we compare the two cases. In addition, we can apparently refute the idea that this competitive parity is given by an orientation excessively directed to the market, at the expense of a social orientation, given the differentiating points externalized.},

Key principles identified for effective PAR agroecological processes include a shared interest in research by partners, a belief in collective power/action, a commitment to participation, practicing humility and establishing trust and accountability. Important lessons to consider for future work include: (1) research processes that did not start as PAR, can evolve into it; (2) farmer/stakeholder participation in setting the research agenda, from the outset, results in higher engagement and enhanced outcomes; (3) having the right partners for the desired outcomes is key; (4) intentional and explicit reflection is an essential component of PAR processes; and (5) cross-generational collaborations are crucial to long-term benefits. Key challenges that confront PAR processes include the need for time and resources over longer periods; the complexity of multi-actor process facilitation; and institutional barriers within the academy and development organizations, which prevent shifting investment towards integrated PAR agroecological processes. © 2017 by the authors.},

    abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore how the implementation of enterprise risk management (ERM) practices can help organisations to pursue both economic and social goals. To do so, we look at the credit cooperative banking sector, which often attempts to conduct socially responsible business practices. To deepen our understanding of how such banks deal with risk, we provide an in-depth study of one credit cooperative bank. The analysis highlights the peculiarities of ERM practices implemented in a specific context and explains how an ERM system enables credit cooperative banks to manage the risks associated with a duality of purpose. This research is relevant from a theoretical perspective because it addresses new trends in the risk management literature, thus elucidating how ERM systems can be implemented to support dual-purpose organisations. The study also adds to the literature on ethical banking, as it offers an in-depth description of how ERM systems work in this particular context. This paper also has practical implications; it provides insights to similar banks on how to manage risk in a way that supports social development in their local communities. Our analysis is also of interest to other types of socially-oriented businesses, which may follow a similar approach to operationalise ERM practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper analyzes the impact of participation of honey producers in the Northern highlands of Tigray, Ethiopia in contracts and marketing cooperatives on their performance and wellbeing. The paper finds positive production and economic gains honey producers obtain from contract engagement. Honey producers under the contract scheme produce more white honey fulfilling the demand of processors, buyers and consumers. Contracting results in higher production due to the better access it causes to technology and skill transfers. Moreover, better conditions contracts offer motivates honey producers to produce more and supply larger to the market. © 2016, Alemu et al.},

We have designed a capabilities and abilities (CA)-BDI farmer decision-making model, which is an extension of the BDI architecture and includes internal representations for farmer household Capabilities and Abilities. This model is used to explore farmer learning mechanisms and to simulate the bounded rational decisions made by farmer households. Our case study focuses on the Gaoqu Commune of Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, China, where scallion is one of the main cash crops. After comparing the differences between actual land-use changes from 2007 to 2009 and the simulation results, we analyze the validity of the model and discuss the potential and limitations of the farmer land-use decision-making model under three scenarios. Based on the design and implementation of the model, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the CA-BDI framework is an appropriate model for exploring learning mechanisms and simulating bounded rational decisions; and (2) local governments should encourage scallion planting by assisting scallion farmer cooperatives and farmers to understand the market risk, standardize the rules of their cooperation, and supervise the contracts made between scallion cooperatives and farmers. © 2016, The Author(s).},

First, major shortcomings of dominating approaches for assessment of sustainability of farming enterprises like individual and family farms, agro-companies, agro-cooperatives etc. are summarized, and the needs for improvement underlined. Second, evolution of the “concept” and the major approaches for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises is discussed. More adequate definition of the farming enterprise’s sustainability is suggested as ability of a particular form to maintain its governance, economic, social and ecological functions in a long term. Finally, a specific for the conditions of Bulgarian agriculture framework for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises is proposed. The later includes a system of appropriate principles, criteria, indicators, and reference values for evaluating governance, economic, ecological and social aspects of farming enterprise’s sustainability as well as an approach for their integration and interpretation. The ultimate objective of this study is to work out an effective framework for assessing sustainability of farming enterprises of different type in the specific economic, institutional and natural environment, assist farm and agro-business management and strategies, and agricultural policies and forms of public intervention in agrarian sector. © 2015, ASERS Publishing House.

The plot- scale experiment was established in years 2013/14 and 2014/15 within the agricultural cooperative in Mojmírovce. There were four fertilization treatments on 600 m2 experimental plots in three replications in this experiment. The first treatment was unfertilized control. Other three treatments were fertilized by the same nitrogen dose of 160 kg.ha-1 and by increasing doses of sulphur. The second treatment was fertilized by a dose of 15 kg.ha-1 S, the third by a dose of 40 kg.ha-1 and a dose of 65 kg. ha-1 S was applied at the fourth treatment. The highest average yield 3.96 t.ha-1 was found when a dose of 40 kg.ha-1 S was applied. The application of sulphur in a dose of 65 kg.ha-1 was accompanied by a yield decrease by 11.4 % as compared to the treatment where a sulphur dose of 40 kg.ha-1 was used. An average oil content of 45.1, 45.5, and 44.0 % was found in treatments in which the doses of sulphur of 15, 40 and 65 kg.ha-1 were applied. No significant difference among the treatments fertilized by sulphur was found. The average oil production reached 1809, 1802 and 1595 kg.ha-1 in cases of treatments fertilized by sulphur doses of 15, 40 and 65 kg.ha-1.},

Two agricultural cooperatives of family farmers in the municipality (the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Goiás (Federação dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura do Estado de Goiás - FETAEG) and the Union of Rural Workers of Rio Verde (Sindicato dos Trabalhadores Rurais de Rio Verde)), representatives from four of the five companies that operate in the city’s biodiesel sector and that have been awarded the Social Fuel Seal (Selo Combustível Social - SCS) and 43 family farmers in Rio Verde who belong to the PNPB participated in this research (defined from an intentional non-probability sample). It was found that governance using contracts has been unable to limit possible opportunistic actions in the municipality. Uncertainty was identified on the part of the producers regarding their loyalty to cooperatives and companies as a result of prior unfavorable experiences, particularly in relation to the price charged by certain companies. Finally, the contract, while offering guarantees, may be adverse for the producer. © 2017, Universidade de Taubate. All rights reserved.},

Our empirical work analyzes panel data from 2001–2009 for Finnish cooperative banks and compares two empirical concepts of the membership ratio. We find evidence that monetary incentives are important reasons to join, but also the size of the community from which members are recruited plays a role. Over time, monetary incentives have increased and this may have contributed to faster growth in membership in cooperatives based in larger municipalities after these changes. Cooperatives attracting new members primarily on the basis of monetary rewards is also consistent, over time, with a reduction in the role of the common bond. © 2016 The AuthorsAnnals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC},

However, most existing environmental policies consider ecosystems' desirable properties as given, leading ecosystem managers to favor "turnkey" solutions. How could public policy better support local collective initiatives aiming at reconciling agriculture and the environment? This paper presents an empirical case study from western France, in which a partnership between an agricultural cooperative and an ecological research center resulted in a collective design initiative. We conceptually model this initiative drawing upon recent design theories and Georgescu-Roegen's 'fund-flow' model, defining 'ecological funds' as the starting point of a collective design process. The results highlight the importance of developing policy instruments that can better support local innovation processes through greater democratization. Adopting a design approach to sustainable agricultural landscape management could be particularly fruitful in situations where collective action is necessary but where there is no common good recognized as such, and no existing community identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

We examine these relationships empirically in two studies. In study 1, using data from 114 agribusiness cooperatives, we demonstrate that strategic attributes have a greater influence on organizational performance than organizational attributes. In study 2, we replicate the design from study 1, i.e., tracking attribute scores over time, with a subsample of 25 cooperatives 4 years later.

However, recently researchers reported that one of their primary challenges to their expansion is the high level of inefficient. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between growth and efficiency of SACCOS using economies of scale concept. Then we address the role of management of the capital structure and allocation of resources in the expansion of SACCOS. The study used financial statement data from 60 SACCOS in Tanzania for the period of 2004-2011. The findings supports that most of SACCOS are small and cost inefficient because the industry is young, but, the efficiency increases as SACCOS expand. Second the allocation of resources in liquid, financial and non-financial investment leads to no expansion in SACCOS. Thus, the growth of SACCOS via increasing loan to members, members' savings, shares, and institutional capital should be encouraged as it increases the efficiency of SACCOS. Also, SACCOS should minimize the allocation of assets in other investments which are different from credit to members. © 2016 CIRIEC.},

    abstract = {About 100 million rural households in China have obtained forest property certification, which could serve as collateral to help households obtain microloans intended for forest management and investment. However, it is still difficult for households to receive these loans using forests as collateral. The strong demand for loans from the Rural Credit Cooperative cannot be met. This paper attempts to understand microloan access behavior using 241 respondents in three typical Chinese counties. It argues that the loan is determined by both the demand from the household as well as the supply from banks. Logistic regression models are used to investigate what might affect accessibility to households’ microloans. Household characteristics like age, education, income, forest characteristics as well as the regional variation of loans are used as explanatory variables. Age, education and income as well as the perception of the bank services are found statistically significant. Other findings include that only half of the respondents who received loans supposed for forest management but use for other purposes. Most importantly, it is found that joint-loan arrangement is more suitable for small-scale households and direct-loan and guaranteed-loans are better match larger property size. A simplified loan-process and discount points would lower transaction costs and improve rural households’ accessibility to microloan using of forest property collateral. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

    abstract = {Takāful is an insurance mechanism which satisfies the religious values of Muslim consumers and which has exhibited steady growth in Islamic finance systems. However, takāful does not comprise a significant share of the global insurance market, which is dominated by stock-based, mutual and cooperative organisations. Despite literature advocating its appeal to non-Muslim consumers, there is a gap in research exploring consumer behaviour in this demographic group. This qualitative phenomenological study utilises the theory of planned behaviour as a framework to explore the beliefs and attitudes towards takāful among non-Muslim consumers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to identify potential salient mutual-cooperative and religious attributes. The data demonstrate that non-Muslim consumers are unfamiliar with takāful products and this knowledge deficiency generates attitudes that negatively influence decision making; however, the provision of product information reveals that faith-based attributes create beliefs that may be salient to attitude formation and influence decision making when applied to the theory of planned behaviour. This study is important for takāful researchers in advancing the discussion on non-Muslim consumer behaviour, and for takāful operators in understanding non-Muslim behavioural influences as part of a strategic expansion of that demographic. The results suggest further research is required to identify takāful’s salient attributes and their influence in the decision-making process for non-Muslims. In addition it asks what marketing and promotional strategies should be employed to improve awareness and understanding of takāful among non-Muslims. © 2016, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

Design/methodology/approach – Given that different indicator variables were used to measure apple quality, the authors employed a principle component analysis method to reduce the measurement dimension. An ordinary least square regression was employed to analyse the effects of member size and selective incentives of agricultural cooperatives on product quality. Findings – The empirical results show that member size and cooperative’s product quality bear an inverse “U-shape” relationship, and food safety certification and target market variables tend to positively and significantly influence cooperative’s product quality. In particular, the cooperatives with more food safety certificates and targeting supermarkets and export enterprises are more likely to supply high-quality products. Originality/value – This study provides the first attempt to measure apple quality and investigate the factors that influence cooperative’s product quality. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The article presents the influence assessment of significance of some selected variables from the entrepreneurs' accounting system on the achieved profit or loss of the agricultural companies in the Slovak Republic. Accounting information serves as an active tool for internal users for operational as well as strategic company management, and for external users the information is determined as legally binding output information which is a subject to disclosure. Individual financial statements of assessed agricultural companies are considered to be the relevant source of information. Agricultural companies are represented by commercial companies and agricultural cooperatives. Profit or loss after income tax presents the final complex effect of economic company's performance. The existence and development of companies is conditioned by assets which amount and structure depend on focus and the range of subject activity but as well as on specific factors set by the production process in the agricultural primary production. The increase in liabilities is notable by the influence of unsufficient amount of own company funding sources, mainly the increase in trade payables. The continuance of company reproduction process is secured by a bank loan drawdown. The income situation of companies of agricultural primary production is favourably influenced by the subsidies of non-investment character. During the observed period of years 2004 - 2014 the examined variables were assessed by means of statistical methods. The obtained results of rate determination of statistical correlation between selected variables by means of classical canonical analysis and non-parametric correlation analysis secured that in the assessed group of companies all analysed variables influenced statistically significantly profit or loss after income tax, mainly the total value of assets and non-investment subsidies, except for years 2010, 2012 a 2013, when the statistically insignificant correlations was determined between profit or loss and especially short-term trade payables and current bank loans. As regards the existence point of view it is recommended to companies to maintain the optimal assets and capital structure as well as the achievement of suitable profitability of company's activity. Only the complex attitude towards the subject issue can be the assumption of sustainability for companies of agricultural primary production in the Slovak Republic and the increase in their performance. © 2017 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences, License.},

    abstract = {In recent years, credit unions have increasingly purchased loan-participation agreements in order to diversify their loan portfolios and manage loan growth. Responding to high charge-off rates for these loans and concern for systemic risk, the National Credit Union Administration imposed in 2013 new rules on federally insured credit unions that limited the purchase of loan participations from a single originator to the greater of $5 million or 100% of net worth. This study uses a difference-in-difference framework to examine the effect the policy had on returns. As a result of the policy change, credit unions with a high share of net worth in loan participations earned, on average, a return on assets 47 basis points less than their counterparts. Further, we find evidence that suggests these lower returns were driven by a decline in participation loans with recourse provisions, liquidity issues, and relatively higher interest expenses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {This paper explores the significance of the relationships and disjunctures between the global moral discourses of Fairtrade that are articulated through ethics of fairness in supply chains and the everyday moral experiences, discourses and practices of producers that shape moral economies in specific localities. Due to increased governance through universal codes, standards and certification, Fairtrade risks becoming an abstract ethical and regulatory tool, disconnected from the moral economies of those poor farmers it is intended to benefit. In response, the paper makes a case for a deeper understanding of the moral economies of farmers involved in Fairtrade networks and the ways in which these emerge out of moral experiences that are deeply embedded in local social and cultural relations. Through a case study of Eksteenskuil Agricultural Cooperative in South Africa’s Northern Cape, it seeks to demonstrate the importance of understanding the moral experiences of producers to better consider what is at stake for them, focusing on notions of cooperation, fairness and the ‘good farmer’, perceptions of community, and concerns with survival and self-sufficiency. The paper concludes that working in culturally-sensitive ways with producer communities and understanding how their local moral worlds are structured is vital in bridging the gap between abstract ethical discourses and the place-based moral experiences of producers, and to ensuring the effectiveness of Fairtrade initiatives. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

    abstract = {The objectives of this study were to ascertain and assess the major incentive and monitoring schemes currently being applied in Maltese co-operatives as well as those types of schemes that may be applicable. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten committees of management members, ten professional managers and seven co-operative consultants. The study reveals a lack of application of both incentive and monitoring schemes in these entities. An over-emphasis on cost effectiveness is resulting not only in the current little application of such schemes, but also in obstacles towards the application of new ones in the future. Furthermore, any application of monitoring schemes in particular is perceived as having negative implications on the level of trust between the monitor and the monitored. Additionally, few incentives are being applied to promote co-operative principles despite the declared management willingness to do so. The study points out that a number of lacunas need to be overcome for the realization of both types of schemes. Co-operative managers need to become more aware of the objectives of their co-operative and also more determined towards promoting the co-operative principles. The paper also concludes that no trust implications need to arise in the implementation of any type of scheme as long these are well designed, explained and implemented. One recommended way towards promoting monitoring schemes is the introduction of an updated Co-operative Societies Act including new obligations on the internal control environment.},

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's (UNESCO) has included Langkawi's 99 islands in its global geopark network. One of the most popular geopark sites in Langkawi is Kilim Karst, originally developed as a fishing community under the management of the Kilim Community Cooperative Society (KCCS). Following Kilim's recognition as a geopark, the role of the KCCS has evolved to encompass the management of local geotourism activities, ensuring that the community's involvement is consistent with UNESCO's sustainable development benchmarks. This study discusses the role played by geoparks and geotourism in the cooperative community entrepreneurship of local populations. Using the interview method, the authors consider the role of community-based entrepreneurships in developing geotourism in Kilim. With the full cooperation of the local government, the KCCS helps to develop local entrepreneurs who lack fundamental business knowledge. The authors review the performance of the KCCS based on their 2011-2014 annual general meeting report. The results of this review, coupled with the growing number of tourists, reveal the success of the KCCS' commitment to supporting local entrepreneurship. The proceeds of these activities have subsequently been redirected to the diversification of the KCCS' business portfolio for the sustainability of the community. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

    abstract = {Smallholder farmers in developing countries are often encouraged to get organized into cooperatives mainly to overcome production and marketing constraints that usually hinder the improvement of their livelihoods. However, impact evaluations regarding the contribution of cooperatives are limited; evaluation results are mixed and are not conclusive. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the determinants and economic impacts of cooperative membership using household survey data gathered from coffee farmers in the Jimma Zone of Oromia, Ethiopia. A propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) models are used to estimate treatment effects by controlling for selection biases. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through group discussions made with randomly selected farmers in the study area. Findings indicate that the probability of farmers' membership decision increases with age, education level, family size, social networks, land property and accessibility to cooperatives. Both PSM and ESR models show that membership is positively associated with household income and assets. The ESR estimation results further confirm that members economically perform significantly better than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better than members if they had joined cooperatives. The results of group discussions also verify overall direct and spill-over effects, though cooperative services to members and non-members are undifferentiated. The results indicate a need for a mechanism to enhance the participation of poorer farm households, and to further improve member benefits as potential areas in making cooperatives more meaningful, attractive and sustainable. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

One hundred pig farms were sampled in a random and purposive procedure and data were collected using a standard pretested questionnaire. Production and management of pigs was affected by lack of organizational strategies to achieve economies of scale at farm level, poor access to market information, limited use of fair and meaningful quality standards, feed shortages during the dry season, disease risks such as African swine fever, and limited access to extension services, agricultural insurance, credit and other financial services. We found that the profit per pig was UShs.17495. Experience in years, amount of land area under piggery use, number of workers, number of pigs sold, making and use of budgets, record keeping and availability of extension services were found to have a significant relationship at 5% with the profit made from piggery business. The piggery business can be made more profitable by establishing farmer groups through which they can save some money and build capital for further investment in their farms. Cooperatives from where farmers can borrow money to support their farming activities should also be introduced. Farmers should be provided with proper extension services, genetically better and more disease resistant pig breeds. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.},

Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used as methods of data analysis. The result indicated that livelihood diversification, measured by the inverse Herfindahl–Hirschman diversity index, has a positive and significant effect on sustainable land management activities. Besides, farm households who participated in agricultural extension packages and those engaged in farm cooperatives and in non-farm wage employment activities joined significantly more in sustainable rural land management practices. The integrated rural livelihood and sustainable land management strategy that can help jointly maximise the farm household livelihood and the land management practices is required.

    abstract = {The attention to ethics has gradually become a concurrent topic of modern companies’ management. In the last years Social Responsibility has become a key issue in the strategic agenda of competitive agriculture cooperatives. However, reputation management has not been a visible strength in the cooperative enterprises. First of all, this work theoretically analyzes the relationship between Social Responsibility and reputation in cooperatives. Later, from a practical point of view, we carry on an empirical analysis focused on the olive oil cooperatives in the south of Spain, in the province of Jaén. With respect to the previous studies on the topic, this work reveals a main reason of interest reinforcing the role of research in addressing real problems of cooperatives. The article points out the characteristics of this kind of agribusiness and shows the importance of the adoption of a responsible orientation in fostering reputation for creating sustainable competitive advantages. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

    abstract = {Despite growing support for agricultural cooperatives as mechanisms for rural development, relatively little is known about how innovation spreads through, or is created within, the formal structure of a cooperative. This paper provides an ‘inside’ look at the social relationships operating within two agricultural cooperatives in rural Senegal (one well-functioning and the other poorly-functioning), focusing on self-reported innovation sharing and provisioning between members. Findings indicate that for both cooperatives, innovation was predominantly spread through formal vertical linkages (i.e. between hierarchal representatives), but was significantly controlled by key actors in leadership positions, resulting in large disparities in the innovation potential of different cooperative members. Social Network Analysis can help inform the design and evaluation of agricultural cooperatives by shifting the analysis to individual actors within the formal structure, potentially enabling new opportunities for enhanced cooperation to be identified and collectively strengthened. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

In particular, we were interested in a better understanding of how farmers viewed the social benefits associated with cooperation. These social benefits have the potential to become valuable sources of social capital. Four valid and reliable measures of social benefits were identified. Social benefits that farmers may use to get by (bonding networks) had two dimensions: emotional support and social support. Social benefits that farmers may use to get ahead (bridging networks) also had two dimensions: tangible and intangible resource sharing. The desire to gain these social benefits from cooperation (except for emotional support) emerged as strong predictors of farmers' willingness to cooperate in a proposed new agricultural cooperative. Surprisingly, the expected economic benefits of cooperation did not have a significant effect on willingness to cooperate. Implications and suggestions for future research and cooperative development and management are also discussed. © 2017 Morrow et al.},

Groups were categorized in Common Interest Groups, Cooperative Groups and Cooperatives. All groups were comparatively described according to member set-up, management, financing and marketing. Propensity score matching was used to evaluate the economic success, as one of the key factors for a long-term operation of farmer groups.

Marine Areas for Responsible Fishing (Áreas Marinas de Pesca Responsable, AMPR) have emerged as a new model for the co-management of small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica, one that involves collaboration between fishers, government agencies, and NGOs. The primary objective of this paper is to elucidate some of the key variables that influence collective action among small-scale fishers in Tárcoles, a community in the Gulf of Nicoya. We examined collective action for the formation of a local marketing cooperative and participation in management through the AMPR. We apply the social-ecological framework as a diagnostic and organizational tool in the analysis of several types of qualitative data, including interviews with key informants, informal interviews, legal documents, and gray literature. Findings illustrate the importance of socio-economic community attributes (e.g., group size, homogeneity, previous cooperation), as well as that of social (e.g., equity) and ecological (e.g., improved stocks) outcomes perceived as favorable by actors. In addition, our work demonstrates the importance of certain kinds of external NGOs for facilitating and sustaining collective action. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the advantages equity capitalization programs based on retained earnings from patronage sources may provide cooperatives and their patrons that traditional equity financing methods do not offer. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a model used to assess patron benefits from a cooperative that is financed by a combination of allocated equity acquired from noncash patronage refunds and unallocated equity acquired from retained earnings. The level of patron benefits is represented by the present value of the after-tax cash flow patrons receive from the cooperative, and the model is used to determine the combination of noncash patronage refunds and retained earnings that provides the greatest present value given the levels of those parameters that affect capitalization of the cooperative and the distribution of cash benefits to patrons. Findings: The analysis demonstrates that only pure plans, i.e., plans based entirely on retained patronage refunds or entirely on retained earnings, will be associated with the greatest present value for any particular set of parameter values. Cooperatives that are characterized by low marginal tax rates and growth rates and whose patrons are characterized by high marginal tax rates and discount rates are those most likely to benefit from equity capitalization programs based on retained earnings. Research limitations/implications: The model is based on the assumption of constant parameter values and does not account for the existence of nonpatronage income. Practical implications: A useful extension of this work would be the development of a decision aid capable of generating basic operating statement and balance sheet data and enabling cooperative decision makers to conduct experiments concerning alternative financing strategies based on retained earnings. Originality/value: The analysis contained in this paper is based on an explicit model and extends across a broad range of values for various parameters that affect the level, timing, and present value of cash distributions from cooperatives. Because the cash flow received by patrons is determined after the cooperative’s planned equity growth is met, cash flow comparisons are equivalent with respect to the capital provided the cooperative. In addition, the revolving period is endogenously determined. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The study compared the involvement of three milk collecting actors that were classified into large cooperative (KPSBU), small cooperative (KUD Puspa Mekar), and private company (Bina Kitri Bersama). A total of 18 dairy farmers, 3 milk collecting actors, 2 milk processors, and one livestock officer were interviewed. Three focus group discussions were conducted. The large cooperative performed better in services, milk collection, and milk quality assessment compared to other milk collecting actors. Members' commitment, inconsistent milk quality, and shortage of good quality fodder were the hindering factors that influenced the collection of good quality milk in the large cooperative. In conclusion, the large cooperative had better performance in service provision, it also had better infrastructures in milk collection and milk quality assessment compared to other milk collecting actors. Increasing the milk quality standard by milk processing companies affected the milk price since 2000.},

The main goal of this study was to analyse issues related to the management structure and financial performance of cooperatives, based on data collected for olive oil cooperatives located in the northern interior region of Portugal. Combining a qualitative analysis of structure and decision-making, a financial assessment and the application of a multi-criteria approach (PROMETHEE II), the overall results are in line with expectations (e.g. low levels of member participation, nonprofessional management, low profitability ratios, low leverage and an ability to fulfil financial commitments), except for the relationship between professional management and financial performance. The existence of professional management does not lead to better financial performance. This result reinforces the belief that cooperatives that are structured differently have different and conflicting stakeholder interests.},

The trial was conducted for 8 months from April to December 2015. Women farmers stocked six carp species and two small indigenous species (SIS) to ponds. Women farmers were divided into two groups. One group fed their fish with dough of rice bran and mustard oil cake, while the other group installed bamboo substrates in their ponds and fed their fish with half the amount of the feed used by the first group. Women farmers netted and weighed fish monthly to check fish growth and calculate rations. Women farmers were provided with a book to record fish harvested for consumption or sale and fish mortality. Final harvest was done after 8 months of culture. The netted fish were counted, weighed, and returned to the pond as the farmers wanted to keep fish for their biggest festival "Maghi" in mid-January. In aggregate, 84 % of farmers consumed fish at home, and 41 % of farmers sold carps. The trial showed that culturing carps with SIS with 50 % feeding amount and with bamboo substrates in ponds resulted in a 22 % higher fish production as compared to the culture of carps with normal feeding. More interestingly, the gross margin of the half-fed periphyton enhanced carp polyculture was almost two times as much as that of the normal fed polyculture system. Women farmers also benefited socially as well as economically from the interactions within the cooperatives, which increased their self-confidence and developed leadership skills in some members. © Asian Fisheries Society.},

A 2 by 2 between-subject design was adopted to generate variation in incentives and prior information about credit risks. Findings: Results showed that loan officers did ration credit by rejecting more loans when facing risks of personal income loss. However, providing risk information about the application pool boosted the approval rate and offset the behavioral responses by a roughly same magnitude. Research limitations/implications: Findings in this study suggest that certain institutional settings can result in credit rationing via strategic loan misclassification. Further, information sometimes generates similar effects as those costly incentives or mechanisms that are not implementable in practice. Originality/value: This study adopted an innovative monetized experimental design that allows researchers to examine the (otherwise unobservable) trade-offs between Type I and Type II error in loan misclassification as incentives change.

In this approach, the efficient management is crucial to that cooperatives offer the best that have to their members. Given the above, the purpose of the study is to analyze the efficiency of Brazilian credit unions, the CAMELS model. The research is descriptive, with documentary procedure and quantitative approach to the problem. Consolidated financial statements, disclosed by credit unions, available in the Central Bank’s website (2014), performed data collection. For the data analysis was applied the factor analysis, data envelopment analysis and absolute frequency. The survey sample consists of the 25 largest credit unions that make up the Central Bank ranking. The results show that the applicability of CAMELS model to determine the efficiency of credit unions offer relevant information to decision makers. Finally, it is concluded that 76% of the top 25 ranking of the Central Bank of credit unions were efficient in all periods analyzed. We conclude that the CAMELS model can be used as a complement to determine the efficient performance of the credit union, and a related advance to previously existing models such as the PEARLS and CAMEL. © 2017, Universidade de Taubate.

    abstract = {Research Question/Issue: This research investigates the antecedents of board members’ monitoring behaviors at the individual level. The main idea is that individuals who are both conscientious and identified with shareholders are those most likely to adopt monitoring behaviors. Research Findings/Insights: The study was conducted using a survey of 166 board members of a large Canadian credit union corporation. Data on monitoring behaviors were collected directly from the chairpersons of the boards they participate in. The results validate the hypothesized moderated mediation model in which perceived importance of monitoring by board members mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and actual monitoring behaviors, on the one hand, and identification with shareholders moderates the relationship between conscientiousness and the perception of the importance of monitoring, on the other hand. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By investigating the mediating effect of the perceived importance of the monitoring role in the relationship between conscientiousness and monitoring behaviors, our study provides an empirical test of the attention-based view in the context of boards of directors and thus contributes to opening the ‘black box’ of board behaviors. Further, by looking at the interactive effect of conscientiousness and identification with shareholders, our study brings new insights into the motivational drivers of directors’ monitoring behaviors. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study invites practitioners in charge of board members’ recruitment and selection to reconsider their practices in order to target individuals demonstrating high levels of conscientiousness. It also highlights the importance of implementing board cultures that value conscientiousness and emphasize shareholders’ interests. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

    abstract = {In Europe, mainly the Mediterranean region, intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides has been recorded over the past 30 years, exceeding, in some cases, the limits of contamination authorized by the European Union. The intensive use of pollutants in fields near ecological coastal wetlands has led to implementation of pesticide monitoring programs to recover aquatic systems such as the Mondego estuary (Figueira da Foz, Portugal). According to information from the agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley, Primextra®Gold TZ is the most-used herbicide in corn crop fields. Biomarkers, such fatty acids (FAs), proved to be new and potentially powerful tools to detect, illustrate, and evaluate exposure to and the effects of contamination hazards. They play important roles in establishing neural levels in organisms' biochemical and physiological responses and are considered good bio-indicators of stress and potential indicators of ecosystem health. Bivalves are currently used in ecotoxicological bioassays because of their ecological importance, wide geographic distribution, ease of handling in the laboratory and in the field, and their ability to filter and ingest large volumes of water and sediment particles. Thus, the main goal of this work was to determine the toxic and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) responses of two size classes (small and big) of the two marine bivalve species Cerastoderma edule and Scrobicularia plana to the herbicide Primextra® Gold. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the fatty acid contents, and thus the nutritive values, of both species and size classes collected in the field with those under laboratory conditions. Results show S. plana is more sensitive to the herbicide than C. edule. In general, among the larger-sized specimens in the field, S. plana is more nutritive than C. edule, but among the smaller-sized specimens, the opposite tendency is seen, where C. edule presents a greater abundance of FAs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {The grassland is the most important resource for the herdsmen in Inner Mongolia, China. In the 1980s, pastureland was administratively allocated based on household size. The subsequent changes in socioeconomic and new household characteristics suggest that adjustment is needed for more efficient land use. This study reviewed the recent progress of the rental market and investigated the herdsmen's behaviours regarding grassland market transactions in Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia. The economic assumption is that there exists a variation in values by household for each given parcel of land, which drives land transfer to users who can generate higher values. Each household is characterised by its initial pasture landholding, herding facilities and demographics. But the gain from the transfer must be deducted from the transaction costs, and cooperative membership can significantly reduce the transaction costs. An econometric model is developed and tested with data collected from household surveys in the Xilingol League. The results indicate that household size is the most significant variable for land transfer in the long run. Herdsmen have been dynamically adjusting herding equipment and pasture landholdings, allocating labour between herding and non-herding activities in response to these changes in society. Cooperative organisation was found to be significant in facilitating land transfer due to its role in reducing transaction costs. Higher quality land with higher rent is also found to be more likely to transfer since the percentage of the transaction cost is lower than lower quality land.  © Australian Rangeland Society 2017.},

    abstract = {This study aims to understand how financial transactions affect social relationships between farmers and directors of credit unions operating resources provided by government programs. The problem of research sought to understand the strategies of these leaders, called mediators, to articulate the symbolic universe of farmers, with the expectations of public policy and the circuit where the money flows. To understand this issue an empirical research was carried out in a Cooperative Credit System called Cresol. The theoretical framework that guided the analysis of the information articulated the concepts of frames (McAdam, McCarthy and Zald, 1999) and "negotiation of intimacy" (Zelizer, 2005). The conclusion is that the mediators operate its strategy of making trust and friendship (intimacy) on institutional affiliation. Its action acquires an instrumental bias in that converts economic transactions in intimacy, financial transfers in expanding and strengthening social relations and identity system. © 2017, Universidade de Brasilia.

It was developed through literature review and interviews in institutions related to certification in Brazil. Its main results indicate that: i) half of the farmers cooperatives in Brazil were certified between 2009 and 2015; ii) in a few cooperatives are concentrated the most of the coffee producers and most of the sales of fairtrade coffee; iii) Brazilian scientific research suggest that certification has contributed to the improvement of the property management and also to internationalization of the business; iv) international literature indicates advantages, but problems in the distribution of the benefits and also many where the certification’s impacts were derisory. Considering the global context of Brazilian coffee sector, still not possible to affirm whether fairtrade certification is or not achieving its goals. © 2017, Editora UFLA. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {The paper documents the post-war retrenchment and failure of the post-war British Consumer Co-operative Movement. In contrast to the general failure one CEO, Terry Thomas stands out both for his success in co-operative rebranding and returning to profitability the UK Co-operative Bank and because he alone amongst the top echelons of the Co-operative Groups Management based his strategies on a clearly articulated philosophy based on his understanding of the values and purpose of the co-operative movement rooted in its historical traditions grounded in the writings and achievements of Robert Owen, The paper goes on to provide a case study of the bank’s process of transformation from loss-making subsidiary to the first positive co-operative national brand in the post-war period of its history. The author argues that lack of appropriate vision based on the founding values and purposes of the Co-operative Movement is the principal reason for the management’s and governance failures that have beset the UK Co-operative Group. Instead of using the past to help in understanding the present and planning for the future, the UK Co-operative Group Leadership ignored it or worse used the past successes to congratulate itself and disguise its manifest failures. In this, they were supported by an uncritical Co-operative Union (later renamed Co-operatives UK). Davis argues large co-operatives cannot be managed by a civil service responsible to an elected board. Co-operatives need a servant-leadership model of professional management dedicated to the transformational goals set by the founders of the co-operative movement. This needs a radical rethink and promotion of co-operative management education and a dedicated executive recruitment that seeks out value-based professionals whose attitudes and values are compatible with Co-operative values, ownership and purpose. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

    abstract = {Farm subsidies have become increasingly maligned in agricultural policy debates, but the merits of subsidies are a distraction from deeper political, economic, and ecological problems in agriculture. Drawing on a history of the U.S. Farm Bill, this paper argues that a fixation on farm subsidies ignores why they came into being, and more generally glosses over the imperative for modern states to intervene into agricultural economies. Karl Polanyi's 'double movement' framework is used to situate the rise and fall of agricultural supply management within food regime theory. In the second, or surplus food regime, the U.S. government wielded excess commodities as geopolitical tools—even as domestic farm policy labored to contain overproduction, and thus support agrarian viability. In the subsequent corporate food regime, “free market” agriculture displaces and discredits supply management, even as massive government intervention into how food is grown and sold continues. Making space to remember historical price support programs, to situate their accomplishments and limitations, and to recognize residual supply-management mechanisms (such as farm cooperatives and agricultural marketing orders) is crucial for fostering agricultural viability in the US and beyond. Twentieth century supply management had flaws, but it cannot be wholly omitted. This paper highlights key motivations, elements, and contradictions of these policies and programs to begin the process of considering how supply management principles and strategies could be updated and enhanced for 21st century agriculture. Such a framework would need to pay more attention to diversity within domestic and international agricultures, and be more sensitive to the multi-scalar dimensions of food systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Although voluntary certification has recently gained importance in the agricultural industry, information asymmetry is not always completely addressed. This study analyzes how the relative proportion of boundedly rational consumers in the market influences the effectiveness of voluntary certification mechanisms by using a duopoly game model of high- and low-quality firms. The presented results show that a change in the proportion of boundedly rational consumers leads to different certification behaviors and a different market equilibrium. We also find that the existence of boundedly rational consumers is an important factor in the failure of voluntary certification. Indeed, when the relative proportion of such consumers is very high, voluntary certification is ineffective at improving market efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence, price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings: The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications: It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications: The research confirms that individual dairy farmer’s loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value: Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

According to the agency theory, banks influence the operations of SACCOS. However, empirical knowledge remains scant on the measures banks apply to control these operations and on SACCOS' governance-related reactions to bank requirements. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper explores measures used by banks to monitor and control SACCOS-partners in addition to assessing SACCOS' governance-related reactions to bank requirements. The paper utilizes data collected through in-depth interviews held with both the management of five banks selected primarily because of their active involvement in wholesale lending to SACCOS. In addition 11 SACCOS linked to these five banks were selected in Tanzania and Kenya. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. The findings reveal that measures applied by banks to monitor and control SACCOS-partners include accessing and investing in information on SACCOS-partners and their clients, and requiring both guarantees and forced savings. Compliance with these measures was found to result into two governancerelated reactions: 1) improved compliance with own by-laws, regulations, policies or procedures, and government regulations; and 2) realignment and/or reduced compliance with some of their own by-laws, policies, regulations, and procedures, and thus some of the government regulations, to accommodate bank requirements. © 2016 Practical Action Publishing.},

It focuses on the motivations of consumers to financially contribute to a cooperative by examining the risks and benefits associated with the investment. Based on a survey of 759 consumers, it links their motivations for joining a cooperative to different forms of risks and benefits associated with the investment. It shows that the risks related to cost sharing and switching costs are important determinants for consumers. Other factors that affected the likelihood of joining a cooperative were expected benefits with respect to user network externalities and infrastructure gains. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {While providing essential access for large portions of city populations, the quality of paratransit services in Sub-Saharan African cities is poor. Poor quality of service can be attributed to two features of the paratransit business operating model: driver remuneration on the basis of a daily ‘target system’; and cash-based business management in which vehicle depreciation is ignored as an operating expense. In Kenya, the voluntary organisation of fragmented inter-city matatu businesses into Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) has resulted in improved service, regulatory compliance and technology adoption, but little is known of how they operate. The aim of this paper is to gain insight into how the Kenyan inter-city matatu SACCOs are organised and have improved services, and to explore the transferability of this experience and the lessons it offers. The exploratory nature of the study, and constrained resources, necessitated that the research adopt a qualitative case study method. It was found that most of the case study SACCOs have addressed the root causes of poor service quality by shifting the remuneration of drivers from daily cash targets to salaries, and by requiring vehicle depreciation costing through compulsory contributions to the cooperative's capital savings from which vehicle acquisition and repair loans can be derived. Due to the particular shuttle-like nature of inter-city services and the considerable institutional support that exists in Kenya for cooperatives, the direct transfer of successes to other contexts is likely to prove difficult. Identifying the features of the inter-city SACCO model that have led to paratransit service improvements, and attempting to replicate these, may therefore be more effective than attempting to replicate the model in its entirety. These features are argued to be operator consolidation, accompanied by salaried drivers, systematic vehicle monitoring and compulsory vehicle depreciation costing. They can be adopted in other forms of paratransit organisation and regulation, but will require considerable adaptation to context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Specifically the study evaluated the capacity of FMCS in delivery effective marketing services to its members and ascertains the marketing functions performed by FMCS towards effective marketing services to farmers (members) in Benue state. Data were obtained from 306 respondents who are management committees of 36 selected FMCS. Data obtained were analyzed with appropriate statistical tools. Thus, evidence from the result revealed that, the FMCS are capable of delivering various marketing services to their members. Findings also revealed that the FMCS performed various functions that facilitate marketing of their members’ farm produce as most of these marketing functions are performed to a great extent, but advertising and awareness campaigned as well as market survey and market research are not properly delivered as part of marketing functions. So in a bid to strengthen the potentials of FMCS towards effective marketing services delivery to members, the following recommendations are provided. The government should endeavor to partner with FMCS by providing them with expertise and supply them with productive resources; also the government should design a synergy between Nigeria Export Promotion Council and FMCS, so that farmers can export their produce to international market which will boost the contribution of agriculture to the GDP. Finally, the cooperative leaders should design and invest in research and market survey which will boost the competitiveness of cooperative in the competitive environment. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

This type of pollution, even though not always due to agriculture (example of the catchment of Ambleville, county 95, France where the nitrate pollution is mainly due to sewers (2012)), has been largely related to the agricultural practices (Sci Total Environ 407:6034–6043, 2009).

The current Abe administration has introduced so-called Farmland Banks to facilitate land transfers to expanding farms, including general corporations, which have long been banned from farmland access in Japan. The paper argues that farmland deregulation puts the ‘incumbent’ local stakeholders of farmland governance, such as local agricultural cooperatives, local administrations, and not least farmers themselves, at risk of losing access to state support and influence. At the same time, the responsibilities for coordinating farmland consolidation have been placed onto the same local stakeholders. The state of local farmland governance has long been critical to impeding coordinated consolidation, whereas deregulation facilitates ‘predatory’ corporate farmland use. In contrast, evidence from Hikawa Town in Shimane Prefecture shows how exceptionally strong local control over farmland enables consolidation—albeit in the ‘defensive’ interests of the local incumbents. © 2016, © 2016 German Institute for Japanese Studies.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed new light on the issue of preference heterogeneity in cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the ideas of Habermas and Luhmann, this paper interprets preference heterogeneity of cooperative members in terms of the precarious relationship between the categories of “system” and “lifeworld.” The argument is buttressed with a case study of an agricultural cooperative recently founded in Central Greece. Findings: The sensitivity of cooperatives to the lifeworld contexts of their members exacts the price in the form of the member preference heterogeneity problem. If this sensitivity is taken to be the constitutive characteristic of cooperatives, then the proposed argument hammers home their fundamental ambivalence, as they are necessarily fraught with the potential for internal conflict. Research limitations/implications: The paper urges for a radical rethinking of Georg Draheim’s thesis of the “double nature” of cooperatives. “Double nature” is shown to aggravate the member preference heterogeneity problem. Practical implications: The results of this study inform the cooperative leaders’ quest to strike a balance between the interests of their members and the demands of the external socio-economic environment. Originality/value: This research contributes significantly to the literature on collective decision-making costs incurred by cooperatives. The failure of cooperatives to balance the sensitivity to members’ interests and to the external environment is exposed as the root cause of the divergence and heterogeneity of member preferences. This heterogeneity is shown to boost collective decision-making costs. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Food security is one of the main goals of rural poor people. To enhance food security in this context, participatory action research can help to ensure sustained success while considering entire food value chains (FVC). This paper assesses the feasibility and potential success of upgrading strategies (UPS) as well as their assessment criteria as developed by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists. The results form part of a larger participatory research project conducted in two climatically representative regions of Tanzania: semi-arid Dodoma and subhumid Morogoro. This paper presents the findings with respect to food processing, waste management and bioenergy, along with income generation and market participation. Assessments on other components of the FVC, including natural resource management, crop production and consumption, are reported by Graef et al (2015). The assessments for food processing revealed preferences for preservation techniques, oil extraction processes and food storage devices for the semi-arid region. In contrast, in the subhumid region, the experts favoured food storage devices and preservation techniques. Assessments of waste management and bioenergy UPS for both regions indicated the importance of animal feed from crop residues, crop residues as mulch and compost from food waste, although with somewhat different priorities. Assessments on income generation and markets in both regions revealed preferences for savings and credit cooperatives and communication techniques, but also indicated that warehouse receipt systems and guarantee systems had a high impact. Assessments differed between the two different climatic regions, and to some extent also between the nationality of experts and their gender. The authors therefore attach importance to integrating different South-North and female-male awareness in assessments among scientists. Moreover, local and/or regional stakeholders and experts should be involved in developing site-adapted UPS for enhancing FVCs.},

The study employs a VRIO (valuable, rare, inimitable and organizational) model for the theoretical conception of constructs related to the resource-based view and competitive advantage. A case study was undertaken in a credit union, incorporating interviews at two levels of organizational management strategic and tactical as well as a questionnaire administered with two managers to identify relevant resources and a review of secondary data consisting of company documents. The study found that only one resource may be considered a generator of sustainable competitive advantage: human capital training. This was considered by the three sources to be valuable, rare, costly to imitate and exploited by the company. Two types of physical capital resources were considered to be generators of temporary competitive advantage: financial capacity and location. These appear in at least two sources, defined as rare and valuable and expensive to copy. Therefore, the organization gains a competitive edge guided by limited resources, namely human and physical capital. These findings provide important insights for the development of further studies, systematizing the resource-based view in a research agenda. This research has implications for academics, practitioners and policy makers. Explains the strategic assets that generate competitive advantage and which are essential for the survival of the company. The realization of the value of human resources for the company studied, emphasizes the importance and necessity of ensuring the satisfaction of the people and investing in training for obtaining sustainable competitive advantage.

    abstract = {In Central‐ and Eastern Europe, the collapse of socialist regimes resulted in a transformation of state‐owned agricultural cooperatives to privately owned lands from the early 1990s onwards. These socioeconomic processes resulted in landscape‐scale changes in biodiversity, ecosystem services and agricultural production. In parallel, large‐scale abandonment of croplands, especially on sandy, salty or frequently inundated areas, became common. Abandoned croplands are usually sensitive to species invasions, and are hotspots of noxious weeds, posing threats both to agriculture and nature conservation. Grassland restoration on former croplands can be an effective strategy for suppressing these species. Thus, a common goal of nature conservation and agriculture can be the restoration of grasslands on former croplands to (1) suppress weed and/or invasive species in line with the policy “Good Farming Practices”, (2) support animal husbandry by creating meadows or pastures, and to (3) recover biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the present paper we report “best practices” of grassland restoration projects from Hungary. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of spontaneous grassland recovery vs. active grassland restoration by seed sowing in terms of the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as weed control and biomass production. Our results showed that grassland restoration on abandoned fields offers a viable solution for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services. Seed sowing ensures higher weed control and biomass production, but results in lower biodiversity compared to spontaneous recovery. Both restoration methods can be cost‐effective, or even profitable even within a relatively short period of a nature conservation project. © 2016, Copyright: © 2016 Valkó et al.},

Using focus groups, a household survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets. Our pilot study suggests that the convergence of grassroots mobilization and political-institutional change is a central leverage point for developing more resilient food systems. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The structural equation modelling technique was employed to seek answer for the question of how value chain integration dimensions are related to performance. The results of the analyses showed the existence of positive relationships between coordination of activities and performance; between joint decision-making and performance at farmers-cooperatives interface; and between commitment towards long-term relationships and performance at farmers-traders interface.

Results showed a large increase in the proportion of beneficiaries accessing extension services from private service providers and expressing satisfaction with CESDM, attaining higher dairy productivity in milk and in gross margins per animal per year. However, there was only a marginal increase in willingness to pay or paying for the services and the majority of beneficiaries continued to sell milk through informal market outlets. On aggregate, CESDM posted positive net benefits and multiplicative economic power with the best performing dairy chains multiplying every shilling invested 4 to 46 times. On average, beneficiaries earned KES 4993 per farmer at a cost of KES 353 for services, inputs and equipment. We conclude that CESDM can be a viable and rewarding approach for delivering extension services to smallholder farmers but it is necessary to strengthen farmer cooperative societies because those paying for private services are still too few to sustain remunerative private sector investment in extension service delivery.},

    abstract = {Upon its triumphant return to power in 2012, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), under the leadership of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, introduced a set of new economic policies popularly called “Abenomics.” One of the main components of the new policy was a drastic reform plan for the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA), the party’s longtime loyal supporter. The announcement of the reform plan invited fierce opposition from the JA, which threatened to end its support of LDP in future elections. Why did Abe introduce the JA reform plan, even though it could lead to loss of electoral support for his party? Is he serious about carrying out the proposed reform plan, or is it just for show? This article analyzes the context of the JA reform plan from the standpoint of constructivist institutionalism focusing on policymakers’ ideas regarding party management.

Some analysts report that 10 per cent or more of property/casualty insurance claims are fraudulent, while less than 20 per cent of fraudulent claims being detected. Consumer attitudes are becoming more tolerant of insurance fraud in recent years. Recognizing that not all insurance fraud situations are created equal, we investigate variability in perceptions of moral intensity in dissimilar insurance padding situations in a 2 (to help others versus to profit self) × 2 (a small credit union versus a large online insurer) model and compared the results between two independent samples (college students/Millennials and an older adult population). We also investigated the impact of ethical predispositions (formalism and utilitarianism) on moral awareness and moral judgment using these four scenarios. The results suggest that the Millennials may exhibit more situationalism and more lenient judgments of collaborative versus unilateral ethical violations. In particular, 'for self' versus 'for others' comparisons show striking differences between the two age groups. The results add to the growing literature in explaining intra-personal variability in moral decision making. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

The case is made that cooperatives can potentially generate higher rates of growth and more equitable growth, even in competitive economic environments. An important type of cooperative that is focused upon is one based on the linking of smaller farms into a cooperative. Economies of scale and scope as well in transaction costs can be captured by the cooperatives. Given cooperative governance, one would also expect higher levels of x-efficiency. Overall, cooperatives can generate relative high incomes to cooperative members, whilst remaining competitive with the traditional privately owned large farms. Critical to the success of the cooperative is a set rules and regulation that place them on a level playing field with the privately owned farm. In addition, the implementation and practice of cooperative principles are key to the success of the cooperative farm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe the extent of agricultural losses incurred by the farm households due to flood; to assess the farm households gender-based vulnerability to flood; to identify the coping strategies used by them; and to estimate factors that drive the choice of these coping strategies. Design/methodology/approach – Using both purposive and simple random sampling techniques, the paper selected 120 farm households from the flood prone areas of the state, using the list of the State Agricultural Development Project (ADP) contact farmers as a sampling frame. Data for the paper were collected using a set of structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The information collected included the extent of agricultural losses incurred by the farm households, farm household’s level of asset base, flood coping strategies adopted by the farmers and so on. The data were collected in August 2013. Findings – More than 70 per cent of the farmers’ farmlands were affected by flood, resulting in more than 80 per cent of their staple crops (cassava, rice, yam, maize and vegetables) and livestock (sheep/goat and chicken) being lost. Women were generally more vulnerable than men to the effect of flood. Selling of assets, borrowing of loans to diversify the means of livelihood, short-term migration, support from social network, compensation of losses from National and/or State Emergency Management Agencies, planting of agro-forestry trees, change of date of planting, land terracing, construction of drainages, cover cropping and making of ridges across slop constituted the flood coping strategies of the farmers. On the factors influencing the choice of these coping strategies, the level of education of the household head, frequency of extension visits in a year and tenure security status were positively and significantly related with land and crop management strategies, such as planting of agro-forestry trees, planting of cover crops and construction of drainages across farmland. Age, access to credit, farm size and membership of cooperative societies had negative relationships with selling of assets and short-term migration. In addition, membership of cooperative societies and flood experience were positively and significantly related with institutional measures, such as support from social network and National and State Emergency Management Agencies. These observations underscore the need for training, cooperatives and enhanced farm capacity (credit and farm size) in coping with flood by the farmers. It is recommended that governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should assist the farmers in these regards. Originality/value – Climate change induced flooding has become a developmental issue across the world. As countries continue to be hit by massive flooding, food production also continues to be hit adversely. Nigeria has joined this league because of the rampage flooding across the country in recent times. Anambra State is down stream of both rivers Niger and Benue and, hence, one of the states vulnerable to flooding in Nigeria. Available literature suggests that greater efforts have been made to quantify the economic implications of flooding on agriculture and the concomitant coping strategies in developed than in developing countries. This paper, therefore, assesses the extent of losses suffered by farm households, their level of vulnerability and flood coping strategies. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effect of nitrogen on oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) yield as well as evaluate the level of nitrogen nutrition based on the value N.N.I. (nitrogen nutrition index). The plot-scale experiment was based in years 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 in terms of agricultural cooperative in Mojmírovce. Hybrid Artoga was seeded. There were three treatments of fertilization and the block method of experimental plot size of 600 m2 in triplicate was used in this experiment. The first treatment was unfertilized control treatment. Other treatments were fertilized by the same dose of nitrogen 240 kg*ha-1. Treatment 3 was fertilized three times during spring and treatment 2 was fertilized except 3 spring doses also in autumn. Results showed that yield of rapeseed was greatly influenced by weather conditions. Both experimental years were not equable in precipitation and temperatures. The highest average yield (at 12% moisture) 3.69 t*ha-1 was reached at treatment 3, where any autumn dose of nitrogen was not applied. It means an increase by 55.04% and 24.66% compared to unfertilized control treatment and treatment 2. Autumn dose of nitrogen did not influence significantly yield of seeds. Values of N.N.I. ranged from 0.71% to 1.25% and there were not observed any significant differences among treatments as well as between experimental years. © 2016, University of Zagreb-Faculty of Agriculture.

Exploratory factor analysis of a set of attitudinal measurement items was used to assess members" attitudes to agricultural cooperatives. Seemingly unrelated regression analysis was used to identify the impact of members" perceptions of agency problems on the attitude measures obtained from the exploratory factor analysis. The results suggest that perceived agency problems significantly explain members" attitudes to their cooperatives. Therefore, working with these problems can be a way for directors of cooperatives to influence members" attitudes and, in continuation, behaviors to these. This would be one way of developing more sustainable member-director relationships in these cooperatives. © 2016 Hakelius and Hansson.},

This problem arises due to the temporal perspective of the cooperated be different of the cooperative organization, because the cooperative members tend to prioritize the projects and the investments that aim to benefit their economic activity in the short term. Methodologically, we chose the mixed method in the execution of search, ie, we were used qualitative and quantitative information. Thus, we sampled 10% of agricultural cooperatives linked to the Organization of Cooperatives of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (OCERGS). It was found that the cooperatives that have the "grains", as the main business activity, presented more intensity of the horizon problem. Most of the variables used to capture this problem showed elevated levels of agreement. It was also observed that the financial condition of the cooperative affects the incidence of the horizon problem. Among the main strategies to minimize this problem are: the distribution of surpluses, the programs of relationships and incentives with the membership and the return of social capital to the cooperated in the cooperative after large period. This study highlights the need to adopt new organizational models for overcoming of the horizon problem, but to achieve this strategy it is necessary to update current legislation taking into account the new environment of agribusiness. © 2015, Universidade de Taubate.

Vale-Agroindustrial Cooperative, compared to the most representative units located in Parana, Brazil, and the ones located in Paraguay. The analyses of the institutional environment were based on the New Institutional Economics, with emphasis on the Douglass North's theory (1990) about the institutions and occurred with in loco interviews in each cooperative unit that was covered by the sample. The analysis of the cultural environment was based on the characterization of the organizational culture of each cooperative unit, according to the Competing Value Model, developed by Cameron and Quinn (1998), that typifies it in group culture, innovative, market and hierarchical, applied to the same managers, through online electronic questionnaire. The analysis of the social environment was based on the theoretical concept of social capital and the respective characteristics identified in the units by adapting the model proposed by the World Bank study group (BM), prepared by Grootaert et al. (2003), through the content analysis of the interviews. As a result to the established problem it was concluded that, even C. Vale being a single cooperative, there are influences of the institutional and the socio-cultural environment in the process of management of the cooperative units in Parana and Paraguay. Finally, according to the grouping proposal of the cooperative units based on the collected data, four specific clusters were identified.},

    abstract = {Case Description: The primary subject matter of this case is information system security. Secondary issues include analyzing the difference between technology security and information system security and examining the role that organizational insiders must play in maintaining information system security. The difficulty level is three, four, and five. This case could be used to supplement or cover an information security chapter in an undergraduate or graduate Introductory to Technology course. As part of a management curriculum, the case is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses. The case could also be used with an individual and group decision making chapter in Principles of Management, Organizational Behavior, and Organization Theory, or chapters which address the planning or controlling functions in Principles of Management. It can be taught in a single 75- minute class with two hours of student preparation outside of class in addition to time needed to read the assigned chapter. CASE SYNOPSIS Organizations face ongoing challenges to develop and maintain comprehensive systems to maintain information security. In order to do so, an understanding of both the technical and social aspects of an information system is necessary. Management must recognize the difference between information and technology security. By definition, an information system consists of (1) the environment, (2) the technology, and (3) the people. To have an adequate information system security strategy all three must be considered. The case involves an information security breach at First Freedom Credit Union. In this case, member credit card information was stolen, not by technological means but rather because of human error. The executives believed that they had adequate information system security, but were taken by surprise when their members' credit card information was stolen. The case addresses the issue of the financial services environment, the technology countermeasures that are currently in place, and the people who are using the information systems. A point is made that information is not only stored within computer-based systems, but is reproduced in the form of printed reports, backup tapes, emails, etc.},

Our analysis focuses on four Moroccan milk collection cooperatives that started using a milk analyzer with the aim of eliminating cheating by their suppliers. The cooperatives' room for maneuver in improving quality management was limited by the presence of competitors for milk collection and by the agro-industry's lack of transparency in the way its own quality controls were applied.

The success of cooperative banks in the past was grounded on efficiency advantages generated through peer-monitoring, social sanctions, and institutional trust. Institutional economic theory and anecdotal historical evidence suggest that these core institutional mechanisms also had an effect on the employment structure of early credit cooperatives. By examining the employment structure of current cooperative banks, we aim to provide insights to the question of how and to what extent original institutional mechanisms of credit cooperatives may still be functional. We use administrative establishment data from Germany and compare employment structures of banks by legal form. The results indicate that cooperative banks in comparison with otherwise similar private and savings banks are characterized by more stable employment, an older workforce, more extensive training activities, and a more homogeneous composition of employees.

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore antecedents and consequences of intra-organizational knowledge hiding. Design/methodology/approach: A model was developed and tested with data collected from 691 knowledge workers from 15 North American credit unions. Findings: Knowledge hiding and knowledge sharing belong to unique yet possibly overlapping constructs. Individual employees believe that they engage in knowledge hiding to a lesser degree than their co-workers. The availability of knowledge management systems and knowledge policies has no impact on intra-organizational knowledge hiding. The existence of a positive organizational knowledge culture has a negative effect on intra-organizational knowledge hiding. In contrast, job insecurity motivates knowledge hiding. Employees may reciprocate negative knowledge behavior, and knowledge hiding promotes voluntary turnover. Practical implications: Managers should realize the uniqueness of counterproductive knowledge behavior and develop proactive measures to reduce or eliminate it. Originality/value: Counterproductive knowledge behavior is dramatically under-represented in knowledge management research, and this study attempts to fill that void. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Yet in the current context of climate change, in which we turn to genetics, irrigation or innovation in cultural practices to maintain production quality, could the mountain environment emerge as a solution for adapting to climate change in vine-growing? Here we explore the role of cooperative policies that may be deployed on the territorial scale, using an agent-based model. Our model was based on the viticulture of the Banyuls-Collioures AOC area, which is characterized by small-scale vine-growers and marked by widespread involvement in cooperative systems. The simulation results showed an important role of cooperative policies not only to conserve narrow production window and required vine quality, but also in respect of the emblematic landscape structure. These results should foster vine-growers to strengthen their cooperatives and adequately use these organizations to mitigate future climate change impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thus, to ensure their survival it is essential to address the challenge of globalization and market orientation. This paper establishes a typology of cooperative exporters based on a sample of 45 Spanish citrus cooperatives and analyses the existence of significant differences between them based on their knowledge of markets, market orientation and innovation. The results show that there are differences in knowledge of markets among those cooperatives that export through second grade cooperatives and those who export directly. Additionally, differences were also significant in innovation and market orientation among cooperatives that exported sporadically and those with an export plan. © 2016, Universidad del Zulia.

    abstract = {Since the 1990s financial sector regulation in Australia has treated credit unions and building societies the same as banks under the designated title of authorized depository institutions. This allows credit unions to choose between different organizational structures: cooperative; convert to customer-owned banks or to demutualize. This article utilizes semi-structured interviews to analyse the key motivations for organizational change. It examines a number of credit unions and their conversion experience to customer-owned banks. It finds that adaptation of the credit union model was necessary to change customer perceptions, ensure future growth in the customer base and assets, and facilitate access to capital raisings with the credit rating of a bank. Despite this change customer-owned banks retain the core principals of mutuality. © 2015 CIRIEC.},

    abstract = {We present a tactical level planning tool to address the issue of coordinating production of perishable specialty crops under decentralized control and incomplete information. The objective of this research is to address an emerging problem seen in the business model of agricultural cooperatives. These vertically expanded farmer associations market their products jointly. However, within the cooperatives farmers remain competitors seeking their own best interest, simultaneously seeking contracts for the most profitable crops in the most desirable part of the season; this behavior can work to the detriment of the group. The model developed considers the problem of asymmetric information and internal competition within the cooperative, as well as traditional factors relevant to agricultural planning. Thereafter, an auction based coordination mechanism is formulated, which leads production decisions toward a coordinated outcome despite each individual acting independently and on his/her best interest. The mechanism is shown to approximate optimal production targets through focused information discovery and a well-structured contract allocation methodology. The results presented show the viability of implementing such planning scheme in practice as well as the optimality gap under a variety of settings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT: This article examines the program of agricultural cooperative (JA) reform initiated by the Abe administration in November 2013 and ending with draft legislation approved by the Diet in August 2015 for enactment in April 2016. The government linked JA reform to its broader program of economic reform in several ways: as an important item on the agenda of regulatory reform; as a ‘trump card’ in the transformation of agriculture into a growth industry; and as a means to strengthen the international competitiveness of the domestic farm industry in order to facilitate further opening of Japan’s agricultural market. The Abe administration also had an additional, political objective in accomplishing JA reform – to weaken the political power of JA as one of the country’s most formidable and influential pressure groups. This article evaluates the nature of the reform program and its success in achieving its wider economic and political objectives. It argues that the reforms to date are both radical and limited. They are radical because they are unprecedented; on the other hand, they are limited because the extent of the change is relatively circumscribed and therefore its potential to achieve the government’s broader economic goals as well as its narrower sectoral goals is relatively modest. © 2016 Japanese Studies Association of Australia.},

    abstract = {Because of the Greek economic crisis, almost all businesses are facing difficult times withsevere consequences for employment and the whole economy. Responding to the economic crisis, the companies cut off investments, wages and reduced personnel. However, the companies have to adapt their business strategies to cope with the crisis. This paper conducts a strategic assessment of the Greek agricultural cooperatives during the first half of 2013 using in-dep interviews withcooperative executives in order to illustrate how they have responded to the crisis and also to investigate their strategic options for the upcoming period. The results of the analysis show that agricultural cooperatives have chosen the retrenchment and cost-cutting strategies by restraining their activities while they appear eager to export their production. In addition, the cash shortage forced them to count exclusively on their members to finance any new economic activity. According to the cooperatives’ executives, their adaption strategies exclude abandoning the activities and selling the equipment and their real estate properties, while they involve exports, the experienced personnel and marketing investments. These results could provide helpful directions not only for the agricultural cooperatives’ management boards but also for the food industry businesses operating under a severe economic situation such as the present Greek economic crisis. © 2016, Agricultural Economics.

The study is informed by cross-disciplinary literature in rural development, specifically, multi-functional agriculture and nested markets. Results show a complex, dynamic terrain where new strategies are emerging within an agricultural sector struggling to survive global free trade policies and neoliberalism. Here, rural tourism is neither a simple, business-orientated project nor a step-by-step process of tourism “development”. It emerges, together with nested markets, in the rural agricultural domain. Farmers, residents and newcomers draw upon historical practices and cultural knowledge to create innovative, quality products and educational experiences that contribute to the sustainability of local agricultural livelihoods and cultural traditions. However, shifts in public sector roles and structural changes in the growth and power of the agriculture cooperatives exacerbate the tensions and conflicts evident within the community in this struggle for rural survival. The study offers possibilities for new forms of “local tourism experience” and nested markets that can contribute to sustainable rural development, and has links to universal key issues of empowerment, control, understanding, markets and product development in rural tourism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

    abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of name change, if any on the financial performance of deposit-taking savings and credit co-operatives (SACCOs) in a developing country characterized by a vibrant SACCO sector. Sparse studies exist on the impact of name changes on revenue-cost performance in mutual financial institutions such as SACCOs. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a standard event methodology over a six-year period (2008-2013) to investigate the impact of name change on the return on assets (ROA) and operating profit margin (OPM). The study then uses a panel regression method to study the impact of name change on ROA and OPM for a sample of 212 deposit-taking SACCOs over the period 2008-2013. Findings: The results, which are robust for a variety of controls, provide evidence in support of a consistent positive association between name change and subsequent financial performance of deposit-taking SACCOs in Kenya. The positive impact of name change seems to be experienced about four years after the name change. The results reveal muted influence of regulation on name change and financial performance of SACCOs in Kenya. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses solely on deposit-taking SACCOs in a developing country context over a six-year period only. Extending the time period and including a sample of control SACCOs operating purely back-office service activities would add power to the analyses. Practical implications: The current study illustrates the contribution of name change on the financial performance of SACCOs in a developing country characterized by a vibrant SACCO sector. Overall, the results show that name change announcements signal an improvement in SACCOs’ future prospects. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the contribution of name change announcements on the financial performance of SACCOs in a developing country context. The study adds to the sparse literature on the impact of name change on the financial performance of mutual financial institutions that are not listed on the securities exchange. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach – The business model is taken as the structure and governance of the relationships between the focal firm and its exchange partners. The empirical analysis is based on a qualitative investigation, analyzing material collected at the Farming Cooperative Gran Cru. Findings – Several different coordination mechanisms were used to rethink the firm customer value proposition, showing a very complex and dynamic inter-organizational system: Process control mechanisms, knowledge suppliers and clan control mechanisms. The combination of mechanisms enables the firm to govern the extreme complexity of external complementarities and interdependence among activities and resources. Practical implications – The study is particularly helpful to managers because wine entrepreneurs and managers can influence their networks’ features and strategies, as well as the mechanisms for governance of the relationships and extracting customer value. Originality/value – The study seeks to enrich the debate on the strategy/structure fit by shifting the focus from the organizational to inter-organizational level of analysis. The analysis centers on boundary-spanning relationships between one wine firm and its partners and knowledge suppliers. This perspective brings business model analysis and inter-organizational design closer because variables of the business model – such as customer value – can be seen as combinations of inter-organizational coordination mechanisms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The value of membership of an agricultural producer cooperative to a farmer is universally understood to include market access, improved bargaining power, and reduced transaction costs. As a result of consolidation in agriculture, many farmers in developed countries have found themselves in complex cooperative structures in which market orientation may elevate capital-related membership benefits over the traditional patronage and farming-related benefits. This study utilized the heterogeneity in producer organization structures to examine the significance to farmers of membership in modern agricultural cooperatives. Survey data including 682 Finnish agricultural producers in the livestock sector enabled the subjective value of cooperative membership and the relationship with transaction cost benefits to be analyzed. The effect of vertical integration in cooperatives on the self-reported value of membership benefits was assessed with a sample consisting of members in three types of cooperative organizations: dairy marketing, dairy supply, and meat cooperatives. The findings confirm that a stable market channel is still the most important benefit that producers perceive as deriving from cooperative membership. Multivariate ordered probit analysis indicated that the market channel is equally appreciated by large and small producers, but the reduced uncertainty brought by a cooperative buyer is particularly valuable to farmers who are investing in farm expansion. The survey findings indicate that the more competition for the raw material from producers there is in an area, the greater is the pressure cooperatives may be under to develop their service offering in order to attract members. © 2015, Alh.},

    abstract = {The study examined the roles of ICTs for improved fish farming and production in Rivers State, Nigeria. The specific objectives were to - describe the socioeconomic characteristics of the responding fish farmers in the area; identify ICT devices used by respondents in the area; examine fish farming/production information needs of respondents; ascertain ICT roles in promoting fish farming and production in the study area; and identify problems of ICTs use by fish farmers in the study area. Multi stage sampling technique was adopted in sample selection. Data were collected with use of questionnaire and interview schedule. The sample size was 150 fish farmers randomly selected from a list of 1500 registered ICT user fish farmers obtained from fish farmers cooperative office in Andoni, headquarters of Zone II. Data were analyzed using descriptive tools such as percentages, presented in tabular forms. Majority, (43.3%) were 41-50 years with a mean age of 42.5 years, 91.3% were males, 76% were married, 63.3% had a family size of 1-4 people. Majority (56%) had secondary education, 50.6% had between 21-30 years in fishing experience. ICT devices used includes mobile phones, radio, television, internet, journals and magazines among. Fish farmers needed information on pond construction, sources of fingerlings, sales and marketing, diseases treatment, weather/temperature an many more. ICTs play the following roles in fish farming: information exchange, knowledge sharing, promotion of education, monitoring illegal fishing and price information provisioning. The challenges facing them includes high cost of device, low level of education, power supply, network problem among others. It was recommended that education and training be given to the farmers by the extension agents, power supply and network services should be improved the various bodies responsible for the services.},

    abstract = {The capital structure of co-operatives can differ from that of IOB (Investor-Owned Businesses) since the two organizations differ in their aims, governance structures and decision-making principles. This paper examines whether the determinants verified in IOB affect the leverage ratio of consumer co-operatives. Consumer co-operatives in South Korea have been rapidly growing during the last decade. There are two leading theories in finance that explain capital structure: the trade-off and pecking order theories. Focusing on consumer co-operatives in South Korea, the paper aims to analyze empirically what determinants have effect on the capital structure of consumer co-operatives and which of the two theories is more plausible. This study reveals that profitability and firm size have a significantly negative effect on leverage while tangibility and growth have a significantly positive effect on it. In conclusion, it seems that neither of the theories above perfectly accounts for the capital structure of consumer co-operatives because of the differences in governance characteristics between consumer co-operatives and IOB as well as in the costs of bankruptcy, agency, informational asymmetry and securities issuance.

    abstract = {The recognition of family farms and agricultural cooperatives as catalysts for agricultural recovery during the perestroika years went along with the rediscovery of the world-famous theoretician of the peasant farm Aleksandr V. Chaianov. The economist’s rehabilitation resulted from the changing conventions of public discourse towards the end of the Soviet era. Yet, Chaianov’s return needs to be linked also with the official image of the rural economy in the preceding decade when in academic and political debates on private subsidiary farms the socialist village took on new contours. Household farming which had previously been condemned as either a ‘petty-bourgeois’ mode of production or an indicator of the incomplete transition to socialism, was accepted as a component of socialist agriculture. Mirroring a new understanding of socialism, this paradigm shift was an important precondition for the broad public response to Chaianov’s rehabilitation. In the end, the turn towards family farming and co-operation remained an intellectual and political phenomenon with barely any impact on the agrarian order itself. The economic legacy of the Soviet era and local power constellations prevented a fundamental change of the rural order in favor of household-based agriculture. © 2021 Institut National de Recherche Pedagogique.

Here we asked whether domestic dogs evaluate humans interacting with one another over neutral objects. In two experimental conditions, the dog's owner tried to open a container to get a junk object that was inside, then requested help from an actor sitting next to her/him, while the dog watched the interaction. In the Helper condition, the actor held the container stable to help the owner to open it. In the Nonhelper condition, the actor turned away and refused to help. In the Control condition, the actor simply turned away in the absence of any request for help. A neutral person sat at the other side of the owner throughout these interactions. After the interaction the actor and the neutral person each offered a piece of food to the dog. Dogs chose food randomly in the Helper and the Control conditions, but were biased against the actor in the Nonhelper condition. The dogs' avoidance of someone who behaved negatively to the owner suggests that social eavesdropping may be shared with a nonprimate species. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

    abstract = {Active membership is crucial for agricultural cooperatives as it engenders better performance. It even is the key for cooperative competitiveness. Active membership, however, decreases in many cooperatives. Thus, it is important to know what galvanizes members to become active members. The cooperative's value and the cooperative's offers motivate some members to become active members, but certainly not all of them. Therefore, more work needs to be done to understand the social attributes that transform members into active members. In this paper the incentives that sustain members' participation over time and the contribution of members' active participation in the cooperative's competitive advantage are studied. Empirical evidence is provided via a questionnaire completed by 241 cooperative members of a Dutch feed supply cooperative and interviews with cooperative experts. Results show that active membership builds on social attributes, such as cooperative culture, open communication, trust, involvement, and the willingness to be active. It is explained that these social attributes create benefits for both the cooperative and its members. Finally, suggestions are presented to stimulate active cooperative membership.},

Various organic farming practices (e.g. integrated rice-duck farming) have been collectively adopted by small-scale rice farmers in Hongdong since 1994. Organic rice farming in Hongdong is characterised by place-based cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, and strong community leadership. Hongdong has demonstrated that communitarianism and smallholder cooperatives can work for each other complementarily and therefore that communitarian organic farming through smallholder cooperatives is highly operational. The Hongdong organic farming model is of great relevance to other parts of rice-growing Asia, which are dominated by smallholding farmers, in terms of the twin goals of food security and food safety. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results highlight the importance of access to and control over land for women to join the cooperative in the first place. Participation intensity is measured through women's participation in collective coffee marketing and share capital contributions. It is found that duration of membership, access to extension services, more equal intrahousehold power relations, and joint land ownership positively influence women's ability to commit to collective action. These findings demonstrate the embeddedness of collective action in gender relations and the positive value of women's active participation for agricultural-marketing cooperatives. © 2015 IAFFE.},

Using women's narratives emerging from interviews and focus group discussions, the gendered assumptions behind women's community-based peacebuilding activities, and implications for women's sustained participation in peace work, are examined. The findings reveal that this model of peacebuilding relied on educating and training women but neglected to explore the structural inequalities that cause violence. Indeed, the expectation placed on women's savings and credit co-operative members to perform unremunerated and sustained peace work in their communities may itself reflect inequalities of power that community-based peace models need to address. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2015 All rights reserved.},

Due to climate change and policy fragmentation household food security and nutrition remain a perpetual challenge, especially for women eking out a living on the periphery. One of the premises that this paper is based on is the assumption that women are prime producers of their communities’ food, which is mainly for food security. Inqolobane Yobumbano Secondary Co-operative (IYSC) could be seen as an initiative that entrenches this role, adding to the burden of women’s care work and ‘subordination’. Contradictorily, the initiative offers women the opportunity to transform this role, empowering them and enabling them to take control of their lives in many ways. Issues pertaining to food security and insecurity are intertwined with women’s struggle for land, which mirrors the unfinished business in post-apartheid South Africa. The case of IYSC is used to interrogate opportunities and challenges besetting the efforts of mainly women in Inanda township. The Secondary Co-Operative is an apex co-operative body formed in 2013 and it has four primary co-operatives. This association was formed with the primary purpose of improving the functioning of agricultural co-operatives within the Inanda area in dealing with food insecurity, poverty, unemployment and inequality. © 2017 Ndwakhulu Tshishonga.},

The main aim of this paper is to analyze the development of the capital structure and capital disparity across the farmers' cooperatives from fourteen regions of the Czech Republic for time series 2009 - 2013. For this analysis is used the debt leverage indicators and method of comparative statics. Data are obtained and processed from the database of enterprises of Albertina. The financial and economic crisis lowered the debt to equity ratio and debt to assets ratio and the profitability ratios as well and the indicators reports V-shaped trend. The disparity of the ratio values among regions at the end of the monitored period seems not to be changed. Usually Prague as the region with the highest GDP per capita during the monitored period reports usually the extreme values in most ratios and higher deviations in debt ratios and lower deviations in profitability ratios. Also the impact of capital structure indicators on the profitability of cooperatives seems to be not significant during the monitored period.},

Nevertheless co-operative performance is affected by pervasive incentive problems. CUMA history suggests how social capital is a critical resource in overcoming some incentive problems. The CUMAs succeeded in creating effective co-operatives through the development of a dense fabric of relations: (i) among the family farmers' members within their local co-operatives; (ii) between the local co-operatives; and (iii) through their network with a multiplicity of actors. Some lessons from this cooperative experience can be broadly useful to governments and development practitioners to help unlock the family farming potential in developing countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The application of a maturity model to 15 credit unions in North America revealed that an overall level of KM maturity is at an early stage of development, but there are signs of future improvement. Credit unions operate in a highly competitive, knowledge-intensive financial industry and experience various pressures to increase their efficiency, which they can achieve through the implementation of KM solutions. Despite the absence of official KM strategies, KM projects were introduced locally in order to fill particular knowledge gaps. The availability of IT infrastructure and the implementation of KM-related technologies alone are insufficient to ensure universal success of organizational KM activities. Credit union managers periodically access and use academic research in their decision making. At the same time, they prefer accessing scholarly knowledge in translated form from books, practitioner magazines, and consultants. It was concluded that organizations competing in the knowledge-intensive sector have an inner need for KM solutions. © 20162015 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The framework associates the specific principles that define the identity of cooperative organizations (self-help, member ownership, democratic control, financial participation, limited capital remuneration) alongside more general governance levels (embodied values, property rights, control, resource allocation). We then apply the same dimensions to production networks and propose a stylized networking model for cooperatives. We introduce market power, and identify two polarized types of networks: (1) heterarchical forms of coordination based on cooperation and mutual help, (2) hierarchical coordination based on exclusive direction. We compare both types with our normative framework providing examples and brief case studies for each network type. Recommendations to scholars and practitioners point at the opportunity to discriminate inter-firm relations and production development strategy in terms of the values of cooperation, at all governance levels. Die erweiterte Governance von genossenschaftlichen Unternehmen: Koordination zwischen den Unternehmen und Übereinstimmung der Werte: Mit diesem Beitrag wird bezweckt, einen Rahmen für die Analyse der Governance in Netzwerken genossenschaftlicher Unternehmen zu schaffen. Die Arbeit basiert auf vier Literaturbereichen: Genossenschaftswesen, Transaktionskosten, Monopolkapitalismus und Produktionsnetzwerke. Der von uns entwickelte Rahmen verbindet die spezifischen Prinzipien miteinander, die, neben allgemeineren Governance-Kategorien (verkörperte Werte, Eigentumsrechte, Kontrolle, Ressourcenallokation), die Identität genossenschaftlicher Organisationen definieren (Selbsthilfe, Unternehmen im Eigentum der Mitglieder, demokratische Kontrolle, finanzielle Beteiligung, begrenzte Kapitalrendite). Sodann wenden wir dieselben Kriterien auf Produktionsnetzwerke an und schlagen ein stilisiertes Netzwerkmodell für Genossenschaften vor. Anschließend führen wir das Phänomen der Marktmacht ein und identifizieren zwei Extrempositionen von Netzwerktypen: (1) "heterarchische" Koordinationsformen, die auf Kooperation und gegenseitiger Hilfe basieren, und (2) hierarchische Koordination, die auf exklusiver Anweisungsbefugnis basiert. Wir vergleichen beide Typen mit unserem normativen Rahmen, wobei wir für jeden Netzwerktyp Beispiele und kurze Fallstudien bringen. Unsere Empfehlungen an Wissenschaftler und Praktiker zeigen die Möglichkeit auf, bei den Beziehungen zwischen den Unternehmen und bei den Produktionsentwicklungsstrategien eine Unterscheidung in Bezug auf die genossenschaftlichen Werte vorzunehmen, und die, für jegliche Governance-Kategorie. La gobernanza de las empresas cooperativas: la coordinación entre empresas y la coherencia de los valores: Este trabajo trata de proporcionar un marco para el análisis de la gobernanza de redes de empresas cooperativas. Se basa sobre cuatro pilares de la literatura: la cooperación, los costes de transacción, el capitalismo monopolístico y las redes de producción. Los autores asocian a estas dimensiones los principios específicos que definen la identidad de las organizaciones cooperativas (autoasistencia, propiedad de los miembros, control democrático, participación financiera y remuneración limitada del capital), al mismo tiempo que niveles de gobernanza mas general (valores incorporados, derechos de propiedad, control y asignación de recursos). Los autores aplican entonces las mismas dimensiones a las redes de producción y proponen un modelo para las cooperativas. A continuación presentan el poder de mercado e identifican dos tipos polarizados de redes: (1) formas heterogéneas de coordinación basadas en la cooperación y en la ayuda mutua, (2) coordinación jerárquica basada en la dirección exclusiva. Se comparan estos dos tipos con el marco normativo de referencia, proporcionando ejemplos y breves estudios del caso para cada tipo de red. Las recomendaciones a los especialistas y a los expertos muestran la oportunidad de hacer distinciones en las relaciones entre las empresas y la elaboración de una estrategia de desarrollo de la producción en términos de valores de cooperación a todos los niveles de gobernanza. La gouvernance étendue des entreprises coopératives: la coordination entre entreprises et la cohérence des valeurs: Ce travail vise à fournir un cadre pour l'analyse de la gouvernance de réseaux d'entreprises coopératives. Il se base sur quatre piliers de la littérature: la coopération, les coûts de transaction, le capitalisme monopolistique et les réseaux de production. Ils associent à ces dimensions les principes spécifiques qui définissent l'identité des organisations coopératives (auto-assistance, propriété des membres, contrôle démocratique, participation financière, rémunération limitée du capital) en même temps que des niveaux de gouvernance plus générale (valeurs incorporées, droits de propriété, contrôle, allocation des ressources). Les auteurs appliquent alors les mêmes dimensions aux réseaux de production et proposent un modèle stylisé de réseautage pour les coopératives. Ils introduisent ensuite le pouvoir de marché et identifient deux types polarisés de réseaux : (1) formes hétérarchiques de coordination basée sur la coopération et l'aide mutuelle, (2) coordination hiérarchique basée sur la direction exclusive. Ils comparent les deux types avec leur cadre de référence normatif en fournissant des exemples et de brèves études de cas pour chaque type de réseau. Les recommandations aux spécialistes et aux praticiens montrent l'opportunité de faire des distinctions entre les relations inter-entreprises et l'élaboration d'une stratégie de développement de la production en termes de valeurs de coopérations à tous les niveaux de gouvernance.

Among various revolutions country has come across, there is a prominence for the industrial revolution for bringing power loom sector and mill sector in place, however this development on one hand has led to the downfall of the handloom fabric industry. Following agriculture, handloom is the second largest sector in terms of employment, as it provides direct and indirect employment for about 43 lakh weavers and associated employees. This sector contributes nearby 15percent of the cloth production in the country. Handloom industry is very powerful in terms of exclusivity, production flexibility, scope of novelty and modernization, meeting the requirement of the suppliers promptly and such wealthy prospects in weaving tradition (Ministry of Textiles 2015). The aim of the study is to know the influence of demographic variables like gender, age, educational qualification, occupation and annual income on customer satisfaction towards handloom products. © 2015, North Carolina State University.

    abstract = {There are more than one million agricultural cooperatives members in Iran. In the meantime, the rapid development of the animal husbandry in Iran has forced cooperatives to meet the members’ scientific and practical needs for completing production cycle of the dairy industry. Livestock production covers a wide spectrum of livestock activities including bee keeping, silkworm raising, and aquaculture, indicating widespread business systems in Iranian animal husbandry. Due to significant livestock population, various animal products, such as raw milk, red meat, white meat (chicken and fish), eggs, and honey are produced. Thus, the mentioned cooperatives need to meet the markets demands for keeping competitive advantage more than any time before. Only when innovation is fostered, market competitive advantage can be maintained. Today, sustainability and innovation issues have a great importance in some organizations such as agriculture cooperatives. The term “entrepreneurship” is coined to describe this need to keep organizations in competitive situation by innovations tools. Presently, it is believed that entrepreneurship can be developed. Organizational, personal, and environmental aspects are important factors toward entrepreneurship fostering. This study took into consideration three factors in cooperatives, including structure, strategy, and leadership.The results of research revealed that these three variables play important role in entrepreneurship development in cooperatives. Thus, consideration of these aspects can help in development and boost cooperatives profits. The result of modeling by structural equations methods showed that 38% of the variance of entrepreneurship as a dependent variable could be explained by these three factors in cooperatives. © 2015 Tarbiat Modares University.

Considering that SACCOs in Kenya lack the necessary resources to acquire the best information systems, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate MISs currently in use in the SACCO subsector to determine how well they are serving. Design/methodology/approach: Using the ISO/EC 25010 Software Product Quality Model, the quality of MISs operated by 215 Deposit-Taking SACCOs in the Kenya was evaluated to determine their level of performance. Findings: The results indicated that the MISs currently in use by the SACCOs serve them well in terms of functionality, efficiency, reliability, ease of use and portability. However, vendor support, technical training and implementation process are a big concern to the SACCOs. Practical implications: The SACCOs in Kenya need not look for other MISs as the ones in use satisfied the condition required by the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Product Quality Model. The areas that require attention are vendor support services by entering into contracts technical training and service level agreement; and good project management in software implementation. Originality/value: The research addresses itself to one of the biggest setbacks faced by a fast growing subsector in adopting ICT with limited capacity and infrastructure. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Objective – The aim of this paper is to relate Stakeholder Management Capability (SMC) to economic-financial and social-environmental performance. Design/methodology/approach – Data collection occurred in 26 states and the Federal District of Brazil. There was validation of 171 questionnaires answered at the strategic and tactical levels in the context of cooperatives in 13 sectors of Brazil’s economy. Structural equation modeling was used as an application to verify the data with the use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings – The results made it possible to verify the relationship between SMC and the social and environmental performance. The coefficient found for the relationship between SMC and economicfinancial performance also had a positive effect. Practical implications – The research results provide evidence that SMC is directly related to the economic-financial and socialenvironmental performance of cooperative organizations. SMC may also contribute to the analytical process of organizations from the statistical dimension and an applied empirical structure. Originality/value – The model reached support in both relationships with significant values, demonstrating that the dimensions and scales used to measure it were satisfactory, validating the proposed model. This finding demonstrates that these organizations have the skills to meet the requirements of and manage stakeholders, even if one person plays different roles, i.e. the cooperative member, which is basically the owner, supplier, consumer and customer. © FECAP.},

    abstract = {Case Description: The primary subject matter of this case is information system security. Secondary issues include analyzing the difference between technology security and information system security and examining the role that organizational insiders must play in maintaining information system security. The difficulty level is three, four, and five. This case could be used to supplement or cover an information system security chapter in an undergraduate or graduate Introductory to Technology course. As part of a management curriculum, the case is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses. The case could also be used with an individual and group decision making chapter in Principles of Management, Organizational Behavior, and Organization Theory, or chapters which address the planning or controlling functions in Principles of Management. It can be taught in a single 75- minute class with two hours of student preparation outside of class in addition to time needed to read the assigned chapter. Case Synopsis: Organizations face ongoing challenges to develop and maintain comprehensive systems to maintain information security. In order to do so, an understanding of both the technical and social aspects of an information system is necessary. Management must recognize the difference between information and technology security. By definition, an information system consists of (1) the environment, (2) the technology, and (3) the people. To have an adequate information system security strategy all three must be considered. The case involves an information system security breach at First Freedom Credit Union. In this case, member credit card information was stolen, not by technological means but rather because of human error. The executives believed that they had adequate information system security, but were taken by surprise when their members' credit card information was stolen. The case addresses the issue of the financial services environment, the technology countermeasures that are currently in place, and the people who are using the information systems. A point is made that information is not only stored within computer-based systems, but is reproduced in the form of printed reports, backup tapes, emails, etc.},

For this purpose, 263 valid questionnaires were collected from a research sample comprised of co-operants of the biggest dairy union of co-operatives in Iberia. Findings – CR has a significant impact on co-operatives members’ loyalty and on co-operatives’ performance. The model provides a wider comprehension of the CR concept and introduces both the drivers and consequences. Research limitation – This investigation is based on a sample of members of one union of co-operatives in the specific dairy milk industry. Practical implication – The results give new guidelines to redress the co-operatives traditional management, namely the management of intangible assets like reputation. Internal culture, satisfaction with management, image and communication can boost reputation and thus organizational performance and members’ loyalty.

    abstract = {The authors undertake the first econometric study of efficiency for Eroski, the largest member of the Mondragon group of worker cooperatives. Three types of stores are found within Eroski: 1) cooperatives with significant employee ownership and voice; 2) cooperatives with modest employee ownership and limited voice (known as GESPAs); and 3) conventional stores with no employee ownership. Key data are monthly observations - 9,800 for supermarkets and 2,150 for hypermarkets (large superstores combining supermarkets and department stores). By estimating first-difference models, the authors find that hypermarket stores with cooperative ownership have significantly faster sales growth than do GESPA stores. For supermarkets overall, they find no significant differences in performance among the three types of stores. For a subgroup of small supermarkets, however, cooperatives outperform conventional stores. To investigate the mechanisms that help explain why cooperatives perform better, the authors provide additional evidence that takes into account the more extensive opportunities for employee involvement, training, and stronger economic incentives in cooperatives. While cooperative members are better paid than peers in comparable firms, individual data show that job satisfaction is lower for cooperative workers than for GESPA workers. Though this may reflect higher worker expectations in cooperatives, alternatively cooperatives may constitute a "high-stress work system." © The Author(s) 2014},

Special attention is paid to community-based organic agriculture as a pathway to rural development. The Philippines has two decades of experience of community-based natural resource management. Unlike public natural resources such as forests, watersheds or fisheries, however, the community-based organic agriculture programme is intended to deal with the private property regime. Thus, if the programme is to be successful, agrarian land reform must continue. Integrated rice- duck farming is among the suitable and viable options for organic agriculture, given that rice is a major agricultural crop and duck meat is popular in the Philippines. Area-based organic food certification systems need to be formulated and a government-farmers partnership should be forged to facilitate farmers' access to domestic and international organic food markets.},

Common and different features of principles of credit cooperative formation in Europe, USA, Latin America, and Asian-Pacific region are viewed. Experience of development of agricultural credit cooperation of Russia and its involvement in international cooperation programs are studied. As a research method, systemic approach to study of historical experience of organization of agricultural credit cooperation, as well as comparative, structural, and functional analysis, was used. It was determined that systems of agricultural credit cooperation, which develop in a sustainable manner, showed extraordinary feasibility in various manifestations of economic crises due to them being built on the basis of existing horizontal ties of shareholders and formation of effective management system, built on practical implementation of principles of ethical economy. Appearance and aggravation of internal contradictions in the system of agricultural credit cooperation are viewed. The authors come to the conclusion that these contradictions have deeper basis than peculiarities of national economy and are connected to differences between principal theoretical preconditions of emergence and development of credit cooperation. Various interests which lie in the basis of emergence of specific cooperative associations come to the surface of economic reality as initial factors, which, in the process of development, show their contradiction to general tendencies of development of national economy, tendencies in the global division of labor, and global competition in conquering markets for sales of agricultural products.},

    abstract = {Purpose – The business environment of the EU dairy sector has altered drastically because of changes in EU agricultural and trade policy, consumer demand, and innovations since the turn of the millennium. This created new market income opportunities for dairy processors, but also fostered the necessity for investments to access these markets. A literature review sees cooperatives to be disadvantaged at this point, because their organisational structure hinders their access to external financial resources. Confronted with these equity constraints, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how German dairy marketing cooperatives adapted to the new business environment and have been performing from 2000 to 2012. Design/methodology/approach – An approach combining descriptive data from public sources and financial ratio analysis was used to test hypotheses, derived from Transaction Cost Theory. Findings – Contrary to assumptions, cooperatives gained market shares on the German dairy market. However, dairy cooperatives managed to overcome the internal equity constraints only partially via mergers, which intensified structural change. Focusing on cost leadership, German cooperatives were not able to successfully diversify their product portfolio and still operate mainly in the fluid, low margins dairy market segments. Frustrated by their diminishing influence on the decision making process in the vastly grown cooperatives, a majority of farmers cancelled their cooperative membership. Practical implications – Until today an absolute turning point for the cooperative organisational form has not yet occurred, but if cooperatives do not find the means to invest more heavily in the new markets, a slow decline of cooperatives is expected. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the existing literature on marketing cooperatives by providing insights on the performance of cooperatives through combination of from theory derived assumptions with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The objectives of the paper are to construct a mathematical model that provides a rigorous foundation for the TIER approach, modify the approach so the rate of return on equity is a function of the cooperative’s equity position, demonstrate how elements of the model can be used by RECs in setting electric rates that will enable them to accelerate the retirement of member equity, and derive a generalized form of the “modified Goodwin formula” that can be used by both RECs and agricultural cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach – Mathematical and graphical expressions of the TIER approach are developed. Simulations are used to demonstrate how RECs can set electric rates according to a target revolving period. The modified Goodwin formula is generalized to include the payment of cash patronage refunds through use of a growth model of an agricultural cooperative developed in Royer (1993). Findings – This paper demonstrates how TIER analysis and the modified Goodwin formula can be used by cooperatives to aid their decisions regarding debt and equity financing and their choices regarding cash patronage refunds, equity retirement, and growth. The paper demonstrates that cooperatives that fail to recognize the functional relationship between the rate of return on equity and the equity position may substantially underestimate the equity position necessary to meet interest coverage requirements and overestimate their ability to grow and retire equity. It also shows that RECs may be able to make substantial improvements in equity revolvement with only modest increases in electric rates. Research limitations/implications – The model developed in this paper has been simplified to focus on fundamental financial relationships. To apply this model, cooperatives may need to modify it to accommodate the complexities of their business operations. Practical implications – TIER analysis can provide a useful equity management and planning tool for both RECs and agricultural cooperatives. It also can be used by lending institutions to assess the financial health of individual cooperative organizations. Originality/value – Constructing a mathematical model that provides a foundation for TIER analysis, modifying the approach so that the rate of return on equity is a function of the equity position, demonstrating how RECs can use the model to set electric rates according to a target revolving period, and generalizing the modified Goodwin formula so it can be used by agricultural cooperatives are all original contributions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Based on data from 412 households, this study used the sustainable livelihoods approach to analyse changes in livelihood strategies and the relationship between those changes and rural household attitudes in an eastern coastal region of China. Focussing on household off-farm employment decisions and land transfer decisions, we classified the households into six types based on their livelihood strategies, namely, off-farm employment-oriented, balanced, off-farm, idle, professional, and conventional. The survey results indicate that two capital factors, age and education, and two mediating factors, wage and crop prices, are important influences of off-farm employment decisions, whereas factors such as policies and subsidies, machinery, activities organized by local agricultural cooperatives, and land rent substantially influence land transfer decisions. By analysing the characteristics, trends and driving factors of livelihood transitions, i.e., changes in rural household livelihood strategies, from 1993 to 2013, we explored the mechanisms of livelihood transitions. The results indicate that the proportion of conventional households decreased and the proportion of off-farm employment-oriented households and off-farm households increased. Agricultural production transformed from a system of scattered households (conventional and off-farm employment-oriented households) into broad-scale management households (professional and balanced households). These changes were the main characteristics of livelihood transitions under rapid industrialization combined with rapid urbanization in the Qingpu district. Rural livelihood transitions exhibited a stepped pattern, going through an initial stage, a self-organizing stage, and a government-led stage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to investigate the effect of cooperative societies on household food security in six villages of Northern Ethiopia. Cooperative societies have significant contribution to the food security and poverty reduction. However, limited empirical studies exist in the study areas about the roles of cooperative societies on food security. Design/methodology/approach – Primary cross-sectional data were collected from randomly selected 400 households. The study also gathered secondary data from the cooperative associations and government offices for comparison purposes. The paper applied Heckman two-stage model to capture the effect of cooperative societies on household food security. Findings – The probability of the households to join cooperative societies and also ensure food security depends on various determining factors like institutional factors, demographic variables and rural functions. The paired sample t-test shows that the mean income and expenditure of the cooperative member households were 70 and 40 per cent higher in 2010 and 2011, respectively, than in the baseline. The two-sample independent t-test indicates that the mean income and expenditure of the member households were 47 and 32 per cent higher than the counterpart households. The Heckman model explains that cooperative societies have statistically significant, positive and robust effects on household food security at 1 per cent level. Research limitations/implications – A few variables might suffer from endogeneity problem, although theoretically insignificant and have no sound justification. The study also considers only two indicators of food security (income and expenditure), but the findings of the study would have been good and sound with several and composite food security index. Practical implications – Such impact studies on cooperative societies are limited in the study areas. Thus, this study helps decision-makers, cooperative analysts and other concerned bodies to give priority for cooperative societies so as to curtail the food insecurity problem. It can also make meaningful contributions to bridge the gap in the cooperative literature. Social implications – The present study can improve the understanding of cooperative societies in the country. The finding of this paper can serve as an input for university students, decision-makers and cooperative analysts. The result can also strengthen the economic justification for policy intervention on cooperative societies. Originality/value – Most studies in the areas address the financial performance, historical movement and opportunities and challenges of cooperative societies. This implies that more work is necessary to obtain a clear picture and broad spectrum about cooperative societies, and thus, this study addresses the effect of cooperative societies on household food security. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the financial sustainability of Tanzanian saving and credit cooperatives (SACCOs). Design/methodology/approach - The data set used in this study comes from SACCOs' audited financial reports for the year 2011. The performance was estimated using return on asset (ROA) and financial sustainability was estimated using the ratio of total expenses to total revenue. Linear regression was used to investigate the determinants of financial sustainability. Findings - The results show that, about 61 per cent of the sample SACCOs is operationally sustainable and 51 per cent of the total sample is both operationally and financially sustainable. The average sustainability score was 127 per cent. On average, the results for profitability (measured by ROA) is higher than some of the results reported for standard microfinance in the region and globally. In terms of sustainability the result forecasts a promising future for financial cooperative business model as an alternative form of financing the poor. Research limitations/implications - Only SACCOs with audited financial statements were included in the study, thus the conclusion is limited to SACCOs with similar characteristics. Future work might consider extending the analysis to include SACCOs with non-audited financial statements. Practical implications - Based on the sample SACCOs can under good management can be used as a sustainable social conduit for financial access and social economic development among the poor in Tanzania. Originality/value - This study contributes in two ways. First, it contributes towards the scanty empirical literature on the performance of SACCOs in developing countries and in Tanzania in particular. Second, it provides provocative evidence which appears to contradict earlier and more pessimistic accounts and it challenges the ontology about extending member-based microfinance. Copyright © 2015.

    abstract = {This article explores the processes by which gender is given meaning through social interaction in boardrooms. In Norway, alongside mandatory quotas regulating the composition of Public Limited Company boards, voluntary quotas were designed to increase women's membership on the boards of agricultural co-operatives. This radical step to secure a minimum of 40 per cent women makes these boards an interesting site for investigating the construction of gender in a traditionally male-dominated organization. In the debate, arguments in favour of a quota accentuated diversity and differences between women's and men's competences, opinions and values. The analysis of interview data from the boards of four agricultural co-operatives suggests that equal representation is a muted, taken-for-granted value. Equality and diversity are not understood as incompatible ideas, and gender is produced dynamically through practice rather than constituted as an inherent, fixed attribute. Gender as difference is less pervasive than expected as women tend to be recognized as belonging to the gender-neutral category of a board representative despite any recognized differences. The study demonstrates that voluntary quotas may change the context and both challenge old assumptions and promote new understandings of gender in local situations. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Through this analysis, I show that the movement's administration of a democratically managed form of agricultural production exemplifies a unique form of social movement resistance – namely, what I call self-governmental resistance. Rather than reformist or revolutionary contention, self-governmental resistance – performed by movements like the MST – redevelops state policies by vying for and often taking control over the design and implementation of agricultural production. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

We find that in the case of the cooperative types of MFIs, increases in average loan sizes are associated with decreases in female participation in the administration and governance. Further, the findings demonstrate that with increases in the participation of women borrowers, the number of women in organizational governance also increases. These findings suggest important research and practical implications regarding women’s empowerment through participation in mutual cooperative societies. We conclude that credit unions and cooperatives could be an effective tool for enhancing women’s participation in organizational administration and governance. © 2014, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

The results highlight the fact that it might be possible to find a balance between cooperative and capitalist logics, by implementing an appropriate governance structure.

    abstract = {Prior to 2007, Uganda pursued a centralized strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction that placed greater emphasis on agricultural development as a means for empowering citizens in the rural sector where 80% of the population lives and derives livelihood through various forms of subsistence farming. Since coming to power in 1986, the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Government has pursued various policies such as Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) approach under the Prosperity for All (PFA) program. Instead of enriching all Ugandans, the PFA program has benefited few individuals who are politically well-connected to the ruling elite. Based on a historical comparative analysis of impact studies of MFIs and SACCOs in Uganda, we are inclined to further argue that the program has failed to stimulate economic development and reduce chronic poverty because its activities and operations have excluded the rural people who need them the most. Unlike traditional SACCOs that are owned and controlled by their members and rely on member savings and share capital, political SACCOs rely almost entirely on government loans channeled through the Microfinance Support Center (MSC) and Uganda Post Bank. The poor performance of rural credit programs in Uganda is attributed to widespread corruption and politicization of their operations. The greatest challenge facing political SACCOs in Uganda is how best to protect themselves from direct government control, while continuing to receive government funding.},

While state deregulation of the agricultural sector did not mean that all forms of associational support for farmers were lost, farmers there faced a more precarious position. A general decline in farming has resulted in significant changes in the nature of land utilisation. Mining and game farming have become the district’s economic mainstay. This article also highlights shifts away from communal, inter-personal forms of organisation within co-operatives well before the official coming of the neo-liberal epoch. None the less, the scope of decision-making by co-operative management was limited by the oversight of the Ministry of Agriculture, which functioned as a safety net of sorts, but also considered that the interests of ordinary farmers were best upheld by co-operatives remaining non-profit entities. © 2015 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.},

In the context of a digitally organized society, a person's status is created through his or her ability to provide certain status markers to authenticate who they are. Status is created through a person's file, and those lacking an online profile become thin-filed and therefore excluded from many online services. The article argues that digital authentication is a feature of the formation of status in a digitally organized society. Without online system files, individuals lack the power to access public services, banks, credit unions, and e-commerce, and they feel a lack of social honor because of their low authentication status. © 2015 (Bridgette Wessels).},

This study was conducted with accounting data provided by the Central Bank of Brazil, which derives only from individual cooperatives, i.e. singular credit unions. Quarterly financial statements from these credit unions that were active from 1995 to the second quarter of 2009 were employed, totaling 71,325 observations for 1,929 credit unions. Based on survival and the model of competing risks (such as the Cox, Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, and Competing Risk models), the results show that there is no statistical evidence to ensure a correlation between profitability and credit union survival. The results also suggest that the size of credit unions plays a key role in their survival and longevity and that their funding and investment management are related to their survival and risk of market exit. In conclusion, the results confirm the initial idea that the duality inherent to credit unions - cooperative principles versus economic efficiency - might influence the stability, survival, and longevity of these institutions. Such results may also imply that a credit union embracing the rationale of a private bank will become more estranged from its members, something which will hinder its future operations and increase the likelihood of its exit from the market.},

In this article, first, I discuss the importance of cooperatives as organizational forms, particularly the rural producers’ cooperatives (RPCs); second, analyze the research trends within the organizational behaviour (OB) area in the last one-and-half decade on RPCs; third, chart out directions for future research. The analysis suggests that cooperatives as organizational forms throw up special challenges to the OB researchers, as they are special types of organizations that incorporate business-like features of the investor-owned firms as well as the voluntary nature of nonprofits, thereby increasing the complexity of the context to make it an interesting area of research. For future research, OB researchers will have to go beyond the employee-centric research to include cooperative members as important constituent of the organization, specifically focussing on trust, commitment, organizational citizenship behaviour and leadership behaviour. The article identifies certain roadblocks in getting the attention of the researchers in the OB area and suggests certain ways to overcome these roadblocks. © 2015 Institute of Rural Management},

In this case study, we examined how policy changes in China over the past 60 years have influenced indigenous resource management institutions designed to manage common pool pastoral systems in eastern Inner Mongolia. Based on semi-structured interviews (. n=. 91), focus group discussions (64 participants involved), and participant observation, we found that for over half a century rescaling efforts by the Chinese government shifted the focus to national level development planning, which led to the degradation of indigenous institutions that managed common pool pastoral systems in the region. However, we also highlight how local actors have used recent changes in government policies to revitalize traditional herding institutions.

Previously understudied, these organizations have also been ignored or forgotten in the dominant narratives and spaces of commemoration. This further limits what we know about the past and the potential of alternative organizations. To illustrate this problem, we offer a specific case study of the forgotten alternative organizations and marginalized space of a former Finntown alongside the commemorative narratives and practices of capitalist entrepreneur heritage spaces. Extending organization theory on memory and forgetting, we detail how commemoration not only tends to legitimate capitalist forms of organizing, but also excludes alternatives. Finntowns, with their emphasis on cooperative organizations and community, provide a unique opportunity for organization studies to explore commemoration and forgetting in terms of power relations, time, and space. These marginalized spaces contained alternative organizations coexisting and contrasting with dominant capitalist organizations. Remembering their contributions means taking alternative organizations seriously, acknowledging their historic importance as well as their ability to be models for contemporary organizations. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.},

    abstract = {Very few women's co-operatives exist in Europe today; of those that do, the vast majority are involved in non-agricultural sectors. For the past thirty years in Greece, numerous women's agricultural co-operatives have been established in rural areas and scholars have articulated several aspects of their role in both women's life and the local development. A cursory glance at the history of the women's agricultural co-operatives in Greece and a review of the literature highlights the uniqueness of this type of entrepreneurship (a rarity in Europe) and their significant role for rural society cohesion, mainly in geographically and economically isolated rural areas. In this paper we employ a SWOT analysis to elaborate on strengths and weaknesses, which vary from co-operative to co-operative. Either bottom-up or top-down created women's co-operatives are currently a social innovation. Their strengths mainly concern economic independence and social inclusion of women in rural areas, while their weaknesses are mainly associated with funding, organization, administration, know how, culture, product promotion and marketing problems. Nevertheless, they are called upon to survive in a competitive environment; although difficult, it is one that provides opportunities that most likely can outweigh threats. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

This is achieved through a number of activities, some of which are introduced here in detail.

    abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess the gaps in the adoption of crop insurance in Thailand and suggest possible solutions relating to policy support and framework, implementation mechanisms, technology adoption, and awareness amongst farmers. The methodology includes a literature review, interaction with officials, rice experts and insurance experts, and discussion with farmers. A study was undertaken at province level to assess the impact of using rainfall index as a threshold. Additionally, focused group discussions (FGD) were conducted with rice farmers at the village level. Key issues targeted in the FGD were to understand the behavior and practices during droughts, impact of drought on crop yield, methods already in use to reduce the impact, such as plantation of drought-resistant rice, and the adoption of crop insurance. Data availability is a challenge and has led to withdrawal ofWeather Index Insurance (WII) in 2015. WII have threshold levels based on historical rainfall. Adoption of coping mechanisms, such as drought-resistant rice and irrigation increases the chances of adverse selection. In absence of ground based weather data, a combination of satellite agriculture drought information can be used to make crop insurance more attractive as it would help in reducing basis risk and improving insurers and farmers' confidence in the product. Discussion with farmers, insurance companies, and the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) in Thailand suggested low awareness among farmers about the potential benefits of weather index insurance products. Relatively low compensation is also an obstacle. Proper marketing and awareness raising campaigns should also accompany the introduction of index-based insurance products. © 2016 by the author.},

These uses may stand in competition with one another, and we test if violence affects the awarding of concessions or land grants. We analyze district-level, GIS-generated data on concessions, grants, and civil war events. We find wartime violence intensity is associated with more concessions and fewer grants. We conversely find recentness of violence is associated with fewer concessions and more grants. Embedding our empirical analysis in a community resilience framework, we suggest the intensity of wartime violence may erode local institutions - be they traditional governance structures, or agricultural cooperatives seeking community lands - or limit their access to government bodies and local NGOs tasked with vetting, delimiting, and monitoring proposed concessions. Paradoxically, recentness violence may mobilize those same institutions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper also considers if becoming a co-operative academy presents an ironic opportunity to resist many of the current regressive educational trends epitomised by academisation.

    abstract = {Banking services (mobile money services and platforms) in most countries today is no doubt technology driven. In Nigeria, for instance, the introduction of electronic banking has brought some advancements and complications to the ways and manners in which banking services are performed. In fact, the resultant effect of techno-driven (technologydriven) banking services on savings and borrowing patterns of the rural poor cannot be undermined. This paper relied on data collected through questionnaire from a random sample of 250 respondents from rural Southwest Nigeria. A descriptive analysis of the data revealed average age of those surveyed to be 52 years with a mean household size of 6 members. Respondents' distribution by gender showed there were more males (53.6%) than females with 38.8% and 61.2% of the former and the latter having no formal education. Data analysis on available and accessible techno-driven banking services revealed use of mobile phones and occasional transactions from the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) as the most patronised. However, the result of probit model employed to ascertain drivers/enablers of technodriven banking services showed age, gender, household size, educational status, poverty level, power infrastructure and cooperative society membership as very important. While the coefficients of age, gender, educational status and cooperative society membership were significant and positive, those of household size, distance to banking facility, power infrastructure and poverty status were negative and significant. It is therefore, recommended that effort should be intensified at capacity building of respondents in order to catch up with the growing trend in technology advancement in the banking sector. Also, improvement in the dilapidated state of road and power and infrastructures in the study area is very crucial to effectively harness the benefit of mobile money services. © Isaac B.

    abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate risks faced by farmer cooperatives in China, using farmer cooperatives in Zhejiang province as a case. Specifically, the authors identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China (traditional and modern ones) when the external environment changes, the cooperative size expands and heterogeneity in membership widens. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assume that the "uncertainty of the external environment" and the "deviation of organisational adaptation" constitute the two dynamic factors that generated risks for farmer cooperatives. A survey of 158 farmer cooperatives is obtained in Zhejiang province in 2010, and factor analysis is employed to identify the risks and their critical degrees of traditional and modern cooperatives. Findings - The results indicate that two types of cooperatives in China face drastically different sets of risks. Traditional cooperatives face larger competitive and human resources risks, whereas modern cooperatives face larger decision-making and behavioural risks. Product market risk, macroeconomic policy risk and financial risk are common critical risks faced by both types of cooperatives. Originality/value - In this paper, risks in China's farmer cooperatives were empirically studied and systematically discussed. The paper offers a typology to identify risks inherent in two primary types of farmer cooperatives in China (traditional and modern ones) according to property rights arrangements and governance structure.

Although there has been some theoretical discussion about this issue, no empirical research has been done on these costs; the present study aims to bridge this gap. Following the literature, the main source of democratic costs in agricultural cooperatives is the level of member participation in cooperative governance. We have developed more specific theoretical insights about this special kind of decision-making cost by showing the effect of differences in the level of member participation on democratic costs, differences in terms of democratic and influence costs and in terms of agency costs, and differences between both direct and opportunity democratic costs. Members should take both the relative direct and opportunity costs within total democratic costs into account when determining the optimal size and composition of their board. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

    abstract = {The cooperative movement in Poland has a long but difficult history, which has caused farmers to have an aversion to cooperatives. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s, the first farmers’ cooperative marketing organizations, which were called agricultural producer groups, appeared in the market. T ese groups are bottom-up, voluntary organizations the primary purpose of which is to jointly sell their members’ output. In this paper, it is investigated why the new forms of governance, namely cooperative arrangements, were chosen, and we evaluate the implications of these choices on the market success of these groups. Empirical data were collected from 62 producer groups in one Polish province. We found that the groups were typically functioning as associations, unions, and limited liability companies. The factors that had an impact on the choices made were the number of members and the specific investment per member. Additionally, if the initial investment level was low, not only set-up and operational costs but also tax considerations played a role in the decision. T erefore, we argue that the new bottom-up cooperatives, which are theoretically suitable when the start-up capital is high or the number of members is large, will gradually be recognized and accepted in the market despite the fact that these cooperatives have a “bad reputation” caused by the socialist legacy. The new cooperative development trend confirms this argument. © 2015, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All Rights Reserved.},

    abstract = {Agriculture has both positive and negative impacts on the environment. With the growing awareness of environmental issues, improved approaches to agri-environmental management have become important policy issues. Previous studies on agri-environmental policies have focused on individual farmers rather than on collective action. However, some agri-environmental issues need to be managed by farmers co-operatively. Collective action can facilitate geographically appropriate management of resources, allow for shared knowledge among members thus increasing their capacities, and provide solutions for dealing with agri-environmental issues. However, sometimes, transaction costs can hinder collective action from being initiated. Moreover, farmers often need external support such as scientific knowledge, technical information and financial assistance. Thus, external help from public agencies or other interested bodies may be necessary to promote collective action. Many local and central governments encourage farmers and other stakeholders to take initiatives to manage the environment by themselves through various policy measures including technical assistance and financial assistance programmes. Collaboration with intermediaries is also necessary to facilitate state-community relationships. Governments can assist agri-environmental management, as opposed to interfering with it, through better agri-environmental policies that promote collective action. L'agriculture a des effets à la fois positifs et négatifs sur l'environnement. Les questions environnementales se faisant de plus en plus présentes, il devient important d'améliorer la façon dont les politiques approchent la gestion agroenvironnementale. Jusqu'à présent, les études sur les politiques agroenvironnementales se sont intéressées aux agriculteurs individuels plutôt qu'aux actions collectives. Certaines questions environnementales demandent cependant une coopération entre agriculteurs. L'action collective peut faciliter la gestion des ressources à un niveau géographique adéquat, permettre de partager des connaissances entre membres, et donc améliorer leur capacité, et offrir des solutions pour régler les questions environnementales. Cependant, les coûts de transaction peuvent parfois empêcher l'émergence d'actions collectives. En outre, les agriculteurs ont souvent besoin d'une aide extérieure comme des connaissances scientifiques, des informations techniques et de l'aide financière. Une aide des agences publiques ou d'autres institutions intéressées peut être nécessaire pour promouvoir l'action collective. De nombreux pouvoirs publics centraux et locaux encouragent les agriculteurs et d'autres parties prenantes à prendre des initiatives pour gérer l'environnement par eux-mêmes par le biais de diverses mesures gouvernementales comme l'assistance technique et les programmes d'aide financière. La collaboration avec des intermédiaires est également nécessaire pour faciliter les relations entre pouvoirs publics et communautés. Les pouvoirs publics peuvent aider la gestion environnementale plutôt qu'interférer avec elle, en mettant en place des mesures agroenvironnementales qui promeuvent l'action collective. Die Landwirtschaft hat sowohl positive als auch negative Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt. Mit zunehmender Wahrnehmung von Umweltbelangen hat die Verbesserung der Ansätze zum Agrarumweltmanagement einen hohen politischen Stellenwert erreicht. Bisherige Untersuchungen zu Agrarumweltpolitiken konzentrierten sich eher auf einzelne landwirtschaftliche Betriebe als auf ein kollektives Vorgehen. Einige Umweltbelange erfordern allerdings die Zusammenarbeit der Landwirte untereinander. Ein kollektives Vorgehen kann eine geografisch sinnvolle Handhabung von Ressourcen erleichtern, die Weitergabe von Wissen untereinander fördern und somit zu einer höheren Leistungsfähigkeit führen sowie zur Lösungsfindung bei Umweltfragen beitragen. In einigen Fällen kann es jedoch vorkommen, dass es auf Grund von Transaktionskosten nicht zu einem kollektiven Vorgehen kommt. Zudem benötigen die Landwirte oftmals Unterstützung von außen wie z.B. Kenntnisse aus Wissenschaft und technische Informationen oder Finanzhilfen. Daher könnte Hilfe von außen seitens staatlicher Stellen oder anderer Einrichtungen des öffentlichen Interesses erforderlich sein, um ein kollektives Vorgehen zu fördern. Viele Regional- und Zentralregierungen ermutigen die Landwirte und weitere Akteure, die Initiative zu ergreifen und sich der Umweltbelange selbst mit Hilfe von verschiedenen Politikmaßnahmen sowie technischer Unterstützung und Programmen zur Finanzierungshilfe anzunehmen. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Vermittlern ist ebenfalls erforderlich, um die Beziehungen zwischen Staat und Kommunen zu fördern. Die Regierungen können das Agrarumweltmanagement unterstützen, anstatt hier störend einzugreifen, indem sie bessere Agrarumweltpolitiken schaffen, die ein kollektives Vorgehen fördern. Agriculture has both positive and negative impacts on the environment. With the growing awareness of environmental issues, improved approaches to agri-environmental management have become important policy issues. Previous studies on agri-environmental policies have focused on individual farmers rather than on collective action. However, some agri-environmental issues need to be managed by farmers co-operatively. Collective action can facilitate geographically appropriate management of resources, allow for shared knowledge among members thus increasing their capacities, and provide solutions for dealing with agri-environmental issues.

    abstract = {Credit unions are membership-based cooperative financial services organizations that are run by and for their members. Historically, credit unions provided financial services for their members and encouraged community development through philanthropy and volunteering. The World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), the sector's global trade association and development agency, encourages the adoption of a management model, coined "new model," which encourages for-profit financial management practices. The "new model" approach is challenged by some practitioners and academics concerned that it will diminish the community involvement of credit unions. We explore the following research question: "Does the implementation of a management model that promotes for-profit-style financial management crowd out the community impact of credit unions?" We use a dataset extracted from 2,275 annual returns for 188 credit unions spanning 1996-2008, and find no evidence that community impact diminishes as a result of "new model" operating practices, suggesting a crowding-out effect is absent. © The Author(s) 2013.},

The statistical analysis uses nationally representative data for 8350 randomly-selected households interviewed during 2004/05 for the second Malawi Integrated Household Survey. Regressions are estimated separately for households in the north, centre, and south of Malawi to account for spatial heterogeneity. Results of a multilevel logit model reveal that households are less likely to be food insecure if they have larger cultivated land per capita, receive agricultural field assistance, reside in a community with an agricultural cooperative and relatively high annual rainfall, and are headed by an individual with a high school degree. Factors that positively correlate with household food insecurity are price of maize, price of fertiliser, number of household members, and distance to markets. Implications of these findings for policy are discussed. © 2013 Development Bank of Southern Africa.},

    abstract = {The Brazilian government has been encouraging fish farming in cages in federal water bodies, including hydroelectric reservoirs. Despite the government support, it is a new activity and the production model still needs some adjustment to reduce the production costs and achieve sustainability. The aims of this study were to determine the appropriate stocking density of Nile tilapia in cages in a hydroelectric reservoir and to evaluate to what extent fish size selection could improve their uniformity. Twelve cages (6m3) were placed at the Fish Farmers' Cooperative of Santa Fé do Sul and Region, Ilha Solteira reservoir, São Paulo, Brazil (20°12'10″S, 50°58'31.15″W). In stage I (initial fish weight, 78g), four stocking densities were tested: D1-800, D2-2000, D3-2500 and D4-3000 fish/cage, with three replicates. At the end of this stage (average fish weight, 255g), the fish were selected into three sizes, except for D1. In stage II, four stocking densities were tested, designed to obtain the following final production: D1-100kg/m3 (800 non-selected fish/cage), D2-80kg/m3 (600 fish/cage), D3-100kg/m3 (800 fish/cage) and D4-120kg/m3 (900 fish/cage). The trial ended when the fish weighed 800g. By reducing the initial stocking density from 2500 to 800 tilapia juveniles per cage, there was no need for selection. The growth performance was higher, the feed conversion rate was better and the time taken to reach harvesting was shorter. Consequently, the production cost reduced and the operating profit increased. Using the lowest initial stocking density, the risk of disease outbreak was also lower, and there was no need to use drugs for disease control since the mortality rate and occurrences of disease and deformity decreased and the dissolved oxygen level inside the cages was higher. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {This study examines issues existing in the southern collective forests in China, particularly prior to the implementation of new forest tenure reforms, such as continued illegal logging and timber theft, inadequate availability of finance and inconsistent forest-related policies. Such problems are believed to be hindering the adoption of sustainable forest management (SFM) and forest certification by forest farmers in China. Two strategies were introduced by the Chinese government with the purpose of addressing these issues, namely forest tenure reforms and their associated supporting mechanism, forestry property markets. Through two case studies in southern China, we investigated the effectiveness of the two strategies as well as their implications for the adoption of SFM and forest certification. The two cases were Yong'an in Fujian province and Tonggu in Jiangxi province. Personal interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with small-scale forest farmers who had already benefited from the two strategies as well as market officers working for the two selected forestry property markets. The study identified eight issues constraining the potential adoption of SFM and certification in China, including limited finance, poorly developed infrastructure and transport systems, insecure forest tenures, inconsistent forest policies, low levels of awareness, illegal forest management practices, lack of local cooperative organizations, and inadequate knowledge and technical transfer. We found that the new forest tenure reforms and forestry property markets had generally fulfilled their original objectives and had the capacity to assist in addressing many of the issues facing forests prior to the reforms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {The Indian economy struggles with electricity supply deficits and low quality supply. Although several initiatives including demand side management measures have already been implemented, consumers from different backgrounds suffer from various drawbacks of quality supply. This paper explores the valuation of electricity quality from the perspective of domestic consumers in Hyderabad, India. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with 798 urban households. For analysis, we apply a scale-adjusted latent class model to identify heterogeneity in preferences and in variance-scale. The results confirm the hypothesis of highly heterogeneous household preferences and reveal limited preparedness of domestic users to pay for improved electricity quality and renewable energy. Further, most respondents prefer state owned distribution companies to private enterprises or cooperative societies. We argue that the estimated preferences, implying demand and willingness to pay for single attributes of electricity quality, can help policy makers to adequately incorporate consumers' interests into decision making. The results further indicate that domestic tariff hikes should not be used to finance extension of renewable energies or infrastructure investment to improve reliability in supply. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The case of China is perhaps particularly significant, as the co-operatives there are operating still within the context of state control, and it is not clear how they might develop in the future. Were China to decide that the co-operative and mutual corporate form had an important role to play alongside state, personal and shareholder-ownership models, then given the significant role of China in the global economy, this could have a major impact on the type of corporate diversity the world's economy enjoys in future years. These ‘alternative’ corporate forms include consumer co-operatives and producer co-operatives, as well as financial mutuals and employee ownership. There have been calls for this broadly defined mutual sector to become the most dynamic part of the global economy by the end of this decade. In the context of the Asia Pacific, this looks an attractive proposition in terms of promoting corporate diversity and delivering sustainable development and regional resilience. © 2014, © 2014 Chris Rowley and Jonathan Michie.},

The social performance assessment follows an internationally renowned methodology of social auditing. It provides the database for the construction of a social output, which, apart from outreach, evaluates social network quality, client benefits (protection from over-indebtedness) and other items that have not been assessed in efficiency analysis before. We develop a new analytical model for Data Envelopment Analysis and gain meaningful results for the sample of ACCs.

    abstract = {AbstractExpected daily FL ranges (length at date) of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha have been used throughout California's Central Valley to identify federally listed winter-run and spring-run juveniles in a mixed four-race stock. Accurate race identification is critical both to species recovery and to management of the water supply for 25 million people and a multibillion-dollar agricultural industry. We used genetic race assignment of 11,609 juveniles sampled over 6 years to characterize the accuracy of the length-at-date approach, specifically by testing two of its central assumptions: (1) juvenile FL distributions do not overlap between races on a daily basis; and (2) the growth rates that are used to project FL at date are accurate. We found that 49% of FLs for genetically identified juveniles occurred outside the expected length-at-date ranges for their respective races, and we observed a high degree of overlap in FL ranges among the four races. In addition, empirical growth rates were well below those from which length-at-date criteria were derived. Given the high degree of FL overlap between races, we conclude that modification of the length-at-date method will not substantially reduce identification error. Thus, we recommend that genetic assignment be used at least as a supplemental approach to improve Central Valley Chinook Salmon race identification, research, and management. © 2014, © American Fisheries Society 2014.},

    abstract = {Haitian cocoa consists mainly of the Criollo and Trinitario varieties, which are in strong demand around the world and are used in high-quality chocolate production. But the potential of Haiti's cocoa has never been optimized: it has long been sold on the international market in the form of ordinary unfermented cocoa. Only recently have producers become aware of the benefits of producing fermented cocoa. In 2009, thanks to technical assistance from the Peruvian cooperative CEPICAFE for the Haitian cooperative network FECCANO, and thanks to support from the French NGO Agronomes et Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (AVSF), their fermented cocoa output was immediately taken up and marketed by European firms, including the French fair-trade company Ethiquable. Since then, the global quality cocoa market has opened up to Haitian cocoa. At the local level, the economic, social and environmental impacts of this innovation are significant. There are two main lessons to be drawn from this experience: (i) exchanges between developing countries should be stepped up in agricultural assistance programs, as the "success stories" identified in the different countries involved have a higher potential for replication; (ii) collaborative business relationships, initiated some years ago now by certain buyers from developed countries, can provide more sustainable support for the development of family agriculture in developing countries. International cooperation, with innovative approaches such as the one adopted in this case by AVSF can, therefore, make an effective contribution to the agricultural development of developing countries. To consolidate the impetus given to Haiti's cocoa industry by cocoa fermentation, it is essential to focus interventions on increasing the output of quality cocoa, on better targeting of niche markets, on reinforcing small-producer cooperatives, and on improving local governance in the cocoa sector. © Auteur(s) 2013.},

Since cooperatives in the socialist system provided numerous social services and contributed to rural development, another research question concerns the survival of this tradition. Through twin case studies in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and East Germany we present the conditions and strategies for achieving sustainability of co-operatives. The results reveal important requirements for cooperatives to be sustainable: overcoming the communist legacy of mistrust against cooperative organizations, convincing members by building trust, coping with fundamental collective action problems, constructive communication that takes the problems and ideas of members seriously, finding cooperative leaders able to cope with members' opportunism and a facilitating state encouraging the development of cooperatives. © 2014 CIRIEC.},

    abstract = {The immediate consequences of the 2009 reform of the cotton sector in Benin are assessed from the farmers' perspective. Using a policy arrangements approach, we analyse how farmers experienced the transformations brought about by the reform and how it influenced their day-to-day activities. The new farmer cooperatives established after the reform were trusted by farmers. Many farmers returned to the sector, increasing cotton output. Nevertheless, productivity remained low, around 900 kg/ha, probably because the reform addressed mainly institutional constraints. Technical constraints relating to varietal choice, soil fertility improvement, and pest management were neglected. The policy arrangements emerging from the reform still generate discussion, in particular about the way actors and coalitions are organized. The top-down approach of the reform process has limitations for problem-solving, especially where actors' interests collide. The adjustments made under the reform with regard to farmer-based organizations and actors from public services, the caution solidaire, and farmers' supervision proved inappropriate for solving the institutional problems posed at the nodes of actors and coalitions, resources, discourses, and institutions, thereby further undermining the cotton sector. A mix of technological and institutional reforms might offer a more effective option for the future. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

    abstract = {This paper reports on an in-depth assessment of smallholder livestock production in rainfed agro-pastoral communities of Mali through an analysis of data from 36 case studies. Approximately 1,108 farmers were involved, with twothirds of the case studies focusing on ruminant production and the remainder dealing with cooperative capacity building. Feeding and forage-related needs were the most frequently assessed in the case studies involving smallholders raising small ruminants or cattle, whereas organization-related needs were the most frequently assessed in those involving smallholder livestock cooperatives. Meeting the feed and forage requirements of small ruminants and cattle is the most urgent need for livestock smallholders, but addressing this challenge will be difficult without concurrent control of the breeding season and common diseases as well as implementation of appropriate methods to track and cull unproductive animals. Empowerment of grass-roots organizations, particularly women's cooperatives, through literacy programmes and effective extension outreach could have significant impacts on the improvement of smallholder livestock enterprises.},

Thus, this paper uses Brazils experience with biodiesel as a basis for proposing a framework for a Biodiesel Program in Guinea-Bissau. The proposed framework includes the following elements related to public policy, regulations, organizations and mechanisms: (i) introduction of biodiesel through the creation and implementation of laws and regulations; (ii) an Inter-ministerial Executive Committee to plan, coordinate and manage the program; (iii) promotion, incentives and support for agricultural and agro-industrial production by providing tax benefits for specific links of the chain, creating incentive programs for different oilseeds and establishing programs that support family farming; and (iv) the creation and installation of representative bodies for the stakeholders involved in the chain, such as small farmers cooperatives, national association of biodiesel producers, R&D and rural extension programs. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

In witnessing these structural changes, scholars have proffered analyses of nontraditional ownership models focusing on residual claim rights. However, crucial information on the allocation of control rights in cooperatives is missing. This study sheds light on alternative ownership-control models adopted by agricultural cooperatives in different regions across the world. In each of these models, we describe the allocation of formal control rights with a focus on decision management and decision control rights. We thus provide empirical evidence on the "separation of ownership and control" in agricultural cooperatives. We also analyze each of the governance models in terms of the associated ownership costs, including risk-bearing costs, the costs of controlling managers, and collective decision-making costs. In doing so, we are able to better understand the forces influencing the organizational efficiency of each cooperative model. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

    abstract = {A study was conducted on economics of milk marketing at Jaipur Dairy Cooperative, Jaipur (Rajasthan) during the financial year 2009-10. In this, an effort was made for economic analysis of marketing costs incurred by Jaipur dairy in milk marketing. The study was based on secondary data of Jaipur Dairy Cooperatives which were collected from the monthly progress reports, audit reports and other related records of Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation, Jaipur Dairy Plant, Jaipur as well as from the milk collection and chilling centers. In order to study the marketing cost which includes the cost of collection and processing of milk, the data were collected from Jaipur Dairy Plant on different aspects viz., chilling charges, transportation cost and commission to milk collection cooperative societies, water and electricity charges, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and interest on capital expenditure. The data were arranged in simple tabular form and simple averages and percentages by total costs were computed, unit costs were also calculated by dividing each cost incurred by the quantity of milk handled. It has been found that the average total cost of milk collection spent by Jaipur Dairy was Rs. 18.79 and the average total cost of milk processing was Rs. 2.33/1 during the year 2009-10. These unit costs of milk collection and milk processing are important for policy and decision makers when they make policies and developmental programmes related to dairy sector for boosting the economy.},

Thus, the first purpose of this study was to specify criteria for performance benchmarking, and identify best practices in palm oil contract farming. Second, we also aimed at developing and implementing a benchmarking model with criteria for trading the products from palm oil contract farming. The approach to these goals was to collect data about palm oil marketing practices in the study area, and about contract farming economic status and practices. To test for validity or results, assigned trading practices were used for 3 months, and the results assessed qualitatively. There were three types of participants, namely (1) 73 farmers who joined the program, (2) the Wattana Agricultural Cooperative Oil Palm ramp, and (3) the Jiras Palm crushing plant. The best practices from the study overall fit the policy to "improve quality - reduce costs -increase price ". The best practice for farmers was to improve fresh fruit bunch quality by adjusting the harvesting cycle, and to sell as a group or create a farmer network based on quality policy. The best practices at ramps included comprehensive and vivid grading criteria, trustworthy quality selection, price incentive based on oil palm fruit bunch quality, management policy, public relations, technical assistance to suppliers, guaranteed accurate weighing scales, and establishment of a harvest team. The best practices of crushing plants were to create incentives for customers, quality-based purchasing policy, and attention to transportation advantages.},

    abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to study the propensity of consumer cooperatives (Coops) to use incentive schemes in situations of strategic interaction with profit-maximizing firms (PMFs). Our model provides a reason why Coops are less prone than PMFs to pay variable bonuses to their managers. We show that this occurs under price competition when in equilibrium the Coop prefers to pay a flat wage to its manager relying instead on her intrinsic motivation, whereas the profit-maximizing rival adopts a variable, high-powered incentive scheme. The main rationale is that, by recruiting a manager whose preferences are aligned with the company goals (e.g., a consumer-owner), the Coop is per se highly expansionary in term of output. Therefore, the Coop does not need to rely on an externally hired manager who sets prices aggressively to expand market share and quantity. Furthermore, adopting a monetary reward based on sales and profits leads to distorted incentives with respect to the Coop’s goal, which after all is the welfare of its members. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

    abstract = {This article shows how paramilitaries and allied companies put grassroots development discourses of political participation and subsidiarity, environmental conservation, and ethnic empowerment to work in executing and ratifying their massive land grab in northwest Colombia. More than a case of trying to "whitewash" their malfeasance with fashionable and politically correct development-speak, I argue that the grassroots development apparatus-its discourses, institutional forms, and practices-became utterly instrumental to the illegal land seizures. Moreover, when operating alongside practices of land parcelization, iterative transactions, producers' cooperatives, and third-party intermediaries, grassroots development facilitated what could be called "land laundering." In the process, grassroots development became a conduit for paramilitary-backed state formation in which projects of liberal governance commonly associated with the imperatives of institution building, good governance, and the rule of law became perversely compatible with the region's economies of violence. With the World Bank increasingly concerned over the conflation of fragile states, violent conflict, and alarming land grabs, this article raises questions about how the grassroots solutions currently being endorsed by the Bank can in some cases actually facilitate dispossession, illicit economies, and violent political projects. The way paramilitaries harnessed grassroots development also has critical implications for debates about post-development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper considers how the provision of financial audit services for agricultural cooperatives can be strengthened. We assess the current status of agricultural cooperatives in the country and the demand and supply of financial audit services for them. We then review the approaches taken in 11 other countries for providing financial audit services to agricultural cooperatives in order to identify approaches Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives might consider. Insights are gained on the need for capacity building within cooperatives on financial oversight, building internal incentives for cooperatives to have conducted regular financial audits on their accounts, addressing the deficit of auditors within Ethiopia, and creating reporting mechanisms so that any emerging financial problems within a cooperative are made known and addressed in a timely manner. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Three out of four poor people live in rural areas, and the majority of rural inhabitants depend on agriculture. Access to appropriate financial services is a critical factor for agricultural development and yet, due to the specific constraints that come with financing agriculture (reaching isolated rural areas, working with highly seasonal activities, agro-climatic risks, etc.), developing an adequate supply of financial services remains a challenge in most of agricultural countries. Agriculture is one of the most determinative sectors of the Albanian economy and the main working alternative of people living in the rural areas. Microfinance programs target both economic and social poverty. To assess the effectiveness of these programs, MFIs need to measure the impact on the borrowers, who in our case are the farmers. The goal of this research paper pertained to economic impacts analysis, and what their implication on the farmers' income and activity is. In general, the study has identified various positive impacts on the farmers' activities that proclaim that ASC Union services are useful and viable. To assess these impacts, 100 questionnaires were conducted in Central and North Albania, while SPSS Software program with the main purpose to show the level of involvement of the farmers in the micro credit program and a model based on two-way causalities, together with econometric tools such as regression, cross-tabulation and correlation analysis, to address the issues of impacts were used. Overall, our study found out that 27% of the farmers choose to borrow from ASC Union because taking out a loan from this credit union is easier than borrowing from another MFI, while 15% said that ASC Union has the lowest interest rate in the credit market for the micro loans. Furthermore, 87 farmers out of 100, who were 4 to 10 year-old-members of the credit union, had their income increased in the last 3 years, whereas only 13 farmers answered that there was no change in their income in those years. Moreover, the farmers who took out 2, 3, 4 or 5 micro loans admitted that the micro loan was useful and helped them to increase and improve their activities, while on the other hand the ones who took just one loan proclaimed that there is no change in their income or activities.},

Or aujourd'hui, les chercheurs et directeurs de coopératives constatent une baisse de ces deux niveaux de participation. Ce papier a pour objectif de construire une typologie des adhérents de coopératives agricoles du secteur céréalier français au regard de leurs comportements de participation puis d'identifier les déterminants qui expliquent l'appartenance des adhérents à une des classes de la typologie à partir d'un modèle probit multinomial. Nous faisons l'hypothèse que les attitudes de confiance et d'implication organisationnelles manifestées par l'adhérent envers sa coopérative peuvent expliquer ces différences de comportements aux côtés de variables individuelles liées à l'adhérent et son exploitation agricole et de variables liées à la coopérative à laquelle il adhère. L'analyse des comportements de participation permet de regrouper les 290 adhérents de l'échantillon en trois classes distinctes: «les individualistes», «les bons soldats» et «les engagés». Les résultats du probit multinomial sur ces 3 classes montrent notamment un effet significatif de l'attitude d'implication organisationnelle, de la présence de stockage à la ferme et de la taille de la coopérative sur la probabilité d'être individualiste par rapport aux deux autres classes. When a farmer joins an agricultural cooperative, he or she undertakes to participate in the cooperative economically, as a co-operator, and also in its administration, as an associate. Yet, today, researchers and directors of cooperatives are observing a drop in member participation in both spheres. The goal of this paper is to build a typology of the members of grain farmer agricultural co-operatives in France, based on the members' participation, and then use a multinomial probit model to identify the factors that come into play and result in a member belonging to a given category in the typology. We make the hypothesis that attitudes with respect to organizational involvement and the member's confidence in his or her co-operative can explain these differences in behavior, along with individual variables tied to the member and his or her farm business, and variables associated with the co-operative to which the member belongs. Following the analysis of the participation behavior of the 290 members in the sample, the members can be grouped into three distinct categories: "individualists," "good soldiers," and "engaged.". © 2013 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

    abstract = {The third publication phase of the new Rural Sociology series (1998-2005) is presented in five parts. In the first part the author examines the socio-economic context: changes and problems in the agrarian and social structure caused by privatization based on the doctrine of neoliberal capitalism, refeudalization of village and agriculture, war consequences, intense social stratification and 40% fall in agricultural production, compared to 1988 and 1989. In the second part the author presents the crisis and implosion of the oldest Croatian infrastructure unit for rural sociological research and two research projects about the Croatian village in transition, settlement network and network society done in the Institute for Social Research in Zagreb. The third part is about the journal's logistics. Systematic rural sociological research lost all financial support in the last decade of 20th century which caused the final exodus of researchers. Along with the desintegration of the rural sociology school in Zagreb, it meant the loss of institutional support for the scientific rural sociology periodical. The highest price of the wrong policy was paid: human capital was squandered and the research field lost. The Institute's other research teams could not back up the very specialized journal of rural sociology. The fourth part of the presentation deals with the new concept of overcoming the crisis, editorial policy, changes in the Board and Council and the new profile of the journal which eventually changed its name in 2006. The original concept from 1963 was broadened and it comprised the cooperation of the Institute's research potential with contributions from sociology and other similar disciplines whose primary interest was social, economic and cultural development, based on rural, urban and spatial research, agroecology, protection of ruralism and bioethics. The journal's profile was defined as problem-solving and Rural Sociology remained the primary scholarly journal with the same structure and publication frequency. The fifth part is dedicated to the journal's achievements, primarily its most valuable works which defined the profile of the new series. The journal basically overcame the crisis and made up for the lost time, money and human potential by opening up to contributions from other scientific disciplines (first about the ruralurban continuum, settlement network and social processes in space, then about religious and other research in the Institute), and to foreign authors. Because of their excellence the author singles out 12 contributions by home authors and 9 thematic issues among which stands out the jubilee issue for the 40th anniversary of the continued publication of the first Croatian sociology journal. It was entitled "People who created Rural Sociology". Other special issues with their recent and well-founded theories and methodology include village in transition, network of settlements and network society, islanders and island communities and agricultural cooperatives. Due to a large number of scientific works (six out of ten), based on experimental research of the Croatian society and village, Rural Sociology is a valuable and visible publication in the world scholarly community; there is reference to works published in it in eight world data banks. © 2013 Institute for Social Research in Zagreb - All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {The recent policies of governmental purchases that emerged in the years 2000, such as the National Program of Food in Schools (PNAE) and the Food Acquisition Program (PAA), have brought significant opportunities for family agriculture cooperatives in Brazil to access markets. In spite of the possibilities that the PNAE and the PAA offer to family agriculture and its organizations, these programs also present a series of challenges, which involve different agents in the food acquisition process. This article intends to delineate the profile of family agriculture cooperatives in Minas Gerais and analyze their main difficulties to access the institutional market. We analyzed 19 diagnostics carried out in 2011 in family agriculture cooperatives from different regions of Minas Gerais State. In spite of the access to the local markets in both regional and municipal scopes, it was identified that there are issues related to technical assistance, sanitary adaptation, management and logistics that hinder the access of these cooperatives to such policies in the big centers of Minas Gerais.},

    abstract = {As part of the UNESCO Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) 2005-2014, a study was undertaken with the main aim of determining the type of projects, subject areas and participants involved in environmental education (EE) in Portugal. The study was based on two national surveys - one directed at a wide range of non-school state, private and cooperative organisations; the other at primary and secondary schools. The specific objective was to determine the extent to which the promoters and facilitators of EE/ESD have adopted the new trends and concepts emerged in this area, taking into account the fact that on-going initiatives may follow two differing approaches: i) a more naturalist and traditional approach based on natural scientific knowledge, and ii) a newly-developing and more innovative approach that places greater emphasis on the close ties and dynamic relationships between environmental quality, socio-political and socio-economic factors. Notwithstanding controversies arising for differing reasons (inertia/conservatism or complaint/contestation), the aim of this new approach is to achieve a more significant role for sustainable development in the broad social field of citizenship education and mobilising support for sustainable development. By reporting some of the most representative results, our aim is to contribute to a description of EE/ESD based on empirical observation. One finding, for example, refers to the persistent narrowing of the field of action that results from the predominance of ecological over civic issues. The general picture, despite some exceptions, is of initiatives dominated by traditional formats and themes (e.g. urban solid waste, nature conservation) and an underestimation of other areas of equal importance for sustainable development, such as greater coordination between schools and local communities in dealing with problems related to socio-economic, health, urban planning, quality of life, etc. Trend that is also evident in the excessive weight given to younger students, to the detriment of a wider approach that would broaden the scope of EE by including the entire age range of school communities, and a model that involves more effective ties with local communities, as described above.},

    abstract = {Currently, the alternative forms of management are increasingly applied in agriculture. Although their less negative impact on environment is generally supposed, there is still a lack of a reliable data about their real favourability for the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates, including millipedes. Therefore, the aim of our study was to find out, whether the form of agricultural management affects the structure of millipede communities and hence, the performance of their functions in soil ecosystems. The research was carried out using pitfall trapping through growing seasons 2005 to 2007 on the model territory of Agricultural Cooperative (AC) Očová (Central Slovakia). Millipedes were captured at four pairs of sites (8 sites in total). The same cultivated crop (wheat, barley, alfalfa or permanent law) with application of two different forms of agricultural management (conventional form and sustainable form with basic sustainable agro-environmental scheme) was characteristic of each pair of sites. The research results disclosed that the management form plays a significant role, especially in such agrocoenoses, in which the same crop is cultivated for several years (e.g. sites with alfalfa or permanent lawn), i.e., on the sites without ploughing or other similar agrotechnical measures. In these cases, the sites with the sustainable agro-environmental scheme had higher species richness (8 and 9 species) and higher total abundance of millipede communities (2.2 and 5.7 ind. collected per one day and one trap) than the sites with the conventional form of agrotechnical management (5 and 5 species, 0.09 and 0.3 ind. collected per one day and one trap). In order to obtain a more detailed knowledge about the impact of agricultural management forms on millipede communities, this kind of research should be carried out in different conditions (other crops, soil conditions, climate zones, etc.) as well. © 2014, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The paper specifically identify and describes the socio-economic characteristics of members of the cooperative societies; find out the ways that members benefit from the cooperative group; examine the contributions of the cooperatives to rural economic activities in the study area; identify the constraints limiting the optimum performance of the cooperatives in the study area and make recommendations for greater effectiveness of craft and artisan cooperative societies in the study area. Survey design was adopted to conduct this study. Data was collected with the help of a self-administered researcher-constructed Questionnaire administered on 400 members of craft and artisan cooperative societies that were purposively selected. A pilot test of the instruments gave reliability estimates of 0.79. Data was analyzed descriptively using frequency, simple percentage and rank-order respectively. Results obtained (partial listing) indicated that education (of members) is a significant indicator that can effectively mobilize cooperative societies to attract government presence for assistance, lack of educated members could hinder the leadership structure of the group. Meeting frequently (usually weekly) could help to sustain cooperative societies and also serve as a catalyze for sharing of knowledge and new ideas which could be effective in improving business, solving personal and group challenges as well as increase work productivity. The Osusu scheme could help to abate poverty and solve the problem of insufficient and lack of fund which a significant population of craft men and artisans face often times. Finally, result shows that insufficient fund, migration, non governmental support, corruption among leaders etc. are some of the limiting factors to the optimum performance of craft and artisan cooperative societies in the study area. It was therefore concluded that organize effort to mobilize craft and artisans for cooperative spirit in the study area, and anywhere else, could assist to increase access to fund, dissemination of information and innovations, and reduce poverty.},

The empirical basis was a survey of farmers in Finland. Findings from limited dependent variable regression models suggest that the farmers who are most loyal to their cooperatives tend to oppose its foreign investments. Another group of farmers tended to switch membership status between different cooperatives, and a third group tended to opt out of cooperatives. The two latter categories were characterised by a lower level of social capital, and both of them welcomed the cooperatives’ international operations. This finding was more significant for individual farm types than the social capital-linked opposition to internationalisation. A general conclusion is that the internationalisation of cooperatives seems to affect the members’ trust in the cooperative differently. Thus there is increasing heterogeneity within the memberships which may give rise to governance problems. © 2014, MTT Agrifood Research Finland. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {In two studies, we develop and test theory about the relationship between speaking up, one type of organizational citizenship behavior, and unit performance by accounting for where employee voice is flowing. Results from a qualitative study of managers and professionals across a variety of industries suggest that voice to targets at different formal power levels (peers or superiors) and locations in the organization (inside or outside a focal unit) differs systematically in terms of its usefulness in generating actions to a unit's benefit on the issues raised and in the likely information value of the ideas expressed. We then theorize how distinct voice flows should be differentially related to unit performance based on these core characteristics and test our hypotheses using time-lagged field data from 801 employees and their managers in 93 units across nine North American credit unions. Results demonstrate that voice flows are positively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at the focal leader of that unit-who should be able to take action-whether from that leader's own subordinates or those in other units, and negatively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at coworkers who have little power to effect change. Together, these studies provide a structural framework for studying the nature and impact of multiple voice flows, some along formal reporting lines and others that reflect the informal communication structure within organizations. This research demonstrates that understanding the potential performance benefits and costs of voice for leaders and their units requires attention to the structure and complexity of multiple voice flows rather than to an undifferentiated amount of voice. © The Author(s) 2013.},

The credit union is run by the Catholic diocese that envisioned prosperity to its members coming from different religious denominations and from low income families thus the need to recommend improvements to ensure its sustainability and service to the community. The study analyzed financial performance from 2007 to 2012 and determined members’ satisfaction of services rendered. It used semi-structured survey instruments, personal interview, and focus group discussion to gather data. Findings of the study revealed that members’ savings were not sufficiently protected. However, members were very satisfied with almost all of the services offered by the credit union. The study concludes that there is a need to improve its portfolio quality and liquidity management as evidenced by a high rate of loan delinquency. To ensure more sustainable operations, it is recommended that management exert effort to increase net loans receivables but at the same time address members’ high delinquency rate for loans. Additional investment on liquid assets is suggested for loan portfolio to generate more revenue and increase the net institutional capital. It is further recommended that future studies would include governance and organizational performance particularly on credit management processes to complement the results of this study. © 2014, University of San Jose-Recoletos.

    abstract = {Purpose: Despite the fact that customer satisfaction is among the most widely used metrics by managers, the link with share of deposits tends to be weak. Using a recent innovative approach termed the "Wallet Allocation Rule (WAR)" this research investigates whether measuring satisfaction relative to other competitors used exhibits a stronger correlation to share of deposits compared to measuring absolute satisfaction with the focal firm/product. Design/methodology/approach: A survey approach was used with a sample of 4,712 banking customers across the USA. Using the WAR, each respondent's satisfaction ratings were transformed into relative rankings and used to estimate their share of deposits. Findings: The results confirmed that at both the individual and the aggregate level examining relative ranked satisfaction correlates strongly with customers' share of deposits. At the individual level relative satisfaction explains 55 percent of the variance in share of deposits, as opposed to only 9 percent for absolute satisfaction. Practical implications: The findings indicate that managers need to rethink their current approach to satisfaction measurement and consider measuring their customers' satisfaction relative to competitors used. Furthermore, using aggregate level absolute satisfaction in managerial decision making can be misleading. Originality/value: This research provides a significant contribution to both the banking literature and the scientific literature in general by examining the robustness of a relative metrics approach within the retail banking and credit union market. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The catchment area served by that stud covered nearly half of the province. Four years later, in response to the progressing post-war reconstruction, intensive growth of state-owned farms and farmers' cooperatives, another stallion stud was created in Braniewo. The formation of both studs was greatly aided by the State Stallion Stud in Kwidzyn. Horses from the two studs in the Province of Olsztyn were used for work in farming, for transport as well as for recreation and sports horse riding. Some of the horses could also be seen in historical films. However, the technological progress in farming gradually depreciated the role of horses, which led to a decline in horse breeding.

Our objective in the above discussion is to advance a conceptual framework using new institutional economics theories that draws attention to the importance of the organizational structure of contractors for the design of the proliferation of contracts increasingly governing agricultural production. Understanding the interplay between organizational form and contract structure is a necessary step in understanding why and how contracting is occurring, where and when it does. This article also shows that Transaction Cost Economics theory is an efficient tool to explain the organizational capital structure and the micro-analytical details not yet appreciated by the usual analyses.},

To do that, they need to re-construct open and participative dialogue with their employees and members based on more democratic forms of communication and engagement. From this point of view, the measurement and communication of sustainability aspects may allow a dialogue to be mobilized with shareholders and stakeholders without losing the attention on competitive factors. Based on these premises, the article analyses the experience of a 5-year action research project (from 2006 to mid-2011), carried out within Unicoop Tirreno, an Italian consumers' cooperative, and aimed to implement different tools for sustainability accounting and to embrace a more open dialogue with stakeholders, in particular with employees and members. In this process of change, the tools implemented for sustainability accounting played a key role in supporting the cooperative to reinterpret its own values and in stimulating a new and participative management approach. The results indicate a virtuous circle between the management and measurement of cooperative principles and the management and measurement of sustainability issues. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This raises the question - if purely capitalist corporations are founded upon an understanding of property most in line with the theories of established property scholars Bentham and Locke, is there room for a different kind of concept of property in the realm of U.S. business? In this paper I explore the way in which the workers' cooperative model infuses a sense of moral responsibility into a group of individuals' understanding of "property" in order to create a collectively managed enterprise that measures success both in economic and socio-political terms. I first review a large body of literature on the various forms of cooperative ownership and management, focusing on the history of the co-operative model, the rights entailed under the model, and the advantages as well as criticisms associated with co-operatives. I then use this literature to situate a case study example of a co-operative organization - The Cheese Board Collective, a worker-owned artisan cheese and pizza shop in Berkeley, California - and to analyze my findings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {The agricultural sector and the rural sector in China have experienced fundamental changes from the 1980s onward, and farmer cooperatives have emerged in response to these changes. Beginning in 1990, a series of different policies have been implemented by the Chinese government to promote farmer cooperatives (FCs). This article aims to explore the functioning of FCs on the basis of the type and scope of the services they provide and their connections with the rural communities. The findings show that activities carried out by FCs help to extend farmers' engagement in value-chain participation and management. FCs, as organizational innovations, also provide opportunities to bring knowledge providers and farmers together. Some FCs are starting to coordinate activities for farmers, rural communities and local government to make better use of collective resources. Four types of FCs are identified in the research: commoditybased FCs, community-based FCs, specialized technology providers and credit service providers. The emergence of these four types of FCs is embedded in broader institutional developments. The government mainly promotes commodity-based FCs and specialized technology-providing FCs. Companies focus on commodity-based FCs, and research institutes and development organizations are involved in community-based FCs. These findings imply that an integrated and broader view of policies is needed to promote the development of FCs in the long run. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2014.},

The peasants were first given some land, only to have it taken it away over the course of several years, during the process of collectivisation. The poor farmers, especially those who lacked good civil morals, perceived the process chance to control the future development of the countryside. It seems most of them did not see or were not able to see the purpose of the changes in the social structure of the village, or especially the real intentions of the communists. Any manipulative ideological influence on the countryside is very harmful in its effect, and the consequences are difficult to remove even after a long period of time. This article deals with the current economic and agricultural transformations in Central Asia and demonstrates a risk for the insensitive procedures used in agricultural transformation to be repeated.},

These differences in risk decline with greater asset size. Evidence is also presented that credit unions that switched from single-bond institutions to broader field-of-membership types now operate with greater risk. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

However, they can be accelerated by human activities and therefore increase negative impacts on agricultural production as well as disturbing watershed management. Romania currently faces major environmental challenges and pressure on soil and water resources due to unsustainable farming practices and inappropriate tillage practices. The present work represents the first attempt to test the combined use of radionuclide approaches (i.e. 137Cs and 210Pbex) to quantify soil erosion changes in cultivated Transylvanian fields (Romania) at different temporal scales. Fourteen soil cores were collected along two transects in a cultivated field and two reference sites were selected to establish the mean reference inventories for both 137Cs and 210Pbex. A value of 5460±880Bqm-2 (n=10; CV=16%) was determined for the 137Cs mean reference inventory for both sites, given as areal activity±standard deviation, at 2σ confidence interval. As regarding 210Pbex reference inventory, its value (9640Bqm-2) is only given by the areal activity of one soil core from the second site. The high erosion rates obtained with the 210Pbex approach are an effect of the up and down ploughing practices which took place at the time of the local agricultural cooperative starting in the late 1950s. The middle-term redistribution rates provided by the 137Cs technique highlighted preponderant deposition processes in the field investigated, reflecting the changes in the cultivation system with ploughing across the slope at the beginning of 1990s. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {What explains the electoral staying power of many Japanese interest groups in the wake of electoral reform? Electoral explanations provide part of the answer; candidates in elections to both houses of the Diet continue to face incentives-many of them unintended-to court the organized vote. But missing from such accounts is an explanation of why economically noncompetitive groups provide the bulk of such support. The primary reason for this, I argue, is organization. As a result of their historical linkages to the bureaucracy, many interests developed hierarchical, national organizational structures that enabled them to carry out a variety of vote-gathering functions that the parties had trouble performing themselves. Although electoral reform and long-term demographic trends have weakened the electoral influence of interest groups, these organizational complementarities between groups and the parties continue to matter in Japanese elections-including under conditions of two-party competition. To illustrate these points, I trace the evolution of interest group politics from the era of LDP dominance through the rise of two-party competition and the LDP's recent return to power, using postmasters associations and agricultural cooperatives as case studies.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the lender-borrower relationship as it relates to Sannong loans for agricultural and rural financial markets by Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCCs) and other rural lenders. This paper is motivated by recent reforms to the rural credit market designed to encourage increased lending, particularly to farmers. Little is understood about the lender-borrower relationship in rural China. This paper fills that gap. Design/methodology/approach: The paper investigates relational attitudes between 120 loan officers at RCCs in China's costal Shandong province, paired with a field survey using matched questions to 394 farm households in the same region. Pairing lenders' perception toward borrowers regarding RCC microcredit lending mechanism, against borrowers' perception toward lenders and how themselves were perceived by lenders in the same regards, the paper investigates the degree of disconnect between lenders and with distinct cluster groupings based on their perceptions, the paper analyzes the influence of demographics on the borrower and lender cluster memberships. Findings: The paper identifies four borrower clusters and two lender clusters. Borrower clusters are segmented on credit access and satisfaction with their rural lender. The paper also identifies two lender clusters, segmented principally on financial incentives and lending activities. While all lenders view farming with higher regard than farmers believe they do, one cluster is clearly pro-farmer while the second is somewhat indifferent. Indifference is more related to current portfolio activities. The paper draws conclusions that policy initiatives should be put in place at RCCs that close the gap between lender and borrower in their credit relationship. Rural lenders should concentrate on advocating RCCs' care and trust toward agriculture and farm households. At the institutional level, effort should be extended to train a dedicated team of loan officers that specialize in servicing farm households with standardized lending practices. This research provides financial institutions with outreach mechanisms to borrowers, while also training lenders to borrowers' sensitivities. Originality/value: Management studies of RCCs are few. This is the first paper that the authors are aware of that studies farmer and lender attitudes on the same scale. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {The nineteenth century saw the standardization and rapid spread of the modern business corporation around the world. Yet those early corporations differed from their contemporary counterparts in important ways. Most obviously, they commonly deviated from the one-share-onevote rule that is customary today, instead adopting restricted voting schemes that favored small over large shareholders. In recent years, both legal scholars and economists have sought to explain these schemes as a rough form of investor protection, shielding small shareholders from exploitation by controlling shareholders in an era when investor protection law was weak. We argue, in contrast, that restricted voting rules generally served not to protect shareholders as investors, but to protect them as consumers. The firms adopting such rules were frequently local monopolies that provided vital infrastructural services such as transportation, banking, and insurance. The local merchants, farmers, and landholders who used these services were the firms' principal shareholders. They commonly purchased shares not in the expectation of profit, but to finance collective goods. Restricted shareholder voting assured that control of the firms' services would not fall into the hands of monopolists or competitors. In effect, the corporations had much the character of consumer cooperatives. This perspective also sheds light on the unusual importance given to the doctrine of ultra vires in the nineteenth century. While current legal and economic scholarship has focused incessantly on the separation between ownership and control, the prior separation between ownership and consumption, accomplished by the late nineteenth century, was another fundamental but generally overlooked turning point in the history of the business corporation. Understanding this transformation throws light not just on historical practices, but also on contemporary debates over deviations from the rule of one-share-one-vote.},

Hermes fervently believed that public control over industry and government would revitalize democratic institutions and eradicate political repression, institutionalized racism, and corporate capitalism. Established in 1941 as a cooperative grocery store for working-class Freret Neighborhood residents, the Consumers’ Co-operative Union (CCU) was the physical manifestation of Hermes’s utopian vision. For more than twenty years, the CCU was a space for exchanging local and national ideas about economic cooperation, racial justice, and political reform. Indeed, Hermes depended on a far-reaching New Deal support network that transcended his neighborhood and bridged political, racial, gender, and class divides. However, this coalition disintegrated in the face of white flight, anti-Communist hysteria, and urban economic decline in the 1950s. I contend that while particular depression-era neighborhood politics nurtured the CCU, larger national economic, political, and cultural trends ultimately confounded the cooperative’s ability to create sustained economic change in Freret. © 2015.

Many MFIs target women because more women than men are poor, especially in rural areas. Studies show that women manage money differently from men and have different leadership styles. Thus, in credit unions and financial firms, female and male managers achieve different results. In microfinance, gender diversity on the board of MFIs is beneficial, and loans authorized by female loan officers have lower default rates. Motivated by these findings, we ask whether MFIs with a female Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are more efficient at serving the poor without jeopardizing financial sustainability. We adapt the banking approach to managerial (in)efficiency to account for the outreach and sustainability goals of the MFIs, and evaluate whether MFIs' outreach efficiency differs by the gender of their respective CEOs. We estimate a stochastic frontier cost function using the Battese-Coelli (1995) model and the "true" random effects estimators using panel data from over 250 MFIs. We find that MFIs with female CEOs have significantly higher outreach efficiency than MFIs with male CEOs. Similar results are found with a two-step stochastic frontier approach. Overall, the results suggest that promoting gender diversity at the top levels of MFI management is likely to have both social and financial benefits. © The Author (2014).},

    abstract = {Consumer co-operatives in Korea have been growing rapidly since they launched their own shops. If co-operatives would be too much oriented to enlargement or economic growth, theymight easily pay no attention tomembers' participation which is one of the priorities in co-operatives. It could lead to losing the value of co-operatives. So it is important to adjust the balance between members' participation and economic growth. This paper focuses on the role of board of directors in doing that. It aims to examine how effectiveness of the board influences members' participation and the participation has effect on performance of co-operatives in the case of iCOOP Korea. The variables such as communication with members and usage of management skills and knowledge are employed asmeasures of the effectiveness of the board in decision-making process. The data are collected by survey the respondents of which are 222 directors of 30 primary co-operatives. It is analyzed by Structural Equation Model. The findings of the research are as follows. Firstly, communication of the board with members increases the members' democratic participation, and the increased participation contributes to improving the financial performance. Secondly, management skills and knowledge of the board does not have significant relations with the level of members' participation, even though members' economic participation has significantly positive relation with the financial performance. The findings imply that members' voluntary participation will be increased when boards of co-operatives try to reflect members' needs in the decision making processes, and it can help the co-operatives improve their financial performance. It suggests a clue for the trade-off between the value of co-operatives and growth of business which many co-operatives are trying to resolve. © 2014 The Authors.},

However, the dynamics and challenges faced by these cooperative organizations have been largely bypassed in the fair trade literature. In this context, this paper aims to unpack the multiple, coexisting and interwoven marketing channels available for small-scale coffee producers, unveiling potential sources of uncertainty and tensions among competing actors and interests, and identifying and assessing the strategies used by organizations to influence farmers' marketing decisions. The analysis comprises two case studies based in the department of Huehuetenango (Guatemala), where the existence of distinct marketing channels combines with processes of product differentiation, namely organic production. Results show the limitations of standard fair trade mechanisms to secure farmers' engagement with cooperative organizations. Rather, technical advice to improve farming practices and quality construction seem to be a more effective mechanism to govern this collective supply chain. Nevertheless, these strategies could be further constrained by productive and organizational factors, affecting the sustainability of potential benefits delivered by these key collective actors. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

I examine how a balance can be achieved in the relationships, and how this can then affect the balance in the economic and social goals of the process areas, all of which can lead to a spillover effect impacting poverty. I also discuss social capital, and its place within co-operative governance. I explore how the relationships and processes influence the building and deployment of social capital by co-operatives to impact poverty at the household and village levels. I conclude by pointing to the importance of now operationalising the theories behind the pathway from co-operative governance to spillover, in order to fully understand its relevance for poverty reduction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Purpose: There are many farmers in rural Ethiopia, who do not join cooperative societies, despite the different technical and financial supports from the government. This study thus aims to investigate the main factors that inspire rural people to join into the cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected relevant primary data from 400 sample households using a special household survey designed for this study. The study also reviewed different secondary materials. The collected data were analyzed using the two-sample t-test principle and cooperative participation probit model. Findings: The finding of the binary choice model illustrates that information access, special skill, membership in rural association, frequency of attending a public meeting/workshop, household head education, credit access, training access, number of family members in school, distance to main market, availability of infrastructures, farmland ownership and farmland sizes are the major explanatory variables that have statistically significant (p-value <0.05) influence on the rural people joining in the cooperative societies in the study areas. Research limitations/implications: This study was based on a cross-sectional survey. As a result, the finding may be subjected to some limitations though the study made all possible efforts to minimize the limitations. Practical implications: Many studies found that cooperatives are a basis for food security. Accordingly, the government can increase a number of cooperative societies in the region by giving more focus to knowledge- and awareness-based instruments like education, information center, rural associations, communication services and roads. These campaigns can attract more people to join the cooperatives and then get the different economic and social advantages from the cooperatives in order to ensure household food security. Originality/value: Some studies found that state, leadership, success history of the cooperative and autonomous status are the most important factors that determine not only the expansion of cooperatives in terms of a number of and types but also for the success of the cooperatives. This study, however, found the importance of information- and knowledge-based mechanisms as a basis to attract more people so that increase in a number of and types of the cooperative societies. Thus, the result of the study is significant for policy makers, social science students, researchers and cooperative societies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

First, although heavily involved in administration, nevertheless managed to find time for fieldwork of this kind. The author contributed to ongoing fieldwork at the CEA, and his results were fed into the teaching through his contribution of interviews, work songs and other material for the Mozambican Miner, later published as Black Gold.

    abstract = {Within a context of known and alarming deterioration of water bodies and under pressure from the European Water Framework Directive, in 2009 the French government designated slightly more than 500 priority catchments. In so doing, it declared its objective of concentrating its efforts on these areas, trying out a methodology for action, and proving to the European Union that it was taking action. The present study has documented the on-going situations and actions on these Grenelle catchment areas and identified the broad types of actions and situations as part of a critical analysis of the approach retained by the government. After constructing an analytical framework of these areas, we assembled together a large collection of data to be analyzed with multivariate statistical analysis. These data were either gathered from surveys based on a questionnaire encompassing biophysical, agricultural, social, and economic aspects or based on spatialized statistical data sources. This work demonstrates key factors characterizing the catchment areas: the hydrological entry point for the definition of a field of action involves great variability of territorial size and therefore of the players involved (municipalities, farmers, cooperatives, users). Little attention is given to this aspect in the relatively rigid single legal procedure presently in force. On these catchment areas, we emphasize two main lines of structuring parameters: on the one hand, the relative diversity of land use and forms of agriculture, and on the other, the relative strength of the administrative structure. These results could be useful for those managing these issues in the different government agencies, those implementing the approaches, or local authorities responsible for resource management, as they provide a better understanding of how to adapt these experiments to other areas concerned by water resource issues. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study investigates why different producers make different choices, looking at both material and immaterial costs and benefits of the two choices. A qualitative study from Chiapas (Mexico) finds that a main reason for not choosing the co-operatives is the production requirements that follow organic certification. A survey on production costs confirms that members of an organic co-operative have more work hours than non-members in the same area. A probit analysis indicates that both coffee plot size and number of working household members influence the producers’ decision on sales channel. However, the study also finds that aspects not related to the organic production requirements can affect the choice, such as the level of trust in co-operative leadership, and the co-operatives’ payment systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

It was found that product-wise highest margin was received from ghee (29.26%) and agencies-wise highest margin was also received from ghee which formed 76% of the total margins earned by distributors. These units margins of milk and milk products are important for policy and decision makers while making policies and developmental programmes related to dairy sector for boosting the economy.},

    abstract = {This topic's interview is primarily aimed at providing the Brazilian public with substantial information and reflection about Movimento da Escola Moderna - a Portuguese association for cooperatively organized teacher self-training on all school levels, operating across the Portuguese territory since the mid-1970's. An interview was therefore conducted with Sérgio Niza, founder and head at the Centro de Formação de Professores and at Escola Moderna, a journal, both of which are connected to Movimento da Escola Moderna. The editorial work was done by Julio Groppa Aquino, an associate professor at Faculdade de Educação da Universidade de São Paulo. Through the in loco dialogue between interviewer and interviewee in September 2012, a sort of historic record comes forth, along with a critical-analytical one, about questions that have been essential to school practice since the return of democracy in Portugal in the 1970s and that seem to match in so many aspects the Brazilian situation and its peculiar inflections. With Movimento da Escola Moderna as the core subject of the interview, Sérgio Niza brings up the proposal of creating spaces for collective training management focused on theoretical-practical reflection about the pedagogic everyday life, offering also a sharp evaluation of the Portuguese education in the last few decades. Moreover, the interview brings us a timely reflection on Escola da Ponte (the Portuguese experience that is best known among Brazilians), as well as lucid considerations about contemporary Brazil, exhorting it to "go much further" in education.},

Using a time-varying probability regime-switching model and monthly data (2000M9-2012M3), we identify two very distinctive regimes: a low mark-up regime (R1) and a high mark-up regime (R2). Without setting any given date a priori, the results from both the regime-switching approach and a sequential search method indicate that the spread exhibits a significant upward shift around early 2008 for all lenders. The estimated switching model controls for the rising wholesale funding costs and changes in global consumer confidence over the sample period. The results show that building societies are generally less inclined to remain in R2 than most banks (particularly foreign subsidiary banks) and some credit unions, and are consequently more likely to offer competitive mortgages to borrowers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

    abstract = {The degradation of product quality is one form of rent dissipation resulting from incomplete property rights in fisheries. Industry structure and information asymmetries can also lead to underinvestment in product quality, even when property rights are well defined. In this article we empirically examine whether the voluntary formation of a marketing cooperative was able to mitigate market failures that led to the production of inferior-quality fish. Specifically, we use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to measure the impact that the Copper River Fishermen's Cooperative, an Alaskan salmon marketing cooperative, had on ex-vessel salmon prices and salmon quality measures. We find that the cooperative was able to improve product quality, as well as attract and sustain a higher price for its salmon. Our findings provide empirical support for many of the key tenets of cooperative theory. Specifically, we find evidence that marketing cooperatives can address existing market failures, that marketing cooperatives can have advantages in high-quality product markets, and that over time, as a result of their success, marketing cooperatives may lead to lasting producer benefits even though they become obsolete due to nonmember free-riding. © The Author (2014).},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine how heads of small charitable performing arts organisations who did not possess backgrounds or qualifications in marketing interpreted the implications, for future marketing activities, of significant cuts in government funding and how their views on the value of marketing changed consequent to the cuts. Design/methodology/approach: Dervin's sensemaking interview method was employed to explore the processes, whereby the heads of 26 small nonprofit contemporary dance companies made sense of the marketing demands of newly constrained funding situations. Findings: Three groups of respondents were identified, respectively, labelled as marketing reductionists, knowledge seekers, and marketing activists. Many of the respondents did not distinguish between marketing and human resource management functions. Major confusions existed vis-à-vis pricing policies and how to evaluate returns on marketing expenditures. Research limitations/implications: The study covered a single sector in just one country. Replication of the study in other sectors and countries would be worthwhile, as would the comparison of how small arts companies deal with various other types of financial crisis. Practical implications: National bodies that award performing arts qualifications need to include marketing in their curricula and syllabuses. Arts marketing associations should make available on their web sites instructional materials relating to marketing. The government should encourage the formation of marketing co-operatives among small performing arts companies. Originality/value: The study applied a qualitative interview technique unfamiliar to most researchers in the marketing field. It was the first to investigate the impact of cutbacks in government funding on the interpretations of marketing held by heads of small arts organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

When a producer cooperative hires wageworkers or welcomes outside directors, one can no longer call that enterprise simply communist or capitalist. Such conflicting relations of production confront enterprise directors with a complex array of distribution pressures. Coexisting class structures create unique tensions between managers, merchants, and other revenue recipients. These contradictions can transform the nature of work. Although the concept of the hybrid has been recognized in class analysis, a systematic study of its forms and dynamics has yet to be developed. A theory of hybrid-directed enterprises reveals that communist class structures can be a spontaneous and successful enterprise component, as well as a catalyst for change today. © 2014, Association for Economic and Social Analysis.},

Consumers in the sample exhibit a large Willingness-to-Pay for renewable energy. Our results also indicate a substantial Willingness-to-Pay for transparent pricing, participation in decision making, and local suppliers. Democratic decision making - a distinct feature of cooperatives - exhibits positive Willingness-to-Pay values for approximately one fifth of the sample. Taken together, our findings suggest a slightly higher Willingness-to-Pay for electricity produced by cooperatives.

The main objective of the study was to identify and analyse factors affecting (constraints) marketing of vegetables among small-scale farmers. Data were collected with structured questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and regression analysis. Results showed that prominent constraints of marketing vegetables among the small-scale farmers were: lack of access to credit, lack of access to storage facilities, lack of market information, lack of finance for farming, poorly developed village markets, poor producer prices, high perishability of produce, low patronage, inadequate access roads, small size of transport and high transportation costs. Variables that significantly influenced monthly net farm income were: gender (t = 3.913), farm size (t = 4.100), number of employees (t = 6.126), access to storage (t =-2.132), grading of products (t = 3.712) and access to extension services (t = 1.757). Recommendations suggested include: enabling accessibility through the development of better infrastructure in the form of storage facilities, roads for transportation and communication systems; and the formation of marketing cooperatives to overcome high transportation costs, small size of transport and individual small marketing output problems in order to attract and penetrate high value-markets. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.},

It proposes an anthropological approach that critically analyzes divisions of labor and the internal factions’ divergent concepts of “community”. In Sicily, workers in “anti-Mafia” co-ops recognize a sense of community and “way of life” in Mafia-influenced mobilizations outside the cooperative environment, contrary to the co-op administrators’ legalistic views of community. The article illuminates how the fact that oft en co-op members draw on different ideas of community can lead to contradictions and tensions, especially as there are different social realities underlying those ideas. © Stichting Focaal and Berghahn Books.},

    abstract = {A whole genome association (WGA) study was carried out to find quantitative trait loci (QTL) for sensory evaluation traits in Hanwoo. Carcass samples of 250 Hanwoo steers were collected from National Agricultural Cooperative Livestock Research Institute, Ansung, Gyeonggi province, Korea, between 2011 and 2012 and genotyped with the Affymetrix Bovine Axiom Array 640K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Among the SNPs in the chip, a total of 322,160 SNPs were chosen after quality control tests. After adjusting for the effects of age, slaughter-year-season, and polygenic effects using genome relationship matrix, the corrected phenotypes for the sensory evaluation measurements were regressed on each SNP using a simple linear regression additive based model. A total of 1,631 SNPs were detected for color, aroma, tenderness, juiciness and palatability at 0.1% comparison-wise level. Among the significant SNPs, the best set of 52 SNP markers were chosen using a forward regression procedure at 0.05 level, among which the sets of 8, 14, 11, 10, and 9 SNPs were determined for the respectively sensory evaluation traits. The sets of significant SNPs explained 18% to 31% of phenotypic variance. Three SNPs were pleiotropic, i.e. AX-26703353 and AX-26742891 that were located at 101 and 110 Mb of BTA6, respectively, influencing tenderness, juiciness and palatability, while AX-18624743 at 3 Mb of BTA10 affected tenderness and palatability. Our results suggest that some QTL for sensory measures are segregating in a Hanwoo steer population. Additional WGA studies on fatty acid and nutritional components as well as the sensory panels are in process to characterize genetic architecture of meat quality and palatability in Hanwoo.

The results emphasize that the principles with high average values and statistical significance in successful cooperatives are democratic management (0.7059), equal economic participation of partners (0.5233), education, training and information (0.4560), cooperation between cooperatives (0.4882) and commitment to the communities (0.3331). A significant correlation (P<0.01) between the IGFE (0.598) and IOE (0.598) with the dependent variable IAP was observed. It was concluded that the application of cooperative principles in the constitution and organization of cooperatives has been a condition of success. © 2014 Universidad del Zulia.

    abstract = {This paper adds to the literature on bank ethics, social movements and stakeholder engagement by presenting ethical banks (EBs) as a countermovement to the process of financialisation. Following the 2008 financial crisis, ethical banks have expanded markedly. Some suggest that this growth is opportunist in nature and reasoned in the public's disenfranchment with commercial banks. However, this paper seeks to demonstrate how British EBs have been, and remain, connected to social movements and civil society organisations (CSOs). It employs a mixed-method approach to review EB coverage in media and to explore three UK-based EBs' connections with CSOs via Social Network Analysis, with the aim to compare them to, and contrast them from, building societies, credit unions and other alternative banks. The link between EBs and CSOs were further examined in interviews with EBs. Findings support the idea of EBs in the UK as countermovement by highlighting how connections with CSOs constrain EBs behaviour, but at the same time give EBs privileged access to niche markets. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

    abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study was to, using a case study research design informed by organizational economics theory, to examine the prospects for micro-insurance in promoting micro-credit in a low-income Anglophone country in sub-Saharan Africa – The Gambia. Two main research questions are addressed: first, what is the most appropriate micro-finance institution (MFI) organizational structure to maximize the economic benefits of micro-insurance? Second, what are the financial management and wider economic benefits of the use of micro-insurance by MFIs? Design/methodology/approach – To address our two research questions, we used a semi-structured interview protocol, informed by the organizational economics literature, to interpret the data collected from our field cases. We believe that these intrinsic qualities of case study methodology are particularly apt in the present study, given the complex and emergent nature of micro-finance and micro-insurance in low-income countries such The Gambia. By focusing on case studies in a single country, we also to some extent help control for variations in business environment that could confound interpretations of field data obtained from different jurisdictions. Findings – The results of our study suggest that the mutual (cooperative) structure of credit unions is likely to be the most cost-efficient and effective organizational form for reducing information asymmetries, agency problems and transaction costs. We also observe that micro-insurance can help reduce the risk of loan defaults, thereby increasing returns on savings and lowering the costs of debt. As such, micro-insurance stimulates the demand–supply of financial intermediation in less developed countries and so helps promote economic development. In addition to contributing new insights, our findings have potentially important commercial and public policy implications. Research limitations/implications – We acknowledge that our research is subject to inherent limitations such as the focus on three interviews in three different types of MFI organization while excluding other structural forms of organization such as government-owned/sponsored organizations. Nonetheless, the organizational characteristics of the cases examined in the present study are representative of most MFIs in developing countries. Given the prevalent hierarchical nature of corporate systems in sub-Saharan Africa, the views of the interviewees are also deemed to reflect those of other board members. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the conclusions from our research may need to be tempered in line with these inherent limitations with the research approach adopted. Practical implications – The insights obtained from our Gambia-based research could be generalized to developing countries elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, and indeed, other parts of the developing world. Consequently, the study could be of interest and relevance to international financiers (e.g. the World Bank), aid agencies, governments and other development organizations. Originality/value – Despite its evident business and development potential, academic management research on micro-insurance, and in particular, its role in supporting micro-finance initiatives, is still very much at an embryonic stage. Our study thus seeks to fill this knowledge gap. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {In this paper the economics of seasonal production of cheese in the mountain in Norway is investigated and compared with keeping the cows at the farm, investing in a common pasture or in co-operative dairy farming. The comparison is based on calculations in a linear programming (LP) farm model supported with Stochastic Dominance with Respect to a Function (SDRF) for risk analysis. Mountain dairy farming involves free ranging cows on natural pastures for about 70 days. The contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, CLA and various antioxidants in the milk increase when cows graze alpine pastures affecting its processing properties, and flavor and chemical content of dairy products. Seasonal mountain cheese production is found to be generally preferable to the other alternatives for risk neutral as well as risk-averse decision makers. This is due to a higher price for mountain products, subsidy payments for mountain farming, and exemption for farm processed milk in the national milk quota. The risks are partly price risks but also yield and output risks as well as downside political risks since the profitability depend strongly on subsidies and premiums, and exemption for farmprocessed milk in the milk quota. Investments in farming co-operatives were unprofitable due to less subsidy payments compared to individual farmers. Effects of calving time, introducing fertilized pastures or night pens, and supplementary feeding to extend the mountain period and sustain milk yields are examined. The premium price for "mountain products", animal welfare, and farmer co-operation on marketing are discussed.},

It has been argued that the cooperative movement developed in areas where small and middle-sized farms were relatively important.

The prior importance of institutions built around the use and management of collective resources is explored as an alternative proxy for social capital in pre-industrial economies. The results show that the social networks built around common lands and irrigation communities were a key element, together with relatively high levels of human capital and the existence of a wide layer of middle size farms, in facilitating the emergence of the cooperative movement in rural areas. © 2012 European Historical Economics Society.},

The empirical study takes as a reference the horticultural sector in southeast Spain, since this area constitutes the highest concentration of small-scale farm production in Europe, where the climatic conditions allow the possibility of several harvests in year-round production, as well as several alternative crops. Firstly, we study the production programming for an individual farmer, under the assumption that their decisions do not affect the balance of market prices. In this case a modified Markowitz model is used for the scheduling of crop marketing. Secondly, we study the sales arrangements for a farming-marketing cooperative, under the assumption that their sales volume is such that the entity is capable of altering the market balance. A model of monthly revenues and margins is proposed, and the results show a clear improvement in both margins and revenues if the harvest is programmed in this way. © 2011 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).},

Furthermore, farmers with larger bargaining power have less willingness to sell their product to the cooperative.

The selection of enterprises has been implemented on base of differentness in the enterprise form, in the acreage of managed farm land and a differentiation of the enterprise subject. From a comparison of volume and structure of the supports it results that an agricultural cooperative uses a wide spectrum of particular types of subsidies, which is caused by a big acreage of almost 7 800 ha with orientation to both the plant and the animal productions. Similar situation is in the valued joint-stock company. Without received subsidies the economy of private farmer would be unprofitable in both the years. In monitoring it was proved that differentiation of enterprise activity in form of raw material process in excess of framework of agricultural basic industry decreases dependence of the income from operations on obtained financial means in form of supports. From the mentioned facts it is obvious that the received financial subsidies significantly positively influenced the operating results of all agricultural enterprises where the basic activity subject is plant and animal production.

Th e paper aims at a better understanding what market conditions and transaction attributes have favoured the emergence and the success of the Czech milk marketing cooperatives as well as if their current objectives and strategies are suffi cient for securing their future success. Th e methodological approach rests largely in the theory of industrial organisation combined with the new institutional economics. Establishing marketing cooperatives, dairy farmers balanced market power with processing industry. It is showed on six case studies that the Czech milk marketing cooperatives follow traditional objectives (securing sales, fair price and payment discipline); however, their priorities and strategies diff er according to their market environment. If the concentration of the dairy industry continues, there will be a need for reconsidering the objectives of milk marketing cooperatives toward a more vertical coordination in the dairy chain.},

It, therefore, analyses a self-governance initiative by a Dutch farmers' association from two theoretical perspectives: Ostrom's institutional design principles and insights from the politics of self-governance. Whereas, Ostrom's principles focus on arranging interactions between the members of a self-governing community and their common resources, the focus of the politics literature is on the negotiations between the community and the governmental authorities to obtain room for self-governance. The paper reveals how the arrangements within the association influenced the negotiation between this community and the involved authorities, and vice versa. This mutual relationship can both positively and negatively influence the accomplishment of self-governance. Adequate self-governance arrangements can help to convince policy-makers to provide room in existing policies to accommodate self-governance. Conversely, policy-makers can help to set conditions for designing successful arrangements. Otherwise, both processes can negatively reinforce each other, and this can result in stalemates and blockades. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {The study explores the determinants of credit union (CU) savings in Ghana and finds that credit risk, assets (size) and female membership are significant determinants of CU savings. Whereas a rise in CU credit risk increases CU savings, a rise in female membership as well as CU assets is characterised by a fall in CU savings. The study, therefore, argues that CUs in Ghana could maximise their savings if they target their savings- mobilisation campaigns at income-earning men with higher marginal propensity to save coupled with the adoption of an effective and efficient asset management policy. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = {This article is based on research conducted within the program POSDRU 2007-2013, Prometeus - Promoting Social Economy în Romania through Research, Education and Professional Formation at the European Standards. The inquiry offers what we consider to be the first synthesis of the evolution of Romanian cooperatives from the perspective of social economy. The article presents relevant information for understanding and explaining the conditions that facilitated both successes and failures of rural and urban cooperatives in Romania. The study reveals an unprecedented aspect of cooperatives precursors associated to the pre modern trade and with the precursors of the merchants that operate on the capitalist market, the fact that they had a fundamental moral resource: the mutual trust of the stakeholder partners. The capitalist merchants involved in mass trade that would eventually form a consistent part of the Romanian cooperative members would have been rather interested to gain money, to surpass the problems of the competition, than to cultivate with priority the principles of honesty, fair play, mutual trust, as part of the professional ethos. Thus, a moral resource indispensable to business, part of the moral profile of the cooperative stakeholders, available in the practice of the middle class precursors, was no longer as resuscitated and converted into social capital of the merchants and manufacturers confronting on the free market, being partly lost on the way. The precarious state of agricultural productivity was a poor source of expansion for the cooperative associations. The most visible expression of the absence of major stimulants for the development of the cooperative movement in agriculture was the presence of an explosive germ within the rural social structure where over 80% of the active population worked: the absolute majority (51.1%) of the auxiliary members of the families of agricultural workers and the relative majority consisting of the self-employed small agricultural workers (34.3%). The practice of subsistence agriculture within a family system with an active population overwhelmingly consisting of the family members that are helping the household head to perform a primate exploitation of the land drastically limited the opportunities to build and consolidate a vigorous cooperative movement. We discuss arguments presented by recognized experts concerning the identity of cooperatives as an institution of social economy: its finalities, relations between the normative state and the cooperative autonomy, types and frequencies of cooperative units, levels of participation of village and urban population to the cooperative movement. The article proposes a starting point for a debate concerning cooperation in relation to the dynamic of population needs, comparing cooperative politics versus real associative life, in the problematic context of social economy. We question the links between credit co operations, economic (production) co operations and the country level of economic development. We also bring into question the hopeless situation of the small agricultor on the market of agricultural products. We discuss the effect of administrative tutelage on cooperation, as well as a series of durable management deficits in the life of cooperative organizations. The study sheds light on limitations of cooperative autonomy due to interventions of powerful social actors.},

    abstract = {This study examines the impact of rural electrification through extension of existing grid on rural micro-enterprises in Niger Delta, Nigeria. The study used purposive sampling and obtained data using structured questionnaires and personal interviews with the owners of the micro-enterprises. From the data, summary information was obtained and the impact of connection to grid-electricity on the micro-enterprises was examined using a log-linear regression model. The result shows that although not statistically significant, on average, enterprises in communities connected to the electricity grid are 16.2% more profitable than enterprises in communities not connected to the grid, and the use of generating sets in providing back-up electricity makes micro-enterprises more profitable. The study also observed that micro-enterprise owners are fully aware of the importance of electricity access to the profitability of their businesses and those who can afford to buy generating sets willingly do so. Incidentally, the total expenditure on generating sets by some enterprises is up to three times (3. ×) the tariff for grid-electricity in rural areas. The high cost of self-generated electricity increases the total cost of doing business in rural areas thus reducing the profit margin of the micro-enterprises. In conclusion, for rural electrification to be more effective in improving the living standard of rural dwellers, the larger problem of increasing the national generating capacity and the availability of grid-electricity should be tackled, and rural electrification programs should be carried out alongside other programs that reduce the barriers to establishing micro-enterprises like the creation of rural agricultural co-operatives to promote the productive use of electricity. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.},

They highlighted that smallholders' market access improves not only as a result of SMCs networking and negotiation with key actors in the public and private sectors, but also due to improved interrelationships among SMCs and other types of Farmers' Organizations (FOs). Peer-to-peer relationships with other SMCs are critical for mutual learning, collaboration and collective action.Practical implications: Peer-to-peer relationships among SMCs are crucial for them to overcome the internal and external social dilemmas SMCs are bound to face while improving smallholders' market access. This goes beyond the three kinds of relationships that scholars have pointed out thus far needed for effective FO development (relationships with members; the public sector and civil society; and with market players). This can be promoted and supported by development programmes.Originality/value: Most SMC studies concentrate primarily on their efficiency in production and marketing activities. This research proposes looking beyond this perspective, using a qualitative approach to explore the real-life experiences and views of actors involved. © 2012 Copyright Wageningen University.},

In materials that have significant localized and itinerant spins, it is not obvious which will induce order. We combine electrical transport, X-ray magnetic diffraction, and photoemission studies with band structure calculations to characterize successive antiferromagnetic transitions in GdSi. GdSi has both sizable local moments and a partially nested Fermi surface, without confounding contributions from orbital effects. We identify a route to incommensurate order where neither type of moment dominates, but is rooted in cooperative feedback between them. The nested Fermi surface of the itinerant electrons induces strong interactions between local moments at the nesting vector, whereas the ordered local moments in turn provide the necessary coupling for a spindensity wave to form among the itinerant electrons. This mechanism echoes the cooperative interactions between electrons and ions in charge-density-wave materials, and should be germane across a spectrum of transition-metal and rare-earth intermetallic compounds.},

The main objective is to show the importance of Cocrefocapi to finance sugarcane suppliers from Piracicaba, analyzing the influence of some factors in the decision of sugarcane suppliers, in order to choose this cooperative as the main financing institution. Two econometric models of qualitativeresponse and a set of descriptive analysis were developed in this study. Results show that the land size is one factor which should be included when the demand for agricultural credit is analyzed. In addition, the econometric evidence shows that, bigger participation in the institutional capital of Cocrefocapi is not a factor which incentives members to borrow money in this Cooperative. On the other hand, although sugarcane suppliers who took loans in Cocrefocapi have chosen this institution because of lower transaction costs, results demonstrate that many of these people took loans in other institutions because they had other economic activities, which are not financed by Cocrefocapi.},

I show that the cooperative blends market-like attributes with hierarchy-like mechanisms and thus should be viewed as a true hybrid rather than as an intermediate form.

We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members.

First, despite the help and support by the government, the cooperative sector has not been able to play a major role in the development of the country and its share has not exceeded 3% of development program. The main aim of this study is identifying the factors affecting the participation of Shirvan-Chardavol township’s agricultural cooperatives’ members.; Approach: This casual comparative applied research which uses survey method for data accumulation, is of Quasi-experimental research type because of impossibility of controlling the research variables. A researcher-made questionnair was used as the main tool for gathering data. The face and content validity of the questionnaire were confirmed by a group of university professors and cooperative experts; also the reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed through calculating the Kronbach alfa coefficient (a = 0.80).; Results: The statistical society of the research included 751 active members of Shirvan-Chardavol township’s agricultural cooperatives, among which 260 people were selected for the study using classified proportional random sampling method and with the aid of Morgan sample-volume table. Data processing was performed using SPSS estatistial software, as well as descriptive estatistics (central and inferential indexes) and analytical estatistics (correlation coefficients and stepwise multiple regression analysis).; Conclusion: The correlation coefficient results show that there is significant relationship between the variables like age, background history of membership in cooperatives, the members’ agricultural land areas, annual income of the members, socio-cultural features, economical features, educational-extensional features, managerial factors, psychological features, political factors and communicational-informational factors from the one hand and the dependent variable of agricultural cooperatives’ members’ level of participation from the other. The multiple regression analysis results showed that variables like political, economic, managerial and social factors have positive effect on the dependent variable of agricultural cooperatives’ members’ participation, describing 65% of the changes of the mentioned dependent variable. © 2011 Science Publications.},

In addition, it was also found that factors that affected the opportunity cost of maintaining status quo, including the value of the land on which the co-op scheme sits and the real option value of redevelopment, had a significant impact on the timing of the dissolution of the co-op.

Findings: Analysis of questionnaire responses of 493 customers of banks and credit unions indicated that satisfaction, cognitive, affective, conative, and action loyalty are positively related to fortitude. Research limitations/implications: The Beyond Loyalty Model (BLM) does not address important strategic issues often associated with loyalty, such as firm profitability, complaint resolution, and firm profitability. Practical implications: This research is the first to find that customers of financial institutions acquire satisfaction and strong loyalty ties with their bank or credit union after dealing with their financial services provider for a relatively short period of time. Thus financial institutions should consistently seek relationship-building opportunities from the outset of their relationships with their customers. Originality/value: The resulting Beyond Loyalty Model (BLM) improves upon the American Bankers Association's ABA Financial Client Satisfaction Index, and is a means by which financial institutions can monitor and enhance the satisfaction, loyalty, and fortitude of the customers of financial institutions. Further, the increasing acceptance of virtual banking calls for additional study of this area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Between 1950 and 2010, the British co-operative movement faced a series of commercial, structural, and corporate governance crises. Having pioneered many of the features of modern large-scale retailing since its origins in the mid-nineteenth century, from the 1950s the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) and the retail cooperative societies it served experienced plummeting market share, continued internecine rivalries, and increasing marginalization. In the early twenty-first century, however, co-operatives improved their market share and experienced a Renaissance in commercial fortunes despite continued fierce competition in food retailing. As yet there has been little exploration of the nature of this turnaround and the ways in which the once-foundering co-operative business model was re-engineered.Drawing on new research into the CWS (renamed The Co-operative Group in 2001), this article provides a historical analysis of the movement's decline and revival. As the article details, from the 1950s significant efforts were made to reform CWS and the movement as a whole. However, co-operatives were slow to adapt to the changing business environment, hampered by dysfunctional organizational dynamics that constrained structural change and limited efforts to compete with private retail multiples. Following an unsuccessful takeover bid for CWS in 1997, co-operative opinion coalesced around the need for change. In the final section, the authors analyze the factors underpinning the Renaissance, focusing on both organizational innovations and the reassertion of core values and principles on which co-operation had been built. This provides a fascinating illustration of how a business can respond effectively to internal and external challenges, yet retain its fundamental character. © 2013 The Author.},

    abstract = {In the 1990s, an expansion of small-scale (farm) forestry in medium to low rainfall areas was considered to be an important part of increasing the national forest estate but it remains a very minor source of timber, largely confined to the higher rainfall areas. In most areas, returns from timber are much less than for alternative land uses, even with low discount rates. If however, there are additional returns from plantation grazing and carbon sequestration and there are other potential management gains, multiple use plantations may be more attractive. The goal of this study is to estimate the net present values of multiple use spotted gum plantations in a medium rainfall area of southeast Queensland. For the case study, production, carbon sequestration and emissions data were supplemented by formal and informal interviews with landholders, sawmill staff and government extension personnel. Forest inventory, biomass and soil sampling, and stakeholder interviews were used as sources of primary data. The costs and benefits data were converted into monetary terms and discounted to produce net present values. Evaluations in this study identify the optimal rotation age of plantations to be 33-34 years. This is the case if including carbon and stock values, and using either farm- or factory-gate timber prices. The net present value increases significantly however if farmers harvest the trees themselves. In addition, at harvesting age, it was found that carbon and stock had the potential to account for 19.2 and 11.4% respectively of the total returns from spotted gum plantations. Policy initiatives to support the farm forestry sub-sector should include pricing greenhouse gas emissions and developing and strengthening farmers co-operatives and marketing institutions to enhance farmers' bargaining power. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

According to the results it can be seen that the real motivation for the development of cooperatives is farmers’ demands and the demands come from farmers’ pursuit of interests in forest industry. Cooperatives in China are still in the early stage of development, and the cooperative laws cannot cover all the basic features of the forestry and the cooperatives. Therefore, the relevant laws and guarantee systems for resource exploitation and management, publicity and demonstration, forestry technology training as well as the preferential policies such as tax breaks, are needed for the sound development of China’s forestry cooperation organization. © 2013 Estonian University of Life Sciences.

    abstract = {This article explores the women weavers of Manipur by using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. In mainstream India, males play the major role in weaving while women are involved in pre-weaving activity. In contrast to this, in the north-eastern states of India, especially Manipur, the weaving occupation is dominated by women, who often perform the dual roles of producer and trader. There are no power looms or cloth mills in the state even today, and these women weavers are to be credited for preserving Manipur's heritage by laboriously producing traditional textiles by hand. Globalisation and the opening of global markets may require their skills and knowledge to be upgraded to face the competition, and this study is an attempt to understand the world of the women weavers of Manipur in the context of a changing society. Their integral role in an industrially backward state is reflected in the lives of the 300 women selected for this study, which examines their socioeconomic conditions; the advantages and disadvantages associated with their working conditions; aspects of their health, wages and aspirations; their social relations with family and community; as well as the changing market structure, the technology used and production. Thus, an exploration of the women weavers' lives becomes a matter of acknowledging their contribution to society in the performance of their duties and roles according to their capacity, culture and traditions. © 2012 SAGE Publications.},

It created the atmosphere of not having the accountability, transparency and flexibility which leaded to corruption in co-operative organization. The quantitative data has indicated that the tri-party co-operative management was lack of integration, shiftless, incompetency of modem management. They were not being able to understand the spirits of team building management. The principles of good governance were not used.

    abstract = {In negotiations over land-right acquisitions, landowners have an informational advantage over conservation groups because they know more about the opportunity costs of conservation measures on their sites. This advantage creates the possibility that landowners will demand payments greater than the required minimum, where this minimum required payment is known as the landowner's willingness to accept (WTA). However, in recent studies of conservation costs, researchers have assumed landowners will accept conservation with minimum payments. We investigated the ability of landowners to demand payments above their WTA when a conservation group has identified multiple sites for protection. First, we estimated the maximum payment landowners could potentially demand, which is set when groups of landowners act as a cooperative. Next, through the simulation of conservation auctions, we explored the amount of money above landowners' WTA (i.e., surplus) that conservation groups could cede to secure conservation agreements, again investigating the influence of landowner cooperatives. The simulations showed the informational advantage landowners held could make conservation investments up to 42% more expensive than suggested by the site WTAs. Moreover, all auctions resulted in landowners obtaining payments greater than their WTA; thus, it may be unrealistic to assume landowners will accept conservation contracts with minimum payments. Of particular significance for species conservation, conservation objectives focused on overall species richness, which therefore recognize site complementarity, create an incentive for landowners to form cooperatives to capture surplus. To the contrary, objectives in which sites are substitutes, such as the maximization of species occurrences, create a disincentive for cooperative formation. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.},

    abstract = {Self-interest frequently causes individuals engaged in joint enterprises to choose actions that are counterproductive. Free-riders can invade a society of cooperators, causing a tragedy of the commons. Such social dilemmas can be overcome by positive or negative incentives. Even though an incentive-providing institution may protect a cooperative society from invasion by free-riders, it cannot always convert a society of free-riders to cooperation. In the latter case, both norms, cooperation and defection, are stable: To avoid a collapse to full defection, cooperators must be sufficiently numerous initially. A society of free-riders is then caught in a social trap, and the institution is unable to provide an escape, except at a high, possibly prohibitive cost. Here, we analyze the interplay of (a) incentives provided by institutions and (b) the effects of voluntary participation. We show that this combination fundamentally improves the efficiency of incentives. In particular, optional participation allows institutions punishing free-riders to overcome the social dilemma at a much lower cost, and to promote a globally stable regime of cooperation. This removes the social trap and implies that whenever a society of cooperators cannot be invaded by free-riders, it will necessarily become established in the long run, through social learning, irrespective of the initial number of cooperators. We also demonstrate that punishing provides a "lighter touch" than rewarding, guaranteeing full cooperation at considerably lower cost.},

The results showed no analysis of product classification that causes the cooperatives fail to recognize how to control the quantity of the incoming and outgoing stocks appropriately. The results also showed no demand forecasting, resulting that certain products were ordered in higher quantity than stock demand on respective period, thereby affecting the evaluation of the inventory management performance, leading to a loss to certain kind of products, increased logistics cost, and deviation of data calculated for reserve management variables. In this study, the results also demonstrated that reserve management on the basis of order quantity can improve the effectiveness and reduce the ordering cost and reserve cost.

    abstract = {Co-operatives have been likened to a 'network of contracts' or 'coalition'. This is particularly the case for 'producer owned' co-operatives that have small business operators such as farmers as their members. Although there has been some research into the strategic networking of co-operatives, there has been little attention given to the network behaviour and benefits to small firms as members of co-operatives, in particular to the benefits, risks and management issues associated with such networks. This research draws on case study data from Australian and French producer co-operatives to examine how small firms use co-operatives as a strategic network. It uses a conceptual framework for small firm alliances and networks originally developed by Street and Cameron (2007), and examines three research questions proposed in that study along with three interrelated theories (the resource based view, resource dependency and punctuated equilibrium). The study finds support for the conceptual framework and the theories as useful research tools. It also provides insights into the way small firms can use co-operatives to secure access to resources and mitigate environmental risk. However, the sustainability of these co-operatives is contingent effective network management, adaptability and the maintenance of member trust and loyalty. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Cotton, both a source of livelihood for millions of poor rural households and a major source of export revenues, is a vital commodity for the economic and social development of Mali. Inefficiencies in the Malian cotton system at the ginnery and producers' cooperative levels (e.g., late payment to farmers and poorly functioning credit schemes) have recently led to an important decline in supply, threatening the sustainability of the sector. Using regional data from 1998/1999 to 2008/2009, this study aims to quantitatively assess the contribution of key determinants, such as cotton prices and timely payment, toward the downward trend in cotton area. A dynamic supply model, based on adaptive expectations and partial adjustment, is employed to estimate the effects of prices and institutional factors, such as credit recovery rates and date of payment to farmers, on the Malian cotton supply. Results show that supply responds significantly to cotton prices relative to cereal and fertilizer prices. Date of payment varies across agricultural cycles and late payment negatively influences land devoted to cotton. Low credit repayment rates create disincentives to grow cotton. Therefore, the revitalization of the Malian cotton sector depends upon getting both prices and institutions right. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the development of new model farmer cooperatives set up with Aid agency assistance in Shandan County, Gansu Province, China, focusing on enterprise management and training, and the monitoring and evaluation issues and outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a case study of two projects that integrated participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) methodology into both field practice and institutional development. The project evaluation data were collected from semi-structured interviews, observation and secondary sources. Findings: The cooperatives increased community income through collectively improving members' production and marketing capabilities. As well as economic benefits, the Shandan cooperatives show improvements in social collaboration that include enhanced inter- and intra-family relationships, community harmony and raised status for women. Research limitations/implications: The cooperatives have only operated since the new co-op law was enacted 1 July 2007. While the findings are preliminary, planned ongoing evaluation for the Shandan co-ops will review the sustainability of the economic and social gains made. Practical implications: The lessons learned from the participatory approach to improve rural cooperative development in Shandan County are relevant to researchers and practitioners, and can be applied by rural communities throughout China. Originality/value: Although the new style cooperatives have the potential to improve the rural economy, leading to poverty reduction and social development, there have been few case studies of the establishment and progress of these enterprises in China's poorer regions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This was a cross-sectional study conducted on 400 individuals who were selected randomly based on cluster sampling procedure from all active cooperatives in the province. The data were collected using a questionnaire. In all three cooperatives, number of respondents attended in high priority educational needs courses in common trainings were very few. In this respect, only 35.4% (few) and 6.1% (very few) of the respondents have respectively passed courses on accounting of cooperatives (basic) and marketing and market management as the first and second needs mentioned in common trainings. In industrial cooperatives the "production management" course has the highest priority among the respondents that 1.1% of them passed this course. Among the agricultural cooperatives, the "management of broiler farms" has the highest priority with 2.6 participation percentage. Comparison of the training needs and participation rate of technical and vocational training courses in agricultural, industrial and service cooperatives in Kermanshah province showed small agreement between these two items; such that the findings indicate a trial and error approach in educational policy decision making. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

    abstract = {Humans extensively help others altruistically, which plays an important role in maintaining cooperative societies. Although some nonhuman animals are also capable of helping others altruistically, humans are considered unique in our voluntary helping and our variety of helping behaviors. Many still believe that this is because only humans can understand others' goals due to our unique "theory of mind" abilities, especially shared intentionality. However, we know little of the cognitive mechanisms underlying helping in nonhuman animals, especially if and how they understand others' goals. The present study provides the empirical evidence for flexible targeted helping depending on conspecifics' needs in chimpanzees. The subjects of this study selected an appropriate tool from a random set of seven objects to transfer to a conspecific partner confronted with differing tooluse situations, indicating that they understood what their partner needed. This targeted helping, (i.e., selecting the appropriate tool to transfer), was observed only when the helpers could visually assess their partner's situation. If visual access was obstructed, the chimpanzees still tried to help their partner upon request, but failed to select and donate the appropriate tool needed by their partner. These results suggest that the limitation in chimpanzees' voluntary helping is not necessarily due to failure in understanding others' goals. Chimpanzees can understand conspecifics' goals and demonstrate cognitively advanced targeted helping as long as they are able to visually evaluate their conspecifics' predicament. However, they will seldom help others without direct request for help.},

Despite ever more marked deviations of leftist political platforms from the centralised model of the URSS, it is clear that self-management has not taken the place of central planning in Marxist plans for the future. In contrast, the author will come up with evidence that an analysis of the self-managed firm system may offer clues for a critical discussion of major points of Marxian theory, including the labour theory of value, alienation, dialectics or the subject-object inversion in capitalism. Accordingly, in the individual sections of this paper each of these central aspects of Marxian theory will be separately addressed in the light of insights flowing from the economic theory of producer cooperatives. © The Author 2012.

    abstract = {At the heart of one of the most densely populated mega-cities of India lies an eco-friendly and sustainable developmental business model. The city in question is Kolkata and the profitable but environmentally friendly venture that will be highlighted in this paper is that of wastewater-fed aquaculture practiced by a cooperative run by the local fishermen, namely Mudialy Fisherman's Cooperative Society (MFCS). Initially the marshy wetlands of Mudialy used to be flooded with polluted waste water from the city and the local industrial complex. Ultimately, the polluted water was released to the sacred River Ganges. This cooperative society has radically transformed these wetlands into an urban fishery and a water-front recreational ecosystem. The present paper focuses on the incredible task completed by the MFCS and also reports the results of water-quality analyses to ascertain that conditions in the water bodies of MFCS are ideal for a profitable aquaculture practice. All the water quality parameters studied (physicochemical water parameters, concentration of different heavy metals, and zooplankton community structure) were well within the normal limits from the point of view of pisciculture. This proves the efficiency of the wastewater purification system adopted by the cooperative society. The major advantage of wastewater-fed aquaculture over conventional wastewater treatment is the large diversity of marketable products and therefore broad possibilities of income generation. Thanks to the poor fishermen of MFCS, the water drained from these wetlands into the River Ganges is no longer polluted. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The purpose of this research is to study the needs and opportunities for agricultural credit in the Adana region (675,000 ha including 223,000 irrigated). In the region farms have a very intensive production, with large input requirements and investments. In addition, prices and product yields fluctuate with weather conditions, market conditions, as well as farmers' choices to certain specialized production, which causes a large fluctuation in farm income. This offset can cause additional problems. On the other hand, traditional or modern family expenses, increase with urbanization. This phenomenon, coupled with a general increase in agricultural production costs, are causing a severe shortage of working capital to the farmer, who then sees the increase on its credit requirements. Normally, agricultural credit is mainly provided by the State agencies (Agricultural Bank, Agricultural Cooperatives). Indeed, this system is cheaper for farmers because the interest rates charged are well below the inflation rate but it requires guarantees, formality restrict the volume of loans actually granted, especially for small farmers. Thus, the latter to torment a parallel range of credit (loan shark, firms, non-agricultural banks, etc.) or the interest rate is generally very high and the formalities for obtaining less painful.},

Koperasi Unit Desa (KUDs) -in Indonesian, or Village Unit Cooperative (VUC) have been entrusted with the marketing of rice paddies although their performance has always been less than satisfactory. One problem experienced by the KUDs is not having sufficient cash to purchase and process paddies into rice. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a simulation model to represent cash flows during one paddy plantation season for a KUD (VUC). The simulation model is a decision support tool that enables a KUD's (VUC) management to determine the maximum quantity of paddies to be purchased; the minimum borrowing and additional borrowing; and the earnings before taxes. An investigator-administrated questionnaire was used to collect historical data of the twenty randomly selected KUDs (VUC) on Lombok Island to validate the sub-models of the simulation model. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit (two-sample), linear regression, correlation and t- tests were used to validate the simulation model. The validation results have shown that the sub-models of the simulation model are valid, and these may contribute to the valid results of the simulation model. This study has found that the limitations of the paddy storage building, drying floor, and milling machine owned by the KUDs (VUC) may restrict the KUDs (VUC) from buying the entire paddies harvested. Therefore, further research is needed to find out the minimum capacities of those facilities enabling the KUDs (VUC) to work efficiently.},

    abstract = {Agricultural systems are embedded in wider social-ecological processes that must be considered in any complete discussion of sustainable agriculture. Just as climatic profiles will influence the future viability of crops, institutions, i.e., governance agreements, rural household and community norms, local associations, markets, and agricultural ministries, to name but a few, create the conditions that foster sustainable food systems. Because discussions of agricultural sustainability often overlook the full range of social dimensions, we propose a dual focus on a broad set of criteria, i.e., human health, labor, democratic participation, resiliency, biological and cultural diversity, equity, and ethics, to assess social outcomes, and on institutions that could support diversified farming systems (DFS). A comparative analysis of case studies from California's Central Valley, Mesoamerican coffee agroforestry systems, and European Union agricultural parks finds that DFS practices are unevenly adopted within and among these systems and interdependent with institutional environments that specifically promote diversified farming practices. Influential institutions in these cases include state policies, farmers' cooperatives/associations, and organized civic efforts to influence agroenvironmental policy, share knowledge, and shape markets for more 'sustainable' products. The Californian and Mesoamerican cases considers organic and fair trade certifications, finding that although they promote several DFS practices and generate social benefits, they are inadequate as a single strategy to promote agricultural sustainability. The complex governance and multifunctional management of Europe's peri-urban agricultural parks show unexpected potential for promoting DFS. Unless DFS are anchored in supportive institutions and evaluated against an inclusive set of social and environmental criteria, short-term investments to advance diversified agriculture could miss a valuable opportunity to connect ecological benefits with social benefits in the medium and long terms. © 2012 by the author(s).},

Explanations have been put forward, comprising a variety of economic and sociological theories.

It is claimed that the problems are due to the members having increasingly little trust in the cooperatives and in each other. The cooperatives' decision makers have no instruments for estimating how much social capital is lost when they pursue strategies of vertical and horizontal integration. Therefore, they do not consider this loss in their calculations. Thus, the problems caused by the cooperatives' vaguely defined property rights are becoming increasingly serious.

    abstract = {How do Canadian banks integrate environmental risks into corporate lending and where are they located compared with their global peers? In this paper we report a mixed method analysis of the integration of environmental risks into the credit management. The qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest that all analyzed Canadian commercial banks, credit unions and Export Development Canada manage environmental risks in credit management to avoid financial risks. Some of the institutions even connect environmental and sustainability issues with their general business strategies. Compared with other countries, Canadian banks are best in class, as all six Canadian commercial banks, comprising over 90 percent of Canadian assets, systematically examine environmental risks for credits, loans and mortgages. We conclude that Canadian banks are proactive regarding environmental examinations of loans and that there is a need for a more accountancy related reporting on environmental risk management in financial institutions. Further research is needed to be able to calculate costs and benefits of integrating environmental and sustainability issues into the credit risk management. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

    abstract = {Cooperatives are of particular interest to economists because of their unique ownership structure and the incentives this structure creates. In addition to the so-called property rights problems (e.g., free-rider, horizon, and portfolio problems), the analysis of agricultural cooperatives has focused on issues of market power, agency, product quality, and increasingly producer and consumer heterogeneity. These last three elements are important features of the industrialization of the agrifood system. This article highlights the key concepts required for examination of cooperatives now and in the future and incorporates these concepts into a framework that can be used to examine the myriad situations and problem settings in which agricultural cooperatives are likely to be found. A key finding of the paper is that the procompetitive and distributional impacts of cooperatives depend critically on the sensitivity of price in the downstream retail market, the nature of the cooperative's governance structure, and the open or closed nature of cooperative membership. The article also provides a discussion of new areas in which an understanding of cooperatives and collective action would be valuable, as well as a discussion of the applicability of the proposed framework to these areas. © 2013 by Annual Reviews.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the research is to identify the observable operational and supply chain barriers and constraints that occur in local food supply chains, especially with smaller producers, as they seek to increase market penetration across a wider geographic area. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopts a multiple case study approach using mixed methods of data collection where case study companies are interviewed and complete a questionnaire. This process allows us to create a supply chain map and create a narrative which records the burdens and impacts occurring in local food supply chains and smaller producers looking beyond local markets. This evidence is then set against the theory of constraints (TOC) to provide a theoretical underpinning and to examine consistency of the findings. Findings: Seven broad categories of constraint type are observed: constraints due to the nature of the market; due to scale and the nature of products; constraints related to employment and skills; institutional constraints; constraints in supply chain relationships; certification, policy and regulatory constraints; and constraints around personal beliefs and anthropomorphism. Each is described as to its origin, its limitation to business and where possible, how it might be remedied. The constraints point to some counter-intuitive results as far as common perceptions of local food are concerned but suggestions for improvement are made through collaborative producer efforts, alternative institutional intervention, supply chain re-engineering and logistics innovation. Practical implications: Practical suggestions are made to improve the inclusiveness of distribution networks, to better utilise regional food groups (RFGs), to develop opportunities to set up autonomous supply chain centres, or to broaden the function of farmer co-operatives. The paper also provides an alternative model of the TOC specifically adapted for local food producers, the focus of which plays to their strengths and focuses on building competencies across, up and down the supply chain. Originality/value: The adaptation of the TOC provides an advancement of knowledge in the area of food supply chain analysis and is done in a way that is more practical in use. The paper also provides the opportunity to take a similar approach to examining other niche supply opportunities in the sector, which may be dependent on other geographically defined barriers, such as seasonal or ethnic products. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This article argues that the dividend, though important, was only one aspect of financial assistance co-operative retail societies offered their members. By focusing on the period of the 1920s-40s, it explores how collective strength and mutual aid provided by societies extended to financial support during periods of economic crisis and industrial action. Credit in times of need was especially important for members of societies affected by trade depression, industrial crisis and unemployment during the interwar years. The article also argues that membership could give access to much wider support than is typically associated with the retail aspect of co-operative societies. For example, societies assisted individual members, or the families of members, during periods of illness and death. The article highlights how, as trading organisations, the spirit of mutual help within co-operative retail societies incorporated an element of collective expenditure. In addition to providing support for hospitals located in the communities in which they traded, societies also offered financial aid to nationally recognised charities. In this way financial assistance and support provided through the co-operative business model was not solely focused on extending the purchasing power of individual consumers. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

It is increasingly being recognized that commercialization of surplus output from small scale farming is closely linked to higher productivity, greater specialization and higher income. From the six selected societies in each district, 75 households were randomly selected having representation from member and non-member categories on proportionate basis.

    abstract = {A key activity in Phase 1 of REDD+-the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) forestry mitigation mechanism-is the development of policies and measures (PAMs) to define where and how emissions reductions and carbon stock enhancements and conservation will be achieved. This paper provides contextual data and information for the development of PAMs specifically for the buffer zones of protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon, sites where REDD+ has the potential to generate considerable social and ecological co-benefits. The study sites are the buffer zones of two national parks, Yanachaga-Chemillen (YChNP) in central Peru and Manu (MNP) in the south-east. Data were collected through smallholder household surveys (n = 200), covering livelihood strategies, land use practices and preference rankings of five REDD+ criteria. The findings suggest that PAMs in buffer zones could realistically achieve an additional ~10 % conservation of remaining forest and between 25 and 70 % additional reforestation of non-forest areas on private lands. The paper argues that in areas where agricultural co-operatives exist, such as MNP, these should be engaged in national REDD+ PAMs and supported by an international NGO; in areas where smallholders operate individually, such as YChNP, international NGOs may be best placed to gain local trust and thereby raise participation rates. The environmental effectiveness of REDD+ conservation PAMs could be greater in areas of intense agricultural production, yet financial and technical support for reforestation may offer the most effective avenue for carbon mitigation in these areas. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In the case of credit cooperatives, the new economic and regulatory environment has resulted in numerous mergers and cooperative group membership as a way to ensure their survival. That is why the aim of this paper is to provide a preventive tool that allows the analysis of the survival of these entities.

Thus, the study aims to identify some strategic enabling cooperatives to increase its revenue and result. Through simulations, the study also shows the effects on income if the suggested strategies are implemented and projections prove accurate. The relevance of this study is justified by the growing importance of costs in decision-making organizations, as well as the difficulty that shops belonging to cooperatives face to increase its turnover due to the restriction of the market. The methodology used in this project is the case study, considering the processes related to a cooperative, showing variable costs, contribution margin and market potential. The results of the study, it appears that the cooperative can increase by 64% its sales to farmers cooperatives that supply milk, if kept the relationship shown between the cooperative and ten associates evaluated. Based on simulations, considering projections of changes in price and variations of quantities sold, the cooperative can achieve an increase of 16.02% in revenue and an increase of 30.47% in the total contribution margin.},

According to the results, the pure-strategy location equilibrium in both cases involves a distance between the two players larger or equal to 1/4. Nevertheless, the equilibriums are qualitatively different. In the pure duopsony, a large distance is required to prevent a price war while in the mixed duopsony, the private firm tries to stay away from the co-op in order to ensure a strictly positive profit.},

    abstract = {In 2005, shortly after the Venezuelan government declared 'twenty-first-century socialism' as its development goal, Chávez launched 'social production companies' to change the way communities produced and exchanged goods. Investigation of the relationship between these companies, agrarian cooperatives, and the oil economy calls into question assessments by both the right and the left, the former portraying Venezuelan development initiatives as populist profligacy and the latter seeing them as a socialist alternative to neoliberal hegemony. An analytical focus upon ground rent and the way it is distributed through the social production companies that draws upon insights from the Marxian critique of political economy provides an original window onto the contradictions and limits of the Chávez government's development policies. Three case studies suggest that social production companies and their links with small agrarian cooperatives are reproducing a limited and ground-rent-dependent form of capital accumulation that, coupled with the ideology of popular power, is being presented as a step toward twentyfirst- century socialism. En 2005, poco después de que el gobierno venezolano declarara el 'socialismo del siglo veintiuno' como su objetivo de desarrollo, Chávez lanzó las 'empresas de producción social' para cambiar la forma en que las comunidades producían e intercambiaban bienes. Una investigación de la relación entre estas empresas, las cooperativas agrarias, y la economía petrolera pone en tela de juicio las evaluaciones tanto de la derecha como la izquierda, la primera representando las iniciativas del desarrollo venezolano como derroche populista y la segunda viéndolas como la alternativa socialista a la hegemonía neoliberal. Un enfoque analítico sobre la renta de la tierra y su distribución por medio de las empresas de producción social que se fundamenta en la critica marxiana de la economía política ofrece una ventana original hacia las contradicciones y límites de la política de desarrollo chavista. Tres estudios de caso sugieren que las empresas de producción social y sus vínculos con pequeñas cooperativas agrícolas están reproduciendo una forma de acumulación de capital limitada y dependiente de la renta de la tierra, la cual, junta con la ideología de poder popular, se está presentando como un paso hacia el socialismo del siglo veintiuno. © 2013 Latin American Perspectives.},

    abstract = {A topic of recent interest in the retail financial sector has been the growth of credit unions or "pure cooperatives". Past credit union researchers built mathematical models of credit union operations. These models identified important operating characteristics but were modeled under assumptions of static operating environments. The model presented in this paper departs from the traditional static models and examines dynamic operation for a United States credit union. Its inter-temporal structure clarifies a number of issues-such as optimal equity retention and inter-temporal rate policy-not addressed by earlier studies. Given initial conditions, the model specifies equity retention and inter-temporal deposit and loan rate policies until an equilibrium state is reached. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The comparative analysis shows the relevance of the social and cultural contexts in shaping the mechanisms of governance, as well contributing to the policy debate in the European Union regarding new food quality schemes.},

The article also assesses the participation of agribusiness cooperatives in the production of items included in the model and the possible influences this type of organization could exert on changes addressed to economical efficiency. Through questionnaires and interviews with cooperative managers, it was possible to assess the cooperative willingness to motivate changes on their production and their member portfolios. It was also possible to verify that the main reasons influencing decisions on production preference changes are related to economical and rational aspects, such as cooperative strategic focus and member resistance. Reasons related to political or social aspects are inherent to the cooperative organizational characteristics, however, in the Paraná's context these reasons do not exert significant influence on diversification decisions considered as market risk management tools.},

The core of this strategy is the orientation on the region, local and regional food and food products and the co-operation with local small and medium suppliers. Another part of this strategy is also the permanent control of quality of these products and creation of the special private label - Quality food from our region. The consumer co-operative co-operates also with the regional grouping under another label - Tastes great. Southbohemian. The assessment is done by means of the analysis of a questionnaire survey that was done among consumers in the South Bohemia in 2011. The strongest factor differentiating customers of the retail chain TERNO from other consumer is the orientation on regional or local products, which explains about 41% of variability. Other differentiating factors are environment-friendly production and selling and quality of food. All these three factors explain in total 66.5% of variability of the data set.},

Options that are analyzed include growth and restructuring, dividend allocation, member entry and exit, and member embedded value options. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical estimates of the options’ financial value, as well as sensitivity analyses, are presented for a stylized example using historical data and Monte Carlo option-pricing methods. Attention is paid to the effect of member age, discount rate and business operation size. Findings – Results suggest that the board’s growth options can be substantial, while member options generally have small but nontrivial value. Implications for the stability of membership are drawn. Practical implications – The financial or economic value of strategic options in agricultural cooperatives can be significant, and decision makers may benefit from accounting for their presence. Originality/value – Cooperatives play an important role in agribusiness but have undergone significant changes in the past two decades in terms of organizational and financial structure. This paper contributes to an understanding of the value of control and residual rights associated with the Board and members of cooperatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Data for this study were collected from a random sample of 360 farming households in Ekiti and Osun States. Descriptive analysis of data on respondents' socioeconomic characteristics showed that the farmers are aging (average age is 55 years) with only about one-third (34.7 per cent) having tertiary education. Respondents' distribution by services conducted on their mobile phones indicated transfer of recharge cards which are later converted into cash as the most patronized. Important correlates of mobile phones usage as mobile banks include age, years of formal education, membership of cooperative societies, household size and access to power (electricity). © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

In developed economies, such as the USA and Canada, these organizations, aligned with the theoretical proposition, adopt governance models that promote the separation of ownership and decision rights. However, in Brazil, despite the lack ofquantitative studies that measure governance separation, anecdotal evidence suggests that ownership and decisions rights are concentrated in Brazilian cooperatives. By means of a survey with 77 Brazilian agricultural cooperatives, this paper measures the degree of de jure and de facto separation of ownership and decision control, providing new evidences on the governance models observed in different countries. Different models coexist in Brazil, i.e., although the majority of agricultural cooperatives concentrate ownership and decision rights, a significant proportion organize themselves consistently with the theoretical proposition, adopting the American models of agricultural cooperatives. Further research is required in order to address the determinants of the variety of governance models in Brazil.},

    abstract = {The relative efficiency of producer co-operatives is investigated through an examination of the financial performance of a group of cotton spinning firms that emerged from the spread of co-operative ideals after the mid-nineteenth century. Reflecting such influences these firms adopted two particularly important aspects of democratic governance: use of low denomination partly paid shares to encourage wide share ownership among local working class operatives, and the use of a one shareholder one vote rule at company meetings. Prior literature, much of which predicts the failure of producer co-operatives due to incentive problems, has not specifically examined these aspects of democratic control. Moreover because the case study utilises samples of stock market quoted companies, there is an opportunity to quantify the financial performance effects of these governance mechanisms. The case study therefore offers a unique insight and important contribution to the wider literature. The results show that both aspects of democratic governance contributed to the economic success of the companies that adopted them, enabling them to satisfy the high demand for cash dividends that characterised investor requirements. However, the cyclical nature of the cotton industry and the stock market booms and slumps that resulted led to redistributions of wealth through time that in the long run undermined the co-operative project. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {Balh Valley in the northwestern Himalayas in India is well known for cultivation of high-value cash crops and vegetables. The Indo-German Agricultural Project executed four decades ago in the valley has been the driving force for agrarian development in the valley, but crops are still grown under nutrient-starved conditions, giving low productivity compared to national averages. To demonstrate and disseminate the integrated nutrient management (INM) technology in the irrigated ecosystem of Balh Valley, efforts were funded by the Indian Farmers' Fertilizers Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) to develop sustainable crop production systems under cash crops and vegetables following an appropriate technology transfer model by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Sundernagar, India. For effective technology transfer, field demonstrations, method demonstrations, farmers' training camps, field days, and numerous field conventions were organized in addition to extending soil testing, literature supply, promotional seed and fertilizer input supply, and training of agro-cooperative society personnel who deal with seed and fertilizer input supply in the region. The greater extension gaps in tomato-blackgram and potato-Kharif onion crop sequences indicated need for effective technology transfer tools for high adoption of technology in these production systems in the valley. Potato-Kharif onion cropping system using INM technology resulted in greater system productivity in terms of blackgram equivalent yield (76.7q ha-1) and gross (3,06,920 ha-1) and net returns (2,22,295 ha-1), followed by tomato-blackgram and green pea-okra production systems, respectively, using an appropriate technology transfer model. The study also revealed improvement in available nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P)-potassium (K) and organic carbon (C) pool of the soils besides crop productivity and profitability in field trials under INM practices over farmers' practiced plots. Knowledge before the study about soil testing, dose and time of application of organics, chemical fertilizers, and their integrated use ranged from 9 to 41%, whereas knowledge increases after the study ranged between 55 to 88%. The INM technology adoption rate after 1 year of project completion ranged between 66 to 70%, whereas soil testing was done by only 35% of farmers. Thus, INM technology adoption rate was greater following the appropriate technology transfer model based on critical analyses of fertilizer use, existing production systems, and appropriate interventions for technology transfer. This comprehensive study under the IFFCO-KVK Collaborative Project attempts to highlight that an effective technology transfer model can play a key role in adoption of INM technology for sustainable production systems in the developing world, especially for resource- and knowledge-poor farmers of collateral socioagroeconomic environments of developing nations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {This paper investigates whether long-tenured cooperative chief executive officers (CEOs) are successful in negotiating less monitoring, resulting in the cooperative being agent driven. Utilizing a sample of the 1000 largest US agricultural cooperatives, we examine whether boards of long-tenured CEOs exhibit differences in composition, formal committees, or procedures that may indicate these boards are more lenient monitors. We find long-tenured CEOs experience less board monitoring. This result is primarily due to a difference in procedural mechanisms, rather than board composition. However, it is unclear whether monitoring leniency is an indication of the CEO's ability to negotiate less monitoring. It remains a possibility that CEOs with shorter tenures also influence the board; but their recommendations may be heavily influenced by non-compulsory conformance with stricter corporate governance regulations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This paper reconsiders these problems from the perspective of heterodox institutionalist economics in the tradition of Veblen and Ayres. The property rights problems of agricultural cooperatives seemingly reinforce the new institutional economics presumption of the superiority of fully delineated private ownership. In contrast, the paper shows these problems to be likewise consistent with the heterodox institutionalist school, which is much more reserved about the societal role of private ownership. Toward this end, the paper elaborates the logical structure of the so-called "institutionalist dichotomy". The property rights problems of agricultural cooperatives are explained as a particular manifestation of this dichotomy.},

However, customers who are unaware of their behavioral biases may fail to recognize this advantage of non-investor-owned firms. We present evidence from the consumer financial services market that supports our theory. Comparing contract terms, we find that mutually owned firms offer lower penalties, such as default interest rates, and higher up-front prices, such as introductory interest rates, than do investor-owned firms. However, consumers most vulnerable to these penalties are no more likely to use mutually owned firms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Local (independent) traders still constitute a major market for coffee producers. Yet, cooperatives also accept the produce from non-members and pay them the same price. Our objective in this paper is to analyse the importance of this phenomenon of double side-selling. We collected data from a sample of 170 coffee farmers. We use a probit model to analyse characteristics linked to cooperative membership and to study double side-selling. We describe the trade relationships between farmers and the cooperative on the one hand, and between farmers and traders on the other by the attributes of transaction costs involved in the trade of coffee. Membership characteristics include easy access to labour, land tenure, risk aversion, and mutual trust between farmers and cooperatives' management. Preference to sell to traders can be explained by the trust farmers seem to have in them after the repeated transactions in credit and basic consumption items and by long-term relationships in the community. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

From the 1970s the town's inhabitants had enjoyed a secure livelihood and relative prosperity. The collapse of the socialist economy resulted in mass unemployment. The privatisation and the transformation of the structure of ownership were experienced in a positive way by only a few, the majority of the town's inhabitants have been living in existential crisis for two decades now. A high percentage, close to 50% of those of active age, live on social benefits. The fewer than half a dozen medium-sized enterprises that strengthened after the turn of the millennium, and agriculture - which is characterised by a strong concentration of land-holding - are able to employ only a small proportion of the population. The majority of the town's inhabitants are characterised by "invisible impoverishment" and struggle against loss of status. The lack of prospects leads to the out-migration of young people with qualifications. It is projected that fifteen to twenty years from now the town's population will be made up of the inactive with low qualifications and the elderly. The economy, society, demography and health care all show an unfavourable picture. Anomie has become a permanent state. Comparative analysis of the economic and social indicators shows that Túrkeve can be described as an "average" settlement in Hungary today.},

In Ibaragi Prefecture north of Tokyo, the agricultural cooperatives that provide inputs to farmers and market their vegetables and other produce helped their farmer-members introduce foreign trainees, who allowed farmers to expand their production and increased cooperative sales. Trainees must be paid the Japanese mini-mum wage for most of the 36 months they are in Japan with the additional costs for train-related system, but they are still cheaper than full-time Japanese farm workers.

A theoretical model is presented which explains how the competitive effect may work in this particular setting, where cooperative membership implies certain costs that are perceived differently by different producers.

As employees are key stakeholders, they play a vital part in achieving organizational goals. This study, a work in progress, highlights an in-depth, qualitative analysis of two organizations-one in Canada and one in Australia-committed to funding community projects as part of their corporate social responsibility development and commitment. The importance of a qualitative study that focuses on subjective components of social capital is that it develops understanding of employees' attitudes, feelings, and viewpoints. It also begins to investigate why employees might/might not be committed, to organizations' social capital initiatives. Using an interpretative analysis lens, an understanding of the moral, relational, and communication dynamics is explored. Questions surrounding concepts such as the moral fiber of social capital are highlighted and critiqued in the context of community engagement and what organizations' social capital investments mean as part of their responsibility to society. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities. To conclude, we discuss the advantages and challenges of politicizing cooperatives and offer reflections on how these challenges might be overcome.},

We call this system the Integrated General Model (IGM) and it allows users to control the breeding schemes and selection methods by manipulating the input parameters. The Current Hanwoo Performance and Progeny Test (CHPPT) scheme was simulated with a Modified Hanwoo Performance and Progeny Test (MHPPT) scheme using a Hanwoo Breeding Farm cow population of the Livestock Improvement Main Center (LOMC) of the National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation (NACF). To compare the two schemes, a new method, the Simple Hanwoo Performance Test (SHPT), which uses ultrasound technology for measuring the carcass traits of live animals, was developed. These three models, including the CHPPT, incorporated three types of selection criteria: phenotype (PH), true breeding value (TBV), and estimated breeding value (EBV). The simulation was scheduled to mimic an actual Hanwoo breeding program; thus, the simulation was run to include the years 1983-2020 for each breeding method and was replicated 10 times. The parameters for simulation were derived from the literature. Approximately 642,000 animals were simulated per replication for the CHPPT scheme; 129,000 animals were simulated for the MHPPT scheme and 112,000 animals for the SHPT scheme. Throughout the 38-year simulation, all estimated parameters of each simulated population, regardless of population size, showed results similar to the input parameters. The deviations between input and output values for the parameters in the large populations were statistically acceptable. In this study, we integrated three simulated models, including the CHPPT, in an attempt to achieve the greatest genetic gains within major economic traits including body weight at 12 months of age (BW12), body weight at 24 months of age (BW24), average daily gain from 6 to 12 months (ADG), carcass weight (CWT), carcass longissimus muscle area (CLMA), carcass marbling score (CMS), ultrasound scanned longissimus muscle area (ULMA), and ultrasound scanned marbling score (UMS).},

Individual incentives are not aligned with group gains in cooperatives because individual members bear the costs of offering higher qualities, whereas the benefits from these higher qualities are shared among all members. We present a blind mechanism whose quality-enhancing properties are analyzed in a theoretical model. This mechanism, which does not require individual monitoring, consists of individually punishing co-op members by using aggregate co-op performance in such way that the better the co-op quality, the lower the exclusion probability. In a computerized environment, using experimental methods, we specifically test the effectiveness of our mechanism in alleviating the incentive problem. Experimental results show that our blind punishment mechanism achieves significant efficiency gains. © The Author(s) 2010.

Using the theory of collective action as an analytical framework the paper examined findings from in-depth interviews with 20 members of two co-operative initiatives in Wales and two participatory workshops. Consideration of the theory helped in understanding how individuals come together to provide public goods, and the conditions that make this activity a success. Factors of importance for organising and delivering collective agrienvironment schemes were: locally adaptable engagement strategies; working with group members previously known to each other; institutional arrangements that limited group size and which allowed groups to develop their own solutions and implementation rules; and external support offering the services of a local facilitator and funding for both planning and management stages. A clear finding from the research was the extent to which both business and social confidence can grow within such groups which opens up further development opportunities. The paper identifies key factors that could be used to encourage and enhance the success of co-operative groups in delivering landscape-scale agri-environment schemes. The research findings identify appropriate mechanisms for the design and delivery of collective agri-environment schemes and environment management in the UK, which can also be applied to other parts of Europe. © 2011 Wageningen University.},

Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint identified by years of experience dealing with co-operative organisations. Findings: The paper finds that the basis of development of corporate social responsibility from the perspective of commercial corporations does not promote an adequate accounting framework for co-operative enterprises and member-owned businesses. Research limitations/implications: Practitioners in different areas of business are trying to make sense of sustainability accounting and reporting in a commercial setting. This piece by one of these, draws on a topical initiative around co-operative enterprises to raise questions around what is meant by performance in the context of member-owned enterprises and whether the field of corporate social responsibility has overlooked the relevance of ownership in terms of organisational incentives for action. Practical implications: The author proposes a series of definitions for co-operative performance, which are designed to underpin metrics that relate to "member value". This is offered in contrast to "shareholder value" for companies that, unlike co-operatives, are owned by external shareholders. Social implications: The field of corporate social responsibility is a major user and innovator of the tools and techniques for sustainability accounting and reporting. But it tends to be silent on ownership. However, if different models of ownership create different incentives for action on sustainable development, then rather than just accounting for "how" an enterprise operates, however it is owned and led, there may be value in tools to test "whether" an institution is fit for purpose in its fundamental design. Originality/value: The paper develops a new perspective and future research opportunities in identifying performance measures for co-operative enterprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, in vertebrates, cooperation often occurs between non-relatives and promiscuity rates are among the highest recorded. Here we resolve this apparent inconsistency with a phylogenetic analysis of 267 bird species, demonstrating that cooperative breeding is associated with low promiscuity; that in cooperative species, helping is more common when promiscuity is low; and that intermediate levels of promiscuity favour kin discrimination. Overall, these results suggest that promiscuity is a unifying feature across taxa in explaining transitions to and from cooperative societies. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

    abstract = {Farming cooperative credit sections are financial instruments set up within a cooperative and at its service. They are key funding tools in rural areas and have been developed all over Spain although more intensely in some areas than others. The aim of this paper is to carry out a strategic diagnosis of the Spanish credit section using a SWOT Analysis to discover its set of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, as well as a proposal for strategic actions to be followed. In order to do so an empirical study using personalized surveys and interviews has been undertaken among the managers or persons in charge of the credit sections over the first half of 2008. The study demonstrates that they are efficient entities for their clients (cooperative members). Their main strengths are focussed on their clients, although they show significant weaknesses in organizational, business and technological capacities, which require an effort to provide them with more professional management. Legal constraints are the main threat at present, although uncertainty in the agricultural sector affects their survival. © 2011 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2011 CIRIEC.},

The research is a case study, in which the average values were used, paid and received for the month of January 2009. The data collection instruments used were a literature review, desk review of company documents, on-site observation and interviews with company managers. The results show that all stages of the value chain realize profits from the producer to the distributor, and the smaller portion was for the producer and the largest in the industry. It is concluded that the manufacturing industry contributed the largest share of final consumer price. It cost elements are the most representative raw material and transport (production costs), as well as in the case of long life UHT milk, the packaging, which accounts for 19% of the amount paid by the consumer. Moreover, it is suggested that the role of key players - producers' cooperatives, manufacturers and distributors - and the impact of their logistics costs in the final price targets of future studies.},

While the smallest rural savings banks continue their policy of support for the agrarian cooperatives and their partners, the larger ones are getting out of agrarian cooperativism.},

The gain is net of the costs of cooperative participation but not of other costs incurred to become certified and suggests that price premiums alone have a limited potential to increase household returns from growing coffee. More broadly speaking, the finding raises questions about the persistence of substantial price premiums associated with social or environmental labeling initiatives. © 2011.},

Also, they do not have any specific risk business control, or risk management is not yet worked out with emphasis by agricultural cooperatives. Already, analyzing cost management, there is a more active stance. It was found that cooperatives employ cost controls, methods of costing and management controls that help into the decision making process.

    abstract = {In Turkey, the Wholesale Markets Law was enacted in 1995 to facilitate small-scale growers' access to the fresh produce market. Cooperatives and commission agents have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question the advantages and disadvantages that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of small-scale farmers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the management and economic success of beef production by three types of farm in northwestern Vietnam. The potential of household farms to supply beef for the market and their competition with large farms were examined. The fieldwork was done in 2007 on 73 farms consisting of 58 small mixed farms (small farms), 10 medium mixed farms (medium farms) and 5 specialised large-scale beef farms (large farms) in Son La province. The three types of farm differed in ethnicity (Thai, H'mong, and Kinh), remoteness (lowland, highland), production objectives (subsistence, market output), degree of specialization (mixed farm, specialised beef farm) and integration of production (single farmers, cooperative). Data on biological productivity, inputs and outputs, and the social contribution of cattle production were collected by household and key person interviews, participatory rural appraisal tools and cattle body measurements. Economic values were derived by assessment of market or replacement costs. Quantitative data analysis was done with linear models (PROC GLM) in the SAS software (version 9.1). Lowland small farms had higher costs for cattle production than the highland farms (0.8 Mill. VND head-1 year-1 compared with 0.02 Mill. VND head-1 year-1, respectively). The large farms had high production costs, with an average of 2.5-3.6 Mill. VND head-1 year-1. Cattle brought high benefits of non-cash values to the household farms. The total revenue from cattle was in the range 4.5-11.5 Mill. VND head-1 year-1, which depended on the use of non-market functions of cattle on the household farm. The value of net benefit/kg live weight (LW) of lowland small farms with an average of 39,000 VND/kg LW was significantly higher than that of the medium and small farms in the highlands (26,000 VND/kg LW). However, the small farms kept fewer cattle than the medium farms (average of 2-4 cattle/farm compared with 9 cattle/farm, respectively) because of forage and labour shortages and have no option to further develop cattle production. Keeping larger numbers of cattle based on available natural pasture brought high benefit from stock value as farm liquidity to only the medium farms. This was the most promising type of farm for future development of beef production, given its actual success and the availability of underutilised resources. Large-scale farms suffered high economic losses of 0.3-1.4 Mill. VND cattle-1 year-1, due to the lack of professional management, high feed costs and low animal performance, and showed no potential for developing cattle production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {Territorial development involves the organized participation of social actors in decisions regarding the use of the public - and, largely, private - resources of a region. Despite the obvious democratic virtues of the participatory processes, there has been a recent increase in the critical literature, questioning their results. This paper intends to reveal the tension experienced by the contemporary social movements: the conflict between representativeness and innovation. Representa tive movements tend to consolidate and strengthen interests, and their institutionalization pushes them towards routine attitudes that often block their innovative potential. One way out of the impasses of the social movements is in the terms of management of the social participation focused explicitly on learning and innovation. Organizations coming from social movements are an essential part of the participatory processes. This article, based on the example of the Brazilian policy of strengthening family agriculture, examines two of those organizations whose origin is in the social movements: the Federação dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura Familiar - FETRAF (Federation of Workers in Family Farming), which is a trade union; and the CRESOL System of cooperatives for credit outreach. Both organizations stimulate participatory processes and are associated with government policies. In the case of the trade union, however, social participation does not result in innovation, and the ties with the government tend to restrict the movement to relations already known. As regards the credit cooperative, social participation and ties with the government are the result of incentives that encourage the strengthening of what the new economic sociology calls weak ties, and thus open the way to expand the very foundations of the processes of local development.},

This approach is applied to a database of 163 farms located in the Campos County, a region belonging to the dry lands of the Spanish Northern Plateau, using 12 individual indicators of sustainability. Our findings show that both economic and environmental composite sustainability indicators are positively correlated, but that this is not the case for the social indicator. We also check the influence of a set of variables on farm sustainability using bootstrapping statistical techniques, and showing that increasing farm size, membership in agricultural cooperatives and farmers' medium and upper agricultural-specific technical education, all exert a significant positive influence on sustainability.

Amalsad Co-operative works in a highly competitive market. There are more than 15 private traders in the Amalsad market. But the co-operative accounts for 60% of the total market arrivals of fruits. With a paid up capital of Rs. 9.16 lakh and reserve funds of the order of Rs. 5.53 crore, the Amalsad Co-operative shows a robust financial performance. The cooperative made a profit of Rs. 46.89 lakh in 2006-07. Besides, the co-operative owns a petrol pump and a cloth store at Amalsad, though there is also a departmental store in the compound of the co-operative. The farmer members are given advance credit and many other input and consumption loans and facilities for the crop. Co-operatives were the main channel used to sell chickoo than regulated market. Highest price was received by farmer members of co-operative society during the corresponding year as compared by APMC and pre-harvest contractor. The main reason for the selection of cooperatives as marketing channel was higher price payment, the quality based and timely payment. Amalsad Co-operative Society had got two awards for the year 2006-07 i. e. National Productivity Award, 2006 and NCDC Award, 2006. Amalsad Co-operative is able to provide a sustainable solution to the marketing problems in horticulture as it is professionally organized and managed under the able supervision and direction of share holders.many ways, Amalsad Co-operatives come close to the New Generation Co-operatives. Due to their better marketing abilities, they have been able to gain member loyalty as well as overcome capital constraint which so often is a major problem for co-operative organizations. The role of Amalsad Co-operative is not only to develop the society but also increase the economic condition of the farmers.},

    abstract = {With this paper we aim to analyse how new entrepreneurial strategies are emerging in the field of agricultural cooperatives within the Region of Valencia (Spain), and how these strategies are characterised through the lens of the agrarian-based rural development model. Initial results show that these strategies have the potential to strengthen the role of cooperatives in rural economic development as they add value to specific territorial resources, create new ties with other local and nonlocal actors, and diversify the economy of rural areas. Nevertheless, the cooperative (collective) nature of these organisations can also create decision-making and investment problems, as they can divide the interests of their social base. © 2010 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.},

Data were obtained from 240 respondents including 120 mandarin fish farmers and 120 clown fish farmers, which were randomly selected from villages in the study area by means of structured and semi-structured questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and stochastic frontier function that incorporated inefficiency effects that were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE). The result showed that the sum of elasticity for mandarin fish and clown fish were found to be 1.36 and 1.25, respectively implies that both production systems were operated in inefficient stage (technically inefficient). The result also showed that fish farmers' educational level, accessto credit, farm size and feed positively influenced their levels of efficiency in mandarin fish and clown fish production systems in Cross River State. Extension agents should guide fish farmers on levels of inputs combination that would ensure efficient production of fish. Regular awareness campaign about new technologies in fish production should be embarked on by extension agents; this will enable fish farmers adopt new technologies in fish production. Extension agents should train fish farmers on improved production technique while banks should give loans to fish farmers and strictly monitor all her loan beneficiaries to ensure loan repayment. The study also recommends efficient policy formulation and implementation that will encourage fish farmers and unemployed youth in Cross River State to join fish producers cooperative(s) to enable them obtain loans at low interest rate from banks for increase in their capital base for higher output.},

    abstract = {Credit unions are non-profit financial organisations that provide financial services to their members. They are located in 97 countries across the world. All credit unions are governed by a volunteer board and many are reliant on volunteers for all their labour requirements. However, recruiting volunteers is a problem. The literature on recruitment issues in volunteering in general, suggests that the not-for-profit sector looks to the private sector for guidance on recruitment policies and approaches. One such approach which is considered in this paper is ‘market segmentation’ wherein the potential volunteer body is profiled to determine if an individual is likely to volunteer and if they are, to identify the type of role they are most likely to be attracted to. Prior literature on volunteering in non-profit organisations suggests that certain types of individual (dominant individuals) are more likely to volunteer. This paper investigates whether this dominant status profile is evident amongst volunteers in credit unions in Northern Ireland (NI). The study finds that people with dominant characteristics are more likely to be attracted to volunteering to the board of directors and individuals who have less dominant traits overall should be offered more social/participative type roles. This information can be used by credit union governing boards for volunteer recruitment, retention and management purposes. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

    abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the meaning and content of the term “orderly marketing” as it was adopted by Western Canadian farm leaders in the 1920s, and to determine whether the expected results of “orderly marketing”, as they were enunciated by farm leaders, were met. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the critique that farm leaders and Wheat Pool officials levelled against the open market, and the way they posited “orderly marketing” as a solution to their perceived problems. Using contemporary data on wheat prices and movements, it analyzes the content of orderly marketing, and the results of its implementation by the Pools. Findings – The paper finds that “orderly marketing” was primarily a campaign slogan, that the problems it was alleged to address did not exist, and that its implementation by the Wheat Pools did not yield the results that the farm leaders had promised. The paper acknowledges however, the significant accomplishments of these organizations, and postulates that the concept of orderly marketing resonates with aspects of Canadian culture and helps to explain why grain marketing in the USA and Canada evolved so differently. Originality/value – The agricultural cooperative movement in Western Canada has been the subject of a great deal of historical research, most of it positive. However, there are no recently published qualitative studies of the history of the term, nor in-depth quantitative analyses of the economic results achieved by the Wheat Pools during the 1920s that compare with the contents of this paper. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose: In this paper, the key drivers and constraints for implementing traceability are examined in the Greek fresh produce supply chain. The main objective is to identify the main factors affecting the implementation of traceability schemes, under the current supply chain structure and evaluate the theoretical framework identified in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A specific executive research was conducted, including interviews with key representatives of the sector. The scope of the research was to collect qualitative data with the aid of an unstructured questionnaire with no close-ended questions. The research sample included 22 agricultural cooperatives and private packinghouses located in northern Greece where the core value adding activities of the fresh produce supply chain are taking place. Northern Greece is of high importance for the examined sector as a high percentage of all value adding activities, from production to distribution, are taking place within this region. Findings: In the fresh produce supply chains ephemeral dynamic collaborations prevail which do not allow particular transparency with regard to the exchange of information between their members. Severe inequities recognized between supply chain members regarding their ability to imply traceability systems effectively, their current technological and operational status and the availability to undertake the cost of investment in such systems. Tight profit margins and inadequate knowledge on potential benefits of traceability systems are reported as some of the main factors that hinder investments on sophisticated traceability schemes. Adequate labeling automation with the implementation of machine-readable labeling technologies and the introduction of web-based technologies as a low cost solution are estimated to improve fresh produce traceability and logistics efficiency. Originality/value: Within a limited number of research papers on fresh produce traceability, there is no reference to the Greek produce sector. Thus, this paper progresses knowledge of the Greek produce industry regarding perspectives and key drivers for traceability implementation, supported by the thorough review of the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Data were obtained through: 1) questionnaires to a large group of cooperatives, 2) focus groups with a smaller number of cooperatives, and 3) personal interviews with union of cooperatives representatives. The findings indicate that the unions of cooperatives are working on issues such as registering and auditing cooperatives and resolving land ownership conflicts. The cooperatives also need help in business management, marketing, legal services, and organizational effectiveness. The unions will not be able to help in these areas so nongovernmental organizations will need to provide these educational programming for farmers.},

Based on a national representative survey of 157 FPCs in China, this study shows that 32% of FPCs introduced written contracts in the primary marketing channel. Contracts are more likely to be adopted in the livestock sector and are positively related to the scale of production. While branding promotes contracts between FPCs and buyers, public certification of quality and food safety often substitutes for contracts. Furthermore, the membership heterogeneity of FPCs affects an FPC's decision to use contractual arrangements with the buyer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Purpose - As a major agricultural province in central China, Hubei Province mainly carries out the peasant household credit investigation system through rural credit cooperatives (RCCs). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the peasant household credit investigation system in Hubei RCCs and provide some evidence and ideas to the formulation of relevant policies. Design/methodology/approach - First, this paper briefly reviews the related literature of the efficiency in credit investigation system; second, the paper gives a brief description of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and designs the indicators for efficiency evaluation; third, the paper accounts data sources and processing methods; and finally, the paper performs the empirical analysis and draws a conclusion. Findings - The paper finds that the efficiency of the resource allocation in both regions is unoptimistic, the general efficiency is somewhat low, and it shows the trend of declination. The efficiency of pure technology in two regions represents the adverse trend. Every year's average scale efficiency in both regions is higher than the pure technology efficiency. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper include the first use of DEA model to practically evaluate the efficiency of credit investigation system based on 54 samples of RCCs in Hubei Province and the horizontal and vertical comparisons of the results. The conclusions of this paper not only make the efficiency of credit investigation system in the province's 54 credit cooperatives comparable but also has a great application value to the actual decision-making departments in formulating credit policies, and each credit cooperative in further building the credit investigation system according to its own conditions. Moreover, it has certain reference value to other similar studies. Copyright © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

Aflatoxins were also detected and varied at the levels of 2.45-3.43 ng per g unhulled rice grain and 1.29-2.09 ng per g white rice grain. Unhulled rice generally detected higher level of aflatoxins than white rice regardless of sampling regions; however, no significant differences were found in Anseong and Cheonan in 2005 and Cheonan and Gimpo in 2007. Aflatoxin production between sampling regions was not different regardless of rice type and sampling year. Although the fungal diversity was highly distinct from region to region, three Aspergillus isolates were predominant in the rice samples; thus, representative isolates AC317, AF57, and AF8 were selected and identified based on their morphological and molecular characteristics. Consequently, isolates AC317, AF57, and AF8 were identified as A. candidus, A flavus, and A. fumigatus, respectively. These fungi can produce mycotoxins that are harmful for consumers and thus it is important to detect and reduce the population of storage fungi in rice. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.},

In both cases, the emphasis has been on the know-how and leadership of the local agents, which are seen as "subjects of their own development," rather than "objects of study." The study reveals the limits and the power of a cooperative; even if it is separated by a considerable distance from the centers of distribution, and suffers from high operating costs, arid lands and infrastructure problems. These cases are particularly important to reinforce the importance of the cooperatives, especially in areas considered disadvantaged.},

    abstract = {This study investigates the role that local fruit varieties can play in achieving the dual objectives of food sovereignty and income generation in the Tajik Pamir Mountains. In this very harsh environment, agriculture is characterized by a great diversity of fruit varieties central to local food culture and household security. Local fruit trees can grow in poor soils on slopes and their resistance to diseases, cold, and ultraviolet light give them marked advantages over introduced varieties. However, the humanitarian crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union and recent efforts by development organizations to create markets by introducing exotic varieties are negatively affecting agricultural biodiversity (agrobiodiversity) and, potentially, household security. A study was carried out in 3 districts of the Gorno-Badakhshan province to investigate the household consumption and market potential of products derived from local varieties of apple, apricot, and mulberry and how these products could be better exploited to benefit community livelihoods and agrobiodiversity conservation. Results show that fruit represents the farmers' main source of food and income. Many local varieties are maintained for a variety of reasons related to household consumption, whereas the main reason for cultivating introduced varieties is income generation. Great care must therefore be taken in planning market strategies: a pure market focus will almost certainly endanger household security, whereas a strategy linking income generation through the commercialization of crop varieties to the promotion of qualities central to household needs will improve diversity and public health. The opportunities identified to help enhance the market potential of local fruits and maintain the Pamir's unique biocultural heritage include efforts to raise public awareness among producers and consumers of the nutritional and medicinal properties of local varieties; training for pest management, processing, and packaging; and the establishment of farmers' cooperatives. © 2011 International Mountain Society.},

    abstract = {The Mexican coffee crisis that began with the liberalization of the international coffee market in 1989 led to the reorganization of the coffee sector under the control of transnational companies after state regulation has been replaced by policies aimed at allowing the survival of the small producers but not reactivating the sector. The resistance of the powerful roaster industry, dominated by the giant Nestlé, has made it impossible to improve the quality of the coffee sold on the domestic market, and its importation of cheap robusta coffee for use in instant preparations has further reduced prices. The survival of the producer cooperatives depends on their capacity to enter the market through niches such as the organic and Fair Trade, where they receive a better price for their products. For the others, the only solution is to migrate to the North. © 2010 Latin American Perspectives.},

    abstract = {Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision. Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However, extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for instance,wedo not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies, cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.},

A comparative analysis of antitrust regulation in Israel, the European Union and the United States shows that the exemption in Israel is relatively narrow with regard to the products included but much wider with regard to the exempted firms. There are economic arguments which support exempting farmers and farmers' associations from the prohibition of restrictive arrangements to enable cooperation in production, marketing, promotion and research, but the exemption of wholesalers of agricultural products could not be justified on the grounds of economic efficiency.},

Thus, it was necessary to analyze how the agricultural cooperatives of Rio Grande do Sul measure the financial risk, checking on the background the perception of doctrinal principles. The research used a structured questionnaire and case studies. As results, the cooperatives can understand, in general scope, the importance of risk management. However, when asked about the degree of indebtedness, they showed mixed opinions. Therefore, it is noted that the main difficulty of this type of organization is to find, within a capitalist economy, a balance between the social and the economic aspect.},

Through successful negotiations, several actors were enlisted until a network of relations shaped up. Negotiations and networks anchored on the cooperatives and as facilitated or managed by the intermediaries (mainly the NIZ Management Staff and field technicians from the PCC), have resulted in integrative agreements regarding adoption of particular innovations, marketing strategies, and policy implementation. Continuous improvement and sustainability of the NIZ Program depends on the effective management of its network. Strategic alliance with other actors or private groups to help in the business aspect of the NIZ operations is also recommended.},

    abstract = {Voluntary food certification systems have emerged as a prominent mechanism of food governance in recent years. However, critics have exposed certifications' inability to secure independence, quality, consumer trust, and costs. Recent criticism is even more pointed in that some theorists have critiqued " alternative" systems such as Fair Trade as neoliberal window-dressing. What is curious about this emerging literature is how little has been said about the role of citizens. Although most of the certification literature has assumed that food certification resides in the exclusive realm of " experts" and that technical sophistication is equated with improvement, I argue that democratization is possible and desirable. This paper draws on a case study of a Japanese consumer cooperative which has conducted a laywomen's food certification system for past ten years. By proposing at least two parameters of evaluation of food certification-redistributive effect and the degree of democratization, the paper expands the imaginary of " politics of the possible" in food governance while acknowledging tension of gendered participation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Built by activists and NGOs, these systems were adopted by agribusiness. Such firms try to capture consumers and react to opinion campaigns, whilst appropriating the conservation (or 'fair') discourse. This leads to the rise of new forms of third-party certifications of food production based on private standards and, hence, to new forms of contract relations between producers and buyers. The nature of these relationships is not always evident in these new labels or in the discourse built to justify them. This is particularly so in the case of goods produced in the South to be traded and sold in the North, as the case of Starbucks illustrates. By the end of the 1990s, Starbucks, operating through an NGO called Conservation International (CI), arrived at the region of El Triunfo, in Chiapas, and contacted the producers' cooperatives that were trying to find a market for their product. CI promoted Starbucks standards to raise the coffee quality and won the control over the production system. Meanwhile, the producers forced to sell their coffee through the largest trade company (AMSA) against whom the cooperatives were created, lost the control over their own organization. When some cooperatives refused the deal, they suffered divisions but could survive thanks the Fair Trade (FT) network in Chiapas. © Springer 2010.},

This paper discusses the behavior of farmers and their cooperatives in determining the optimal share of profits in their contracts. It also illustrates the impacts of the policy changes due to the Korea's accession to the WTO on the relative negotiation power between farmers and cooperatives. The results show that the Korean rice cooperatives have more negotiation power than farmers. They set the profit share to farmers based on their own profit maximization criteria, while taking farmers supply decision into consideration. Farmers only choose how much to supply. This relationship was seen changing after 2005, when the Korean government reduced and removed the price subsidy it provided to rice cooperatives before. As the cooperatives' margin goes down without the subsidy, farmers are pushed to bargain hard for their share of the margin to maintain their revenue.},

This paper uses a survey approach to determine whether current volunteers in credit unions in Northern Ireland are more motivated by the actual act of volunteering, by the output from the volunteering activity (including altruism) or because the volunteering activity increases their human capital value. Altruistic reasons are found to be the most influential, with the act of volunteering also scoring highly. This knowledge should inform volunteer recruitment programmes and internal appraisal processes as management can reinforce messages that provide positive feedback to volunteers on the social benefits being achieved by the credit union. This will further motivate current volunteers, ensuring retention. When motivation was analyzed by volunteer characteristics we found that older volunteers, retired volunteers and volunteers who are less educated are more motivated in their role. There was little evidence that individuals volunteer to improve their human capital worth. © 2011 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2011 CIRIEC.},

The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the production potential of ethanol from Musa spp. discard and to analyze the energy and carbon (C) footprints of this production system using a life cycle approach. The study compared three case studies differing in management practices, which were (I) a coffee producer's cooperative in Costa Rica using Musa spp. as shade trees, (II) organic banana producers from Ecuador, and (III) conventional banana producers from Ecuador. It was found that banana and cooking banana discard accumulated at a rate of 1.4-3.4 t ha-1, of which around 118-266 l ethanol could be produced on a yearly basis. The case study from Costa Rica yielded a net-energy balance (NEB) of 19.3 MJ l-1 and avoided carbon emissions of 0.48 kg l-1. It was closely followed by the organic banana producers from Ecuador with a NEB of 17.1 MJ l-1 and avoided carbon emissions of 0.44 kg l-1. NEB and avoided carbon emissions for the conventional banana farms in Ecuador were much lower (7.2 MJ l-1 and 0.34 kg l-1).Despite providing economic benefits to farmers through a biomass source that would have been otherwise lost, the study gave clear evidence that the ecological footprint of this ethanol production system is significantly influenced by the resource use during the production life cycle. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although some decision support tools based mainly on linear programming and addressed to agriculture authorities were presented, their direct application by a farmer is not possible.

This paper aims to develop dynamic programming model for the long run crop plan optimization covering the typical conditions of Czech farms, which could serve as a platform for further enlargements and changes according to needs and conditions of particular farm. The dynamic programming algorithm is developed in detail for model case of four areas to be planted by four crops each year. The possibility of covering different constraints by generating the state space is discussed, and the generating procedure for crop rotation rules is shown. The goal function reflects the farmers objective of profit maximization and it is defined with respect to harvests' randomness.

    abstract = {In 1948, when the State of Israel was founded, 125,000 people (about one fifth of the Jewish population) were members of credit cooperative societies, which provided over 20 percent of all market financing. For several years this number continued to rise, reaching a total of 250,000 members in more than 100 credit cooperative societies. Credit associations - part of the thriving cooperative movement of early Zionism - symbolized the attempt to create a new and just Jewish society by fusing socialist and capitalist ideals. From the mid-1950s, however, in a rapid process of centralization of Israel's capital market and financial institutions, almost all credit associations were absorbed into Israel's commercial banks and dissolved. Today, Israel's two largest banks (Leumi and Hapoalim) control over 63 percent of credit provision, and 90 percent of credit is provided to less than 1 percent of borrowers. The official policy of the Bank of Israel is to rule out the establishment of credit associations, credit unions or other non-bank financial institutions. In the light of current renewed interest in "social businesses," i.e., innovative business models designed to achieve desired social outcomes, this Article traces the waning of credit associations in Israel, and the role law has played in that process. Their disappearance from the capital market marked not only a change in economic policy, but also the final abandonment of the ideals which underlay the provision of cooperative financial services: mutuality, partnership and solidarity.

They found empirical evidence suggesting that the analyzed prices were higher and less volatile during the period when the cooperative was in the market. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

With the objective of responding to several of the most important questions facing agriculture today, this article describes recent research in three Cuban cropping systems: state farms, cooperatives, and small family farmers. Soil management is considered here as a crux of human intervention in agroecosystems, capable of determining the impacts of productive activities upon agricultural and ecosystem functions. Management practices commonly used in each farm system are evaluated using two systems of indicators, one for technological quality and one for agricultural intensification. Soil physical quality is characterized through laboratory analysis of samples taken in the same type of soil under long-term production in state, cooperative, and family farmer cropping systems. Soil structure management in the small farmer system is especially worthy of study, because this agricultural system has developed an intensive agroecological productive model on the basis of low external input use, polycultures and internal nutrient cycling. Favorable policies and farmer organizations are discussed as indispensible elements of sustainable agricultural development. The relationships between soil management, local knowledge, and food access are explored in the Cuban context and as directions for food system studies. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The economic benefits criteria include the level of profit each enterprise type is able to generate for farmers, and the risk protection and marketing advantages each affords to farmers. The study also compared the social benefits that farmers derive from cooperatives and other agricultural organizations. Data were collected from 203 farmers, in six provinces: Tire, Odemis, Kemalpasa, Seferihisar, Foca and Urla in the Aegean region of Turkey, using face-to-face interviews. The study employed the following two different analytic hierarchy process AHP models to determine the enterprise preferences of farmers: Model 1 assessed farmer's enterprise preferences in terms of high profit, low risk and marketing advantages. Model 2 evaluated farmers' enterprise and organization preferences in terms of social benefits, human development and democratic participation. Model 1 indicates that farmers prefer cooperatives (score of 0.632) over firms and dealers. Firms and dealers were assigned preferences scores of 0.239 and 0.129, respectively. In Model 2, farmers prefer cooperatives (0.491). The chamber of farmers and extension were assigned preference scores of 0.273 and 0.236, respectively. In conclusion, farmers still have confidence in the ability of cooperatives to provide the market-related services they need and opportunities for social development and democratic expression. These results may also indicate farmers' satisfaction with their role and influence in determining cooperative governance and modus operandi. Additionally, farmers' positive attitudes and confidence in cooperatives may also be an expression of deeply held values rooted in cultural and institutional traditions of collaboration and group action at the village level over many decades.},

The newly established People's Credit Funds (PCFs) are self-managed and self-financed; yet their success is due to the central bank designing the new system, preparing its regulatory framework, providing training and supervision and enforcing prudential standards, while abstaining from undue interference. Regulation and supervision have been the state's instruments for assuring good performance, avoiding the disaster of the previous credit cooperative sector. The network overall has proved resilient during the global crisis, but with some differences between the rural PCFs and their central fund, which in addition to liquidity exchange also provides retail services in urban areas. © Practical Action Publishing, 2010.},

We compare spatial cooperative price matching with non-cooperative HotellingSmithies behaviour. Utilising a vector error correction model, we show that the observed low price transmission in Germany is in line with cooperative behaviour. This seems rational since it increases processors' profits.

We consider corporate influence in unexpected sectors, from conservation to poverty alleviation to cancer survival. Furthermore, we analyze corporate norms and practices in relation to broader governance trends, from fair-trade dynamics to shareholder activism and from corporate social responsibility initiatives to the spread of accountability measures and the impact of corporate sovereignty.

I test the effectiveness of social movement theories in explaining this phenomenon by examining frequency and intensity of protest from 1980-1995. I find that grievance models have little explanatory power, political opportunity accounts for the frequency of protest, and resource mobilization offers insight into both frequency and intensity of protests. Supplementing existing theories, I offer qualitative evidence that development programs designed to restructure agricultural cooperatives created mobilizing structures. The reforms were intended to help family farmers adapt to the new market economy, but because most protests targeted liberalization policies, I conclude that in their short-term success, development agencies inadvertently subsidized the cost of collection action against their long-term goals. © The Author 2012.

    abstract = {This paper investigates the rationale for local and sustainable food systems and retailer co-operatives as their entry points within local conditions. Emphasis is on localised food networks and connection between socially as well as environmentally sustainable production, distribution and consumption. Investigated is the premise that cooperative organisational structures, for reasons of their long-term socially responsible origins are at the forefront of development of local and sustainable food systems and are thereby in a position to offer a specific contribution to market development. Two key research questions are proposed: Firstly, is there a pre-determination of cooperatives to issues of sustainable and local food sourcing given the historical and practical context of their ethical/socially responsible and stakeholder-based business model? Secondly, do co-ops express support for re-localising food systems and what contribution do they make concerning sustainable food and their relationships with local food suppliers? The method of investigation is through a two country retailer co-operative sector analysis and comparison (Finland and Italy). The enquiry is qualitative and exploratory in nature in the form of an embedded, multiple case design. The paper makes practical and theoretical contribution to knowledge concerning interpretation of ‘localness’ in food, the role of co-operatives and the co-operative ethos in sustainable food systems and the development of the local food economy. Results of the study show a positive relationship between co-operative ethos and (social) sustainability in local food, but the de-centralised nature of retailer co-operation also provides a barrier to replication of good practice. © 2011.

Results show that in all questions related to objectives and level of satisfaction, members value them with an average of 6.9 out of 10 or higher in all cases. For both objectives and satisfaction, the directors and the cooperative members who depend upon agricultural activity for a large percentage of their income have higher scores, compared with non-board members and members who are less dependent on agricultural activity (with a statistical significance of 1% and 5%, respectively). We also find that members who agree in more with the admission of new members, who think it is easy to recover their investments and who want to stay longer in the cooperative are those who are more willing to invest and to exert control. Furthermore, we find that members that prefer to have a participation in the assembly proportional to their contribution and that prefer that the cooperative diversifies more are those who are more willing to invest. In addition, control is favoured by members pertaining to the cooperative for a large period and for those members who think that investing in the cooperative is a high risk and who prefer long-term investments. Finally, directors are more willing to invest and to exert control.},

Model region comprises cadastral areas of Hlinné, Vyšný Žipov and Zlatník village. They are situated at the contact zone of two genetically distinct entities: Panónska panva basin and the Carpathians. It is a markedly heterogenous area, which has undergone considerable changes from the aspect of landscape heterogeneity development, particularly under the influence of collectivisation of agricultural production, industrialisation, development of communication networks and with that connected rise of built-up areas. The agriculture of the area and also landuse since 1826 has undergone considerable changes. There are agrarian terraces and ramparts, the oldest relics of the agricultural land use, which remained after farming on small fields, respectively plots. From an analysis of historical sources and results of field research can be concluded that the landscape preserved this character till early 50-ties of the 20 th century. The formation of agricultural cooperatives in the region and with this related intensification of agricultural production led to the disappearanc of agrarian terraces and ramparts on the one side by inclusion of them into forest communities in areas with higher slope. The agrarian terraces and ramparts have been preserved only in areas with the most exposed slope at the foothills of Slanské vrchy Mts in Zlatník and Vyšný Žipov in Beskydské predhorie hilly-land. Our presented methodology appears appropriate for evaluation of the heterogeneity of other rural landscape with occurrence of historical landscape structures not only in Central Europe.},

    abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyse the distribution pattern of cross bred dairy cattle and their management practices in cooperative dairy production systems in Bangladesh in order to design a standard management and breeding programme suitable for the dairy farmers in different areas under the cooperative for increasing animal productivity. The Bangladesh Milk Producers' Cooperatives Union Ltd (or 'Milk Vita' as its brand name) is the only cooperative operating in all over the country. This study was conducted in the Baghabarighat Milk Shed Area (BMSA) situated in Sirajgonj and Pabna district under Milk Vita. Five sub-districts, namely Shahjadpur, Faridpur, Ullahpara, Sathia and Bera and 30 villages under those sub-districts were selected. The selection of different sub-districts were based on in order of the distance from the Milk Vita centre (Shahjadpur is the closest and Bera is the most far). Three hundred sample dairy farmers were selected randomly. The data were collected by using pre-tested and pre-designed structured questionnaire by face-to-face interview. The results showed that about 98% of the dairy cattle are cross bred (Pabna Milking Cows with Holstein Friesian, Shahiwal, and Jersey). It has also been observed that the highest number of both total and milk cattle are available in Shahjadpur. Concerning the management practices such as use of concentrates, water use, and use of artificial insemination are better-off in Shahjadpur. This is due to the fact that this area is situated very close to the Milk Vita Centre and accordingly has better access to the centre and has more knowledge about the management and also gets higher services which are beneficial to them. This study suggests to adopt a strategic planning by the Milk Vita management board to implement a harmonised and standard management and breeding programme for all the farmers independent of the distance from the centre.},

However, what is missing in Global Commodity Chain (GCC) and Global Value Chain (GVC) analyses is an explanation of how governance structures change over time. In this paper I suggest that the production system associated with particular commodities is not the only factor shaping commodity chain governance. Rather, I argue that actors' strategies, regulation, and historical trajectories also influence and, in certain conjunctures, transform chain governance. Since regulations and actor strategies in competitive environments change over time, it follows that chain governance is dynamic. Drawing from the case of the Dutch cut flower agro-industry, the world's leading supplier of cut flowers, I build on the GCC, GVC and Global Production Network (GPN) literatures to illustrate how actor strategies, regulation and the historical trajectory of the Dutch cut flower GCC shape and change chain governance. What the Dutch cut flower case illustrates is how grower strategies and government policy facilitated the formation of grower cooperatives, and transformed the power relations between growers and buyers in a shift from a buyer to a producer-driven chain. © 2010 Clark University.},

    abstract = {The issues of food security and family sustenance have been a major problem in recent times. A large number of the urban populace has not been able to provide the food need of their family. Due to urban expansion, there is limited or no land for subsistence farming. The few that have the opportunity withdrew due to pilfering and competing time for office work, home and the farm. In order to deal with the crisis, civil servants formed cooperative societies which engaged in the bulk purchase of food items for the co-operators. The bill of food items purchased serves as loans which were deducted from their salaries. The study examines the effectiveness of cooperative societies in ensuring household food security and sustainability of civil servants in urban cities of Ondo state. A total of 180 civil servants were randomly selected and interviewed for the study. Findings show that majority 48.33% of the respondents patronize the consumer cooperative societies monthly to purchase the food need of the family, while 32.78% patronize the societies quarterly. The most important reason for patronizing being getting cheaper food prices than the market price and the ease of payment. Some at the end of the month, after all deductions made from their salaries, rarely have something to take home but believe in a Yoruba adage which says 'Tebi bati kuro ninu ise, ise buse ' literarily meaning that when hunger is out of poverty, then poverty is drastically reduced. Result of the probit model reveals a significant relationship between consumers' cooperatives and household food security, a positive significant relationship between educational status, income and food security. However, there is a negative relationship between family size and food security, indicating that the higher the family size, the greater the level of food insecurity.},

    abstract = {Purpose: A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on winter wheat, based on real agricultural practices databases, on a sample divided into four production scenarios. The main objectives of this study are (1) to assess the environmental impact of winter wheat, using an LCA covering field practices, and the transport and storage of grain until it is sold to a miller; (2) to use the USEtox model (Rosenbaum, et al.. in Int J Life Cycle Assess 13:532-546, 2008) to assess the part of the total freshwater ecotoxicity impact due to pesticide use, its variability among plots, and to identify the active ingredients with the strongest impact; (3) and with the help of fungicide, insecticide, herbicide experts, to identify active ingredients to replace these high-impact pesticides and estimate the effect of such a substitution on total freshwater ecotoxicity. Materials and methods: InVivo (the authors' company) is a French union of agricultural cooperatives that produces and sells, amongst other products and services, decision-making tools to help farmers manage fertilization and pesticide applications. With the help of cooperatives and with the help of these tools, pedologic, climatologic and agronomic (in particular for fertilization and pesticide applications practices) data can be collected for each agricultural plot of a farm. Results and discussion: The main conclusions of this study are that : (1) when considering freshwater ecotoxicity impacts, pesticide use is predominant on the whole life cycle of winter wheat, (2) there is a huge scattering of the results observed between fields when compared to the low scattering of the results between the four production scenarios, (3) it is feasible, with the USEtox model, to identify the active ingredients with the strongest impact and to potentially decrease this average impact by 50% by substituting only three active ingredients. Conclusions: A further step to improve ecotoxicity assessment in LCA would be to develop a model to better estimate the pesticide emissions pattern on field, taking into account pedo-climatic conditions and farmers' practices. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

An important strand of this 'new institutionalism' is historical institutionalism. Recent theoretical developments have sought to address the most obvious criticisms of the historical institutionalist approach, particularly the critique relating to its tendency to focus on explanations of stability. However, the institutional histories under consideration are generally incomplete as they do not include the entire life of the institution. Drawing on the history of collective wheat marketing in Australia, this article seeks to address this gap by considering a case in which strategies of institutional reproduction initially appeared to have managed change successfully but ultimately sowed the seeds of institutional demise. By considering the death as well as the life of an institution, we can gain a clearer picture of the effectiveness of institutional strategies of adaptation and change. © 2010 The Author.

This new method of business concentration is presented as an alternative to mergers and acquisitions. With this in mind the article first looks at how the environment has been affected by the consequences of the crisis within the sector.

The idea to be advanced is that the nature of the governance problems is contingent on where in the cooperative's production chain the main sources of uniqueness and product differentiation have their origin. When the uniqueness of the end-product is created at the raw-commodity level (on-farm), haggling over appropriable quasi-rent between members and the cooperative is likely to emerge, leading to a hold-up situation. When the uniqueness of the differentiated end-product is created at the cooperative level, the cooperative community is likely to be exposed to consequential incentive problems related to motivation and control. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

A set of both closed and open-ended questionnaires was used to collect data on agribusinesses. The results from the study revealed that primary production was creating more employment opportunities as compared to agro-processing. However, gross margin analysis showed that the mean gross margin was higher in agro-processing when compared with primary production businesses. The main constraints facing agribusinesses were: lack of working capital, lack of management skills, and marketing related problems. Financial support and skills training were identified as necessary strategies to overcome lack of working capital, management skills, while the problem of marketing could be solved by the creation of a marketing co-operative in the area. The study findings revealed that performance of agribusinesses depended on the management style, capital invested, final product produced, income generated and employment generated.

The results of our evaluation of the ability of Fair Trade to meet its objectives indicate that Fair Trade's opportunities to provide a significant price premium for participating farmers largely depend on world coffee prices in mainstream markets.

Several studies exist on the causes and effects of poor water quality, and on possible solutions for effluent control in these two economically important production systems. However, only a small number of Vietnamese farms apply these reduction options, raising questions over the state-enforced compliance with legislated water-quality measures. Voluntary standards and certification networks have recently emerged as alternative forms of water-quality governance in Vietnamese aquaculture. This paper examines a number of ongoing and interlinked international, national and community level initiatives on (voluntary) standards and certification that aim to promote sustainable shrimp and pangasius aquaculture in Vietnam. The results indicate the potential, but also challenges, in the development and implementation of national and international standards and demonstrate the need for more attention to the role of local institutions like producer co-operatives in multi-level governance arrangements. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {Field polyfactorial experiments were realized on fields of the Agricultural Co-operative in Nitrianska Blatnica in years 2007-2009. Experimental field is located in the maize production area (climatic region: warm; climatic sub region dry; climatic zone: warm, dry with mild winter and long sunshine) in altitude 250 m above sea level, with brown soil. We observed the influence of both temperature and moisture conditions of experimental area on sunflower yield of achenes (conventional, medium-late hybrids: NK Brio, NK Armoni). Preceding crop of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) every experimental year was wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Technological system of sunflower cultivation was realized in accordance with conventional technology of cultivation. The basic fertilization was made by balance method on the base of agrochemical soil analysis for expected yield 3 t.ha-1. The meteorological data were got out from agrometeorological station of the Central Controlling and Testing Institute in Agriculture in Vel'ke Ripňany. During every experimental year the change of inner energy (ΔU) was evaluated for thermodynamic characteristic analysis (security of the temperature and moisture) and the impact of changes on yield forming with maximal yield (Ymaxin 2008) and minimal yield (Ymin in 2009). Achieved value of yield from thermal and precipitation energy introduces concrete energy amount, which is available in given period for concrete height of yield. From the results follow, the sunflower has got critical thermodynamic phase in the period of months from July to August. For the yield formation is requirement, that input power of precipitation prevailed over the thermal during moths July to August. Achieved results confirmed statistically high significant dependence of the yield on weather conditions and for high annual variations in climatic characteristics the consideration is needed about potential changes some agrotechnological measures of technological system of sunflower cultivation.},

This study, informed by the "survival versus liberation" thesis, examines sponsorship of cash programs, employment programs, and credit unions for a national sample of 1,863 Black churches across seven denominations. Results show the tendency for Black churches to sponsor economic programs to meet more short-term needs rather than address systemic issues. Moreover, findings from logistic regression modeling suggest limited denominational effects, but a positive relationship between churches that espouse a more liberative stance and economic program sponsorship-particularly programs associated with more long-term benefits. Furthermore, Black churches that offer more educational and contemplative religious programs and that have the requisite human resources and organizational structure appear best positioned to offer these economic programs.

In this study, insolvency was classified as the cooperative wich: failed to send statements to the Central Bank of Brazil, had negative equity or negative adjusted net worth, or even if it were classified in the following situations by the Central Bank of Brazil: paralyzed, in liquidation, canceled/closed and in ordinary liquidation. From a database of 9,456 observations collected from a sample of 112 cooperatives affiliated to Sicoob-Crediminas between January 1995 and May 2008, a set of Logit class models were estimated. The results obtained with the best fit allow us to infer that the financial ratios “Allowance for Loan Losses/ Allowances Required for Overdue Loans”, “Non-Financial Investments/Total Assets”, “Non-Earning Assets/Total Assets”, and “Services Income/ Managerial Expenses” were the most relevant in determining the likelihood of insolvency of cooperatives in our sample. These results support the hypothesis that the monitoring of financial accounting ratios of the Pearls system, which has not been the focus of the traditional analysis of balance sheets, is important for determining the probability of insolvency of credit unions, assisting their managers in identifying risk factors, as well as in creating a benchmark for comparing the performance of cooperatives, facilitating the supervision process by regulators. However, expansion of the estimated results for subsequent periods and other credit unions in Brazil must be done carefully, with alternative specifications to be evaluated in order to capture changes in the economic and administrative structure of the cooperatives, which may influence their accounting and financial indicators. © 2011 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

Data envelopment analysis is used to explore changes in efficiency in merged credit unions between 1996 and 2001. Those credit unions not involved in merger activity are used as a control group. Overall, credit unions have become more efficient over the period, notably in those that undertook mergers.

This paper discussed the livelihood impacts of oil palm development in Indonesia, based on lessons learnt from Bungo district, in the province of Jambi. The various community-company partnerships that structure the sector are reviewed and the difficulties raised by the joint ventures schemes are discussed. The merits and drawbacks of oil palm as a smallholder crop are then analysed, based on household socio-economic surveys conducted in 2007-2010. The main causes of conflicts between oil palm companies and communities are unclear land tenure, and a recurrent lack of leadership in smallholders' cooperatives. Under fair partnerships between smallholders and companies, oil palm could become a smallholder friendly crop. The land-use profitability analysis demonstrates the high returns that can be generated by oil palm independent smallholdings, making it highly competitive with rubber, and much more profitable than rice production. © 2010 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

The study determines the economic income from Fairtrade coffee throughout the chain as well as exploring the benefits and consequences of Fairtrade for local producers in Nicaragua and Guatemala. Our analysis shows that consumer countries acquire the larger share of economic income, mainly because Fairtrade is positioned within the conventional market where large multinationals control the supply chain. The participation of large multinationals has led to increasing pressure and tough competition for the certified producer cooperatives in the Fairtrade market. On the consumer side, while consumer marketing narratives emphasize producer benefits of Fairtrade, our results demonstrate that its total benefits for primary producers is modest. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

Besides, the analysis also considers the impact that bank market power and firm opaqueness exert on the amount of credit a firm can obtain. The empirical evidence leads to three main conclusions. Firstly, the financing of cooperative firms does not seem to be favored by credit cooperatives. By contrast, and this is the second finding, a synergetic relationship exists between commercial banks and cooperative firms, as it is from this typology of banks that cooperatives seem to receive more credit. Finally, cooperative firms are less likely to receive bank loans in less competitive local credit markets, even though this impact is decreasing for less opaque firms. © International Economic Society.},

However, what the Party has not wanted reformed, and has fought strongly on behalf of, is culture. Using primary source official CPV cultural policy documentation and secondary sources highlighting contemporary meanings of Vietnamese and foreign cultures, this paper evaluates the Party's use of culture as a resource in the direction and regulation of the nation's market economy with a socialist orientation. While culture is expedient for all governments, I argue that the CPV's intent is unique in that it uses culture as an instrument to maintain its ownership, rather than simply to legitimize its regulatory ability, over the national political economy. This paper aims to show how culture is part and parcel of post-socialist governance's political-economic framework and contributes to debates surrounding the reach and impact of neoliberalism in formerly command economies. © 2011.},

A sample of 44 households with commercial poultry farms were surveyed through structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, linear and logit regression models. The results revealed that men participated more on management activities such as vaccination, administration of drugs, debeaking and chicks procurement while women were more engaged in daily routine activities like cleaning of pens, provision of water, sorting of eggs etc. Furthermore women enjoyed about 53.6% level of involvement in farm decision making and only about 28.7% rate of accessibility to farm resources. Major determinants of the rate of accessibility of resources by women were flock size, years of experience, primary occupation, access to credit, cooperative participation and level of income. The determinants of decision making among women are age, years of experience, occupation, cooperative membership and income level. The study recommends that poultry production activities which have been identified to be of interest to women must be used as an avenue for empowering them. Input subsidies and credit facilities must be made available and easily accessible by the women. The women must be given maximum consideration with regards to extension service to inform, educate and train them on the use of recommended practices and technologies. They should be encouraged to participate in cooperative society in order to leverage the opportunity of access to farm resources.},

Thus, in contrast to the view of TPC as an objective governance mechanism, we argue that TPC is embedded in social, political and economic networks. This finding, we argue, raises questions as to how TPC is structured and operates, who gets to decide the ways it is structured and operates, and the ways that TPC might differentially impact on actors in the food and agricultural sector. © 2008 The Authors.

This paper explores the politics that have arisen from changes in the governance framework in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The focus is on the privatisation of the management of city markets and on the relations between the multiple actors involved-private contractors, vendors' associations, cooperatives and state actors. In particular, the paper looks into the implications of the privatisation process for vendors and their associations. It argues that, while the latter have sometimes adjusted to the changes by turning into cooperative societies or creating their own management firms, increasingly, however, private interests external to the markets are taking over the management functions, sidelining or even repressing, vendors' associations. The general picture is one of weakening associations and endangered possibilities for broad-based organising and interest representation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

By presenting cases of the Tohoku region-one of the main paddy rice-producing regions in Japan-the spatial distribution of new rice varieties after the 1990s is recapitulated as follows: (1) at the regional level, distinct regional differentiation appeared with the emergence of main rice varieties in each prefecture; (2) at the prefecture level, planted areas of paddy rice decreased and the percentage of the main rice variety increased; and (3) throughout the regional and prefectural levels, the naming of new rice varieties was simplified and generalized. In the process of development and distribution of the new varieties of paddy rice, some conditions are considered as the commodification of the paddy rice-producing centers: (1) corresponding with recent market demands, new varieties with good flavor were constantly bred and spread; (2) values of some of the new varieties increased by being designated as "regional brand-name varieties"; and (3) the primary new rice varieties were introduced simultaneously by individual farms according to marketing strategies developed by prefectural and municipal administrations and agricultural cooperatives. As for future proposals, the regional riceproducing centers will have to cooperate with small and medium-size enterprises that have the singular technology to produce new varieties. Agricultural subsidies to address the aging of farmers and increasing idle farmland are also needed. ©2010 The Association of Japanese Geographers.},

    abstract = {The aim of this work is to analyze irrigation for food production in the municipal districts of Petrolina, in the State of Pernambuco (PE), Juazeiro, in the State of Bahia (BA), and Vale do Açu and Ceará-Mirim, in the State of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), all of which are located in the semi-arid northeastern region of Brazil. In Petrolina and Juazeiro, the highest productivity rates are achieved in cultivating grapes and mangos, considered the principal fruits for the export market. The infrastructure in the irrigated perimeters includes the availability of water and electric power supply for both large and small producers alike. In Vale do Açu, the 1969 construction of the Armando Ribeiro Gonçalves Dam, with holding capacity of up to 2.7 billion liters of water, sought to enhance conditions for local residents by settling them on the land and making it possible for them to engage in agricultural production in the irrigated perimeter of the Lower Açu River. This region is the biggest producer of bananas in the entire country. In addition, for 8 years now, the Ceará-Mirim Valley has been the location of a farming cooperative called Agrovila Canudos, where 120 families are settled on an area measuring 1.3 thousand hectares. At present, just 19 families work in the cooperative and obtain satisfactory results in irrigated agriculture and other projects, such as fish-farming and cultivation of Jatropha curcas (physic nut) shrubs for use in the production of biodiesel fuel. © 2009 WIT Press.},

Approximately 35-40% of people from this unemployment group have already no more chance to be reintegrated into the labour market. The analysis points to out the regional occurrence of this type of unemployment (less urbanised sub-mountain areas, stagnating and backward regions facing various processes of de-industrialisation, etc) and evaluates its wider socio-economic impacts. After 2000, the fragmentation of employment contracts in the corporative types of farms (agricultural co-operatives and companies) begins to appear in the agricultural sector. The category of seasonal agricultural workers with decreased labour and social protection begins to emerge as well. As a result of the strategy to cope with the situation, a certain self-supplying (subsistence farming) subculture was established in the Slovak rural areas to mitigate the difficult economic conditions of the rural households endangered by income deprivation, including the decreased purchasing power of rural populalion.},

Influence costs are higher in cooperatives than in investor-oriented firms due to the unique governance structure of the former. Hypotheses are formulated and tested regarding the relationship between influence costs and seven variables: membership size, member heterogeneity, average member age, singleness of purpose, managerial power over members, level of managerial compensation, and professional versus inside management. The main results are that heterogeneous member preferences, older average member age, and investment in multiple product lines all contribute to higher influence costs. At the same time, cooperatives with well-paid, powerful, and professional managers incur lower influence costs. The impact of membership size on the level of influence costs is undetermined. © 2010 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Newly emerging nations in the developing world put great efforts into developing multi-purpose co-operative societies that, it was hoped, would bring the benefits of development to the rural poor. With some exceptions these failed to live up to expectations; having been created by governments they remained controlled by the interests of government, party and civil service. Then, under structural adjustment programmes they either collapsed or were reformed. Some new, more genuine co-operative sectors are now emerging. As they do, co-operatives face new challenges brought about by continuing processes of economic globalisation, the IT revolution, and changes in the national and international balance of powers. To survive and thrive, the ability for co-operative organisations to network effectively at both the local level and beyond is becoming increasingly important. This paper seeks to examine the relevance of the numerous theoretical perspectives on network formation and network management to the newly-emerging co-operative sectors in the developing world. Such networks are being built both within the co-operative sector itself (e.g. through federation) and with a range of other bodies, each locally, nationally and internationally. The paper seeks to provide a framework for understanding the processes that drive the formation of relationships, networks and partnerships, and asks questions of how such alliances can be governed and managed effectively. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

    abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether or not financial repression exists in the saving and investment activities of farm households in rural areas of China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically investigates repression in rural China using the McKinnon-Shaw model and microeconomic data combined with lending and savings rates and ceilings by rural credit cooperatives. Findings - The paper finds only limited evidence of a repression dominated by savings, while investment response appears to be, at least on average, normal or unrepressed. More specifically, the paper finds that the relationship between growth and investment is consistent with an unrepressed economy but savings do show evidence of repression. Originality/value - The political focus of economic reformation in China has been one of rapid economic growth in urban areas and a neglect of the agriculture sector. This focus on urban growth has led some Chinese scholars to speculate that the residual impact is a repressed agricultural and rural economy, at least in the context of McKinnon and Shaw framework. However, such speculations have not previously been verified. This paper presents the first attempt to determine the relationships exclusively in the context of the agricultural economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Hence, I offer a reflexive ethnographic description of "short-life" co-op living based on a five year account of managing vacant properties that await refurbishment or re-development by two major Charitable Housing Trusts based in West London. In questioning how tenants deal with the constant threat of having to move, I ask how members of a short-life housing co-op create their own sense of self and stability through a temporary form of accommodation. My goal is thus to investigate how these co-op tenants appropriate space, relocate themselves and cope with transient domestic alienability. The creative formulation of individual and community identities are central to the wider understanding and implications of residential instability, alternative lifestyles and the general underlying ethos of co-operative organizations. © 2008 by the American Anthropological Association.

    abstract = {Financial inclusion measures initiated in India to contain financial abandonment have hardly taken the demand side factors at grass roots level into consideration. The authorities of implementation, including the Reserve Bank of India, operate under the presumption that the financial inclusion initiatives have trickled down automatically to the lowest administrative unit at village level and have brought respite into the lives of the hitherto financially excluded sections. However, reality on the ground is entirely different and the situation remains unchanged. Since these measures have had hadly any impct on the financially excluded sections of society, the incidence of financial abandonment remains unchanged at the lowest administrative unit. Surprisingly, people at the grass root level are not familiar and have not even lieard about the financial inclusion measures. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect the necessary change to occur in the absence of any financial institution, like commercial bank or cooperative society at lowest administration unit level. Also, the conspicuous absence of rural credit cooperative societies and selfhelp group organizations has further worsened the situation in rural areas. This paper, besides identifying the failures of the financial inclusion measures from the perspective of the lowest administrative unit, attempts to bring the demand side factors to the forefront, including the business potential that exists for financial institutions, and effective administration of financial services by the formal financial system and other newly emerged institutions like self-help groups.},

In South Africa, renewed interest in development-oriented cooperatives saw the introduction of a new Cooperatives Act in 2005, along with support measures dedicated to 'emerging' cooperatives. This paper contends that the architects of the new Act discounted important trends in international legislation that would have made development-oriented cooperatives more versatile and given their members better access to capital and expertise through equity partnerships with private agribusiness firms. It is concluded that the new Act should be amended to admit non-patron investors as members, and to allow for non- redeemable and hence appreciable and tradable shares. Such innovations are emerging internationally, usually with a cap on non-patron voting power.},

I focus on the process by which producers are connected to retailers, and show that search costs between producers and retailers can be an important fixed cost of entry. Reduced search costs result in a larger number of matches, and facilitate the growth of niche market channels selling on the basis of producer identity.

    abstract = {At the end of the nineteenth century, and more pronouncedly between the two World Wars, Jews in Eastern Europe created wide networks of credit cooperatives, which at their peak supported about a third of the non-Soviet Jewish population in Eastern Europe. The establishment and continuous management of these cooperatives were greatly assisted by the two major Jewish philanthropic organizations of the period, the Jewish Colonization Association (JCA) and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC). These organizations acted as charitable institutions but also as third-sector organizations which aspired both to assist and to socially engineer East European Jewish society. In British Mandate Palestine a Zionist branch of the movement was established, which was, however, free from the influences of these philanthropic organizations. The article describes and analyzes this little-researched phenomenon while seeking to place it within the theoretical frameworks of philanthropy and transnationalism. It concludes with an observational comparison between the political context in which Jewish credit cooperatives were created, namely East European ethnic regimes, and the Israeli ethnic democracy.},

The study is based on primary data randomly collected as part of collaborative study of cassava in semiarid zones of Africa (COSCASSA) village level survey from five West African countries namely: Nigeria, Ghana, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso. This study models effects of farm, farmer and technology specific factors on the decision of semi arid farmers to adopt cassava into their farming system. By way of threshold decision models-Probit and Logit models, the estimation of each country and the pooled data adoption models reveal different adoption models for the countries considered. For each country, different variables appeared as major adoption shifters. Comparatively, the adoption models for Nigeria and whole region appear to have the highest significance variables, being seven in number. This is followed by Chad (6), Ghana (4), and Burkina Faso and Niger with three each. For the variables considered, distance to nearby urban market appears a major adoption shifter in all the country, except for Niger. This is closely followed by contact with extension, variety, pest/disease resistance and livestock feeds, which appear significant in four of the countries. Membership of cooperative societies appears as the least adoption predictor, which is only significant in Chad republic. The study therefore recognizes the importance of varietial characteristics and farmers' characteristics in acceptance of cassava as a major root tuber crop in the semi arid region of West Africa. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The cooperatives' degree of success is measured as members' commitment towards cooperatives, and members' trust in the board of directors. The data originate from a mail survey among 2,250 Swedish farmers. The results indicate differences in members' commitment and their trust towards directors to be due to farm profitability, the members' age and experience as directors. After adding members' perception of their participation in the governance as a covariate, most of the other differences are explained by this variable. Age is still partly associated with trust towards directors; older farmers have less trust. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The high and low NFC group's scores on the Event Management Questionnaire (Smith, Peterson & Schwartz, 2002) were then compared as to the effect their own experiences and coworkers of equal hierarchical rank had on managing workplace events. The results supported the hypothesis that NFC would be negatively related to the reliance on coworkers, but did not support the hypothesis that NFC would be positively related to reliance on the managers' prior experience. Post Hoc analysis revealed that the relationship between NFC and reliance on coworkers was only significant in the case of female respondents.},

    abstract = {This study concerns the political, economic and socio-psychological conditions for marketing and supply cooperatives in Russian agriculture. An analysis of secondary data indicates that neither political nor economic conditions inhibit the development of cooperatives. Therefore, the focus is directed towards the socio-psychological factors. The aim of the study is to empirically explore the extent to which socio-psychological factors explain the difficulties for agricultural cooperative development within the Kurgan region of the Russian Federation. Based on literature concerning cooperative members' attitudes, values, commitment and similar variables, four hypotheses are suggested. These are tested empirically on the basis of data from a total of 927 agricultural producers, both members and nonmembers of existing cooperatives. The findings reveal that especially the level of trust in others is crucial. Furthermore, the involvement is low among nonmembers, their attitudes to cooperatives are poor, and their belief and experience in democratic governance are weak.},

    abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to argue that the legacy of instrumental rationality has had a profoundly impoverishing effect on rational accounts of organisation, and that even though non-rational accounts move beyond instrumental rationality, they remain tied to economist assumptions. The paper outlines the broader Weber and Habermas's model of rationality, and demonstrates its application. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on verbatim quotes from a sampling of 35 in-depth interviews, the paper reveals the range of very different rationalities expressed in the social relations of work, of four very specific types of organisation: a bureaucracy, an entrepreneurial unit, a producer co-operative and a worker co-operative. Findings – The paper outlines two ideal sets of findings, ideal in the sense that in two of the organisations the rationalities, social relations of work and associated outcomes fit well with the Weber and Habermas model of instrumental strategic action and social strategic action. Research limitations/implications – This study shows the potential for broader rationality as it plays out in the workplace. The notion of workplaces that free workers to contribute in socially strategic ways points to new approaches to management and organisation. Practical implications – The paper offers practical insights into social relations built on co-operation, moral judgement and communication. Originality/value – The power of the idea of broader rationality is that being more rational, i.e. attending to more than a narrow impoverished view, provides the prospect of action advancing the social and the economic in a profound way. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Yet, persistent market failures in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa have limited the impact of this strategy. As a result, there is increasing interest in the study of state and community failures - the underlying rural governance issues - that affect small-scale farmers. This paper contributes to this area of inquiry by examining the role of farmers' cooperatives in local governance systems in Ethiopia. By drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data sources, the paper offers new insights into the potential role of rural governance systems in national development strategies, the interactions between formal and informal rural governance systems, and possible avenues through which farmers' cooperatives can contribute to improving rural governance and national development.

    abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to assess in quantitative terms farmers' perceptions of sustainable agriculture and to determine how those are influenced by different socio-economic characteristics and information-seeking behavior of the farmers. The study was conducted in Kahramanmaras province of Turkey and comprised a stratified sample of 208 farmers from four districts of the province. The farmers rated each of the 21 selected sustainable agricultural practices for importance on a 5-point scale, and the total of these ratings formed the sustainable agriculture perception index. The index score was calculated for each farmer and was treated as the dependent variable in the stepwise regression analysis procedure. The independent variables were such socio-economic characteristics as the farming system, the total and irrigated area of the farm, membership of a cooperative society and participation in village administration, and age, education, and income of the farmer; components of information-seeking behavior included use of the mass media (newspapers, radio, and television), use of the Internet, travel, and participation in farming events. The results of the study showed that the higher the socio-economic status (more frequent contact with extension services, higher education, ownership of land, etc.) and the greater the access to information, the greater the perceived importance of sustainable agricultural practices. It is concluded that if policy-makers and extension organizations concentrate on these factors, they are more likely to succeed in making farmers more favorably disposed toward sustainable agriculture. © Springer Science + Business Media, B.V. 2008.},

Theileria piroplasms were observed in 9.8% and 16.2% of calves of < 42 days and > 42 days, respectively. Lymph nodes of calves < 6 weeks were not enlarged while enlargement rates in 43-56, 57-69 and > 70 days old calves were 41.5%, 40.3%, 34.9%, respectively. Packed cell volumes, haemoglobin concentration, red and white blood cell counts were low in all calves. After four years of continuous dipping analysis indicated a net benefit of US $ 116,278.60 and that the endemic stability model reduced amount of acaricides used. Calving rates increased from <40% to >75%, disease incidence rates declined, calf mortalities decreased from >41.5% to < 2% and calf survival rates increased from 58% to 98%.

Agricultural cooperatives have long played an important role in helping their members manage risk. However, agricultural cooperatives seem not to be particularly good at helping their members to manage production risk, which involves variation in yield over the course of several years. Agricultural producers face various sorts of risk some of which are difficult to manage using standard institutions. The cooperative must deploy a different mechanism if it is to help members manage shocks to output. Inducing members to commit to deliver their entire production to the cooperative would require that shares in the cooperative be allocated in rough proportion to members' expected production. Agricultural cooperatives could perfectly share yield risk among their members by pooling total revenues from all their members and then distributing these revenues in proportion to members' shares.},

This decision problem represents the optimization of crop design and can be treated by the methods of linear programming which begun to be extensively used in agriculture production planning in USA during 50's. There is ongoing research of mathematical programming applications in agriculture worldwide, but the results are not easily transferable to other localities due to the specific local restrictions in each country.

However, the mathematical programming approach enables find the true optimal solution of the problem, which especially in the problems with a great number of constraints is not easy to find intuitively. One of the possible barriers for using the general decision support systems (which are based on mathematical programming methods) for agriculture production planning in Czech Republic is its expensiveness. The small farmer can not afford to buy the expensive software or to employ a mathematical programming specialist. The aim of this paper is to present a user friendly linear programming model of the typical agricultural production planning problem in Czech Republic which can be solved via software tools commonly available in any farm (e.g. EXCEL). The linear programming model covering the restrictions on total costs, crop rotation, thresholds for the total area sowed by particular crops, total amount of manure and the need of feed crops is developed. The model is applied in real-world problem of Czech agriculture cooperative and the results of its solution are compared to the real decision made. The applicability of the model in every day agriculture managerial practice in Czech Republic is discussed and its possible enlargement is mentioned.},

    abstract = {Capital management by mutual financial institutions (such as credit unions) provides a valuable testing ground for assessing the impact of capital regulation and theories of managerial behaviour in financial institutions. Limited access to external equity capital means that capital accumulation must be met primarily by reliance on retained earnings. To deal with shocks to the capital position and avoid breaching regulatory requirements, managers will aim to have a buffer of capital in excess of the regulatory minimum. Moreover, mutual governance arrangements and an absence of capital market discipline mean that managers have discretion to set target capital ratios which differ significantly from industry averages. This paper develops a formal model of capital management and risk management in mutual financial institutions such as credit unions which reflects these industry characteristics. The model is tested using data from larger credit unions in Australia, which have been subject to the Basel Accord Risk Weighted Capital Requirements since 1993. The data supports the hypothesis that credit unions manage their capital position by setting a short term target profit rate (return on assets) which is positively related to asset growth and which is aimed at gradually removing discrepancies between the actual and desired capital ratio. Desired capital ratios vary significantly across credit unions. There is little evidence of short run adjustments to the risk of the asset portfolio to achieve a desired capital position. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {For 2 decades, calls for Australian rangeland landholders to expand their reliance on the abundant species of native kangaroos and decrease their reliance on introduced stock have been made. These calls have received recent impetus from the challenge of climate change. Arguments for landholder involvement in kangaroo production include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, better management of total grazing pressure, reduced land degradation, improved vegetation and biodiversity outcomes, and greater valuation of kangaroos by landholders. However, there is little understanding of how landholders could be involved in kangaroo harvest and production, and there is a widespread misconception that this would include domestication, fencing, mustering and trucking. This paper reviews the options for landholder involvement in managing and harvesting wild kangaroos, and assesses the possible benefits and feasibility of such options. We conclude that collaboration among landholders, as well as between landholders and harvesters, forms the basis of any preferred option, and set out a proposed operating model based on the formation of a kangaroo management, processing and marketing co-operative. © 2009 Australian Rangeland Society.},

However, whereas there are practical applications implemented in banks, there are rarely empirical studies about this legal form of banking system. Nowadays, the financial crisis is affecting the development of certain industries and territories. Credit unions, as singular financial organizations, have intangible elements with peculiar characteristics. These characteristics must be studied to manage their competitive advantages and provide management with relevant information for decision making. Through the Delphi analysis, this article will identify the singularities of human capital in these entities. The singularities of the credit union sector show that human resources are potentially more determined to adopt a strong corporate culture and invest more in training. On the other hand, main deficits of credit unions will be their aptitudes and lesser capacities, academic level or low investment in training.},

    abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a case study showing how the selection of performance indices affects performance results and the evaluation of a firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach - This paper employs a data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework using four kinds of performance indices selection, which include basic input/output items, balance scorecard (BSC) indices, balanced scorecard with risk management, and traditional financial indices, to evaluate banking operations. Findings - Shows that a DEA-based evaluation of performance produces a similar view of the firm's well-being as does an analysis of financial indices; however, a BSC-based evaluation produces a different assessment. Research limitations/implications - This study was based on the following assumptions: first, when organizational units achieve technical efficiency, they will improve their organizational performance. Secondly, the inputs and outputs selected for the data envelopment analysis provided an indicator of the changes of bank's technical efficiency over the six-year period. Practical implications - This research was based on the data envelopment analysis approach to find different performance efficiency to apply four performance indicator selections, which include basic inputs/outputs items, balanced scorecard indices, balanced scorecard with risk management, and traditional financial indices, to evaluate bank operation. Originality/value - Combines the balanced scorecard concept with data envelopment analysis measurements (model information) to generate measures of technical efficiency for a Taiwanese bank. It shows how comparisons can be made within and across companies on the basis of balanced scorecard measures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Management of the assets and liabilities of credit unions is similar to other financial institutions because similar financial risks need to be balanced while meeting their first and foremost objective -- maximization of their shareholder's wealth. However, the risks are somewhat different because of the size, geographic concentration, liquidity needs and extension of credit only to its members. Geographic concentration limits the need for evaluation relative to the financial strengths and ability to assess and adequately monitor the risks of the investments. A small size credit union may manage risks by investing all of the surplus funds in a corporate credit union instead of investing in securities. However, the growth of credit union's assets and liabilities poses challenges for management in understanding risks and returns. Credit union management often uses a laddered portfolio as a tool to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. In this approach, investment maturities are laddered to provide necessary cash flows. This paper presents how fuzzy goal programming techniques can be efficiently applied in developing sophisticated investment decision making models to provide feasible solutions for credit union portfolio management problems for constructing efficient portfolios. We have formulated additive and weighted additive models for investment decisions using fuzzy goal programming. The results are tested based on scenario analysis for the data selected for the study. Additionally, comparison of the results from both models related to achievements of targeted goals and preferences is also presented. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.},

They consider a market where farmers produce a vertically-differentiated commodity which can either be high-quality (H) or low-quality (L), where consumers always prefer H over L. Farmers are assumed initially to be homogeneous in their ability to produce H product. Tina and Richard then consider optimal cooperative pooling in a market where farmers can exit the cooperative in favor of a competitive marketing arrangement. All marketing firms operate with zero marginal cost. They demonstrate that traditional revenue pooling can confer two strategic advantages in a quality-differentiated market. Firstly pooling attenuates the incentive of competitive farmers to overproduce high-quality product and secondly, it insures risk-averse farmers against adverse realizations of quality.},

    abstract = {Nested analysis of variance is used to identify the sources of variation in performance, measured by growth of membership and growth of assets, for a large sample of US credit unions. The analysis reveals that sector effects (geographic, common bond and charter type) account for only relatively small proportions of the variation in performance. This raises doubts as to whether credit unions are likely to benefit much from competitive repositioning at sector level (by changing their charter type or common bond designation). It may be that the perceived benefit derived from such manoeuvrings is greater than the actual benefit, or it may be that the large number of credit unions seeking a more permissive operating environment has ended up negating any potential gain in performance across the sector as a whole. In contrast to the limited role identified for sector effects, individual credit union effects explain a large proportion of the variation in performance. This suggests that decisions made by individual credit unions with respect to staffing, governance and product portfolio, as well as philosophy and ethos, play an important role in explaining the heterogeneity in credit union performance.},

Specifically, the result shows that only about 2% of costs are wasted, on average, relative to a best-practice firm facing the same conditions. Meanwhile, the mean profit estimates for the 14-year period is 92%. Credit cooperatives with a greater number of women employees are more cost- and profit-efficient. However, the dominance of women as members incurs more cost and thus less profit. This raises the issue of having MFIs targeting only women as well as the concern for higher monitoring costs for them, which imply higher total costs and less profits. © Canadian Association for the Study of International Development, 2009.},

The number of farming families has decreased by 46% between 1971 and 2006 (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006, Customised Data), therefore the re-evaluation of farming methods seems appropriate. Traditional family farming, co-operative and corporate farming, as well as cross-boundary farming is discussed. The latter is a form of collective farming: it means individual title, but collective ownership and management. These issues will be examined through a literature review and commentary. This system has worked well for many years in Europe (ABC Landline, 2001). In Australia, a group of academics and landholders worked this system successfully for six years; it was called common property resources system (Williamson, Brunckhorst and Kelly, 2003). It encouraged flexibility and shared labour, and there was economic, ecological and environmental success. Why was the system abandoned? Rural communities depend upon the sustainability of the surrounding land and farms, but the persisting drought and degradation of the land has led to a decline in the social and economic viability of life in rural areas. Sustainability requires a re-thinking of the landscape, which, in turn, requires a re-thinking of eco-ethical values and biodiversity, as well as having a holistic approach.

Higher tree richness was associated with higher soil pH, CEC, Ca, and Mg, and lower K. Higher tree densities were associated with lower N, K, and organic matter. Although we found differences in the incidence of provisioning services (e.g., fruit), all plantations generated products other than coffee. No differences were observed between C-stocks.

    abstract = {This study was conducted to compare three models: two random regression models with and without considering heterogeneity in the residual variances and a lactation model (LM) for evaluating the genetic ability of Holstein cows in Korea. Two datasets were prepared for this study. To apply the test-day random regression model, 94,390 test-day records were prepared from 15,263 cows. The second data set consisted of 14,704 lactation records covering milk production over 305 days. Raw milk yield and composition data were collected from 1998 to 2002 by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation's dairy cattle improvement center by way of its milk testing program, which is nationally based. The pedigree information for this analysis was collected by the Korean Animal Improvement Association. The random regression models (RRMs) are single-trait animal models that consider each lactation record as an independent trait. Estimates of covariance were assumed to be different ones. In order to consider heterogeneity of residual variance in the analysis, test-days were classified into 29 classes. By considering heterogeneity of residual variance, variation for lactation performance in the early lactation classes was higher than during the middle classes and variance was lower in the late lactation classes than in the other two classes. This may be due to feeding management system and physiological properties of Holstein cows in Korea. Over classes e6 to e26 (covering 61 to 270 DIM), there was little change in residual variance, suggesting that a model with homogeneity of variance be used restricting the data to these days only. Estimates of heritability for milk yield ranged from 0.154 to 0.455, for which the estimates were variable depending on different lactation periods. Most of the heritabilities for milk yield using the RRM were higher than in the lactation model, and the estimate of genetic variance of milk yield was lower in the late lactation period than in the early or middle periods.},

    abstract = {The object of the present article is to offer a decomposition of productivity indices incorporating environmental changes. The model followed is an input oriented approach related to undesirable output (environmental performance attribute) in horticultural marketing cooperatives. This study is motivated by both the lack of analysis of environmental performance's effects on agribusiness productivity and the relevance of cooperative firms in the European agricultural model for attaining sustainability. For this purpose, bootstrapped envelopment analysis is applied and the best practice frontier obtained corresponds to decision making units showing the best environmental behaviour. The Malmquist total factor productivity (TFP) is decomposed into technological change, efficiency and environmental change. In the second stage, the correlations of these changes with other management variables of cooperatives are analysed. The indicators obtained, on one hand, advice about the nonseparable distance function estimations when the environmental factor is introduced. On the other hand, the results display a relevant increase in efficiency and environmental components for the period under study showing a high influence from labour qualification, environmental effort and spillover effect in the sector.},

In addition, the role of leading bank holding companies is found to be important in stimulating entry of smaller rivals. This article finds that credit union entry responds in a similar way, and in addition that the state-level financial regulatory climate matters. An ordered-probit analysis of credit union numbers yields the intuitive result that credit unions possess little market power (even in rural markets where they might be expected to play a significant role), and what little there is can likely be eliminated by a third credit union in the market. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.},

The four levels consisted of four seasons, seven prefectures within the Japanese archipelago, two agricultural cooperatives, and two farmers. The moisture, total sugar, and α- and β-carotene contents of the carrots were determined, and the results were evaluated using a random effects model. Based on the average of the four seasonal collections, 24% of the total variation in carrot composition was found to be attributable to seasonal change, 46% to region, 24% to farmer, and 6% to individual samples.

There are both formal and informal dimensions to the contracts that link the stakeholders in agricultural cooperatives. Jacques develops a model which includes three farmers and a CEO. The farmers can produce either high or low quality products. The production of different qualities depends on several variables, some of which are both observable and contractible. The cooperative's revenues depend on the production of the farmers and also on the actions of the CEO, which fall under the same categories. The contracts must ensure that a majority of the farmers are willing to enforce their terms as the members control the decisions. Farmers can leave the cooperative, which implies that they can spend resources improving their outside opportunities or participating in the management of the cooperative.},

The farm owner no longer pays daily wages to the workers but negotiates on compensation for the completion of certain tasks.

    abstract = {In recent years, the wind power sector has begun to move offshore, i.e. to use space and good wind speeds on the open sea for large scale electricity generation. Offshore wind power, however, is not just technologically challenging but also a capital intensive and risky business that requires particular financial and organizational resources not all potential investors might have. We therefore address the question, what impact offshore wind power may have on ownership and organizational structures in the wind power sector. We compare on- and offshore wind park ownership in Denmark, the UK and Germany. The analysis shows that offshore wind power in all three countries is dominated by large firms, many of which are from the electricity sector. In Denmark and the UK, also investors from the gas and oil industry play an important role in the offshore wind business. This development represents a major shift for countries such as Germany and Denmark, in which the wind power sector has grown and matured on the basis of investments by individuals, farmers, cooperatives and independent project developers. The structural changes by which offshore wind power is accompanied have consequences for turbine manufacturers, project developers, investors, associations and policy makers in the field. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {This paper evaluates the impact of institutional and governance factors on the performance of 10 smallholder agricultural cooperatives in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and market poultry, one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa's new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equitysharing partnerships.},

Others, however, have been able to maintain or even improve on previous levels of success. Individual farmers have also established new cooperatives and are working toward deepening cooperation. The paper discusses the importance of leadership of cooperatives during transition, a topic which is not well addressed in the literature. Production cooperatives are not only economic units, but also social networks. Two successful cooperatives in the same town, one old and one new, have been compared with respect to their social capital, development and leadership. The findings show that, in the traditional agricultural cooperative, a more social oriented leadership has helped to overcome economic, social, and psychological barriers arising during transition, while, in the case of the new co-op, improving cooperation has depended mainly on the increased level of social capital after the radical reforms.},

    abstract = {Integration of biodiversity conservation into economic utilization of natural resources has become a central response to the challenges of sustainable development. However, the resources and competencies required to implement such an integrated strategy at the level of the individual, the organization, and the sector are not known. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed an approach to analyze responses of organizations to environmental change and evolving social demands for biodiversity conservation. We analyze the scale, scope, and distribution of the resources and competencies that support the delineation of ecologically significant habitats in intensively managed nonindustrial private forests in Finland, an important international actor in the sector. Based on a national survey of 311 foresters working in public agencies, private firms, and cooperative organizations, we investigate the division of labor in the sector and the patterns of investment in human capital, organizational resources, and information networks that support delineation. We find that communicating frequently with the actors who are directly engaged in field operations is consistently the most productive resource in conserving habitats. Our analysis identifies differences in competencies among different types of organizations, as well as distinct roles for public and private-sector organizations. Beyond identification of differences in conservation behavior and competencies among organizations, our analysis points to substantial uniformity in the sector. We attribute similarities in patterns of investment in conservation resources to historically structured central coordination mechanisms within the sector that include education, training, and broadly shared professional norms. These institutional structures and the resulting uniformity can be potential impediments to radical innovation. Our approach to analyzing adaptation to environmental change highlights the interplay between investments in competencies by actors within a particular technical domain and the evolving external institutional environment. © 2009 by the author(s).},

We nest a cross-sectional time-series panel model within the risk-adjusted earnings principles of Ohlson (1995), and apply the model to a dataset of NSW credit unions during a period of regulatory intervention that abruptly required management to meet minimum capital thresholds. Because they cannot issue equity, and other income increasing options conflicted with credit union philosophy, this provided a strong incentive to use MCE as an option to rapidly increase revenue (and capital). We find MCE was financially ineffective in small credit unions, had a positive marketing leverage impact in large credit unions, and required regular renewal. Our study makes several contributions by: (i) disaggregating and testing the financial impact of marketing; (ii) applying a risk-adjusted model generally applicable to non-listed firms; (iii) informing on the capitalisation/expensing debate; (iv) highlighting when and why MCE as a real option is financially (in)effective; and, (v) adding to the growing interface in the financial/marketing literature. © 2008, SAGE Publications.

    abstract = {Credit unions are financial co-operatives that conduct their business for their members. The principal purpose of a credit union is to receive deposits from and make loans to members. They do not serve the general public. Membership is restricted by a qualification that is referred to as a common bond or field of membership. The origins of credit unions are to be found at the heart of the Industrial Revolution, when Robert Owen established two famous co-operatives in Rochdale and New Lanark. The most prominent co-operative influenced by his ideas, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, opened their famous co-operative shop on Toad Lane in 1844. This was an important step in the social and political change that was taking place throughout Europe and of which the people of Rochdale can justifiably claim to be leaders. By 1848, the Co-operative had 140 members and the society's membership increased to 390, by 1880 the national membership of consumer societies had reached over 500 000, and by the turn of the century it had reached 1.5 million. The members of the two co-operatives subscribed to shares and paid small amounts to raise sufficient funds in order to purchase goods below the market value and then resell them to the members at a savings. These co-operatives were the result of the growing complexities of modern economic life for both farmers and workers. Importantly, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers developed a number of principles that have assisted the development of credit unions. These principles were open membership, the democratic control of the organisation, a limited interest on share capital and the return on member's interests being in proportion to the member's patronage. These principles illustrate why credit unions are a unique financial co-operative. Under the guidance of the World Council of Credit Unions, the growth of credit unions has been remarkable. In 2007, there were 49 000 credit unions and 177 000 000 members in 96 countries. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it aims to illustrate how credit unions are able to grow in times of economic hardship- a situation that is demonstrated by examining the impact of the Great Depression in the United States of America (USA) and the Credit Crunch in the United Kingdom (UK). Second, the article highlights the importance of deposit protection schemes when credit unions face financial difficulties in the USA, UK and the Republic of Ireland (Ireland). © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

    abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that although reconciliation between livelihood improvement and biodiversity conservation for sustainable development is complex and difficult, it is feasible to attain such a goal. One such experiment was carried out in southeast Brazil to protect mangroves and livelihood enhancement through the development of an oyster producers' cooperative. By employing a mix of qualitative research methods, including a variety of Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques, we found that institutional initiative for innovative oyster-rearing techniques and the development of the local-level organization were crucial for reconciliation of income enhancement with conservation. The examination of how development and innovation interventions can lead to sustainable development has revealed that the state of "capabilities" and their expansion is at the core of sustainable livelihood opportunities and ecological systems. The Cananeia Cooperative experiment evidently supports these assertions.},

Many groups, however, were disbanded within the first few years after the legislation came into effect. In many cases group members expected different forms of subsidies and less complicated application procedures. The provision of adequate information for farmers and the training of civil servants who would be able to assist them in interpreting the law could have increased the utilisation of support. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

    abstract = {In dyadic channel partnerships, specific outcomes and behaviours are often emphasised to signal desirable objectives and actions that would lead to adequate levels of coordination. Much of the research regarding the outcome- and behaviour-based controls has adopted the perspective of the firm that manages the relationship (source). However, questions remain as to how, or even whether, the managed firm (target) benefits from these coordination efforts. Drawing on the most recent literature on channel governance, this research posits that both the target's trust in, and dependence on, the source moderate the effects of outcome- and behaviour-control on the target's performance. Formal hypotheses are tested on a sample of 157 agricultural cooperatives involved in channel partnership with larger, downstream second-order marketing cooperatives. The results indicate that the target's trust in the source enhances the positive effects of both types of controls. However, the target's dependence on the source decreases the positive effects of behaviour-based controls on the target's performance. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {Purpose - In recent years, the focus of the Chinese Government has deviated from economic growth to overall societal balance and harmony. One of the major policy adjustments is to strengthen the supply of public goods in rural areas and set up the rural cooperative medical system (RCMS) financed by both governments and farmers. The purpose of this paper is to outline the background, recent developments, achievements and problems of the RCMS and help people to understand the RCMS in China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a time approach, meaning the paper is organized by initiate background, system framework design, experiment and extension, achievement, problems and discussion about the RCMS development process. Findings - The Central Government intended to establish a new medical system in rural areas, so that farmers could protect themselves if they got sick. The paper finds that, with the help of the government, farmers have gradually accepted the medical cooperation system. The RCMS has rapidly been extended, and forms a basic medical security net for rural residents. The RCMS has achieved the initial goals of the policy reform: mitigating farmers' financial burden, increasing the number of visits to doctors, and reducing the cost of the RCMS. However, there are still some pending issues such as fund-raising, monitoring-efficiency, and medical targets that need to be solved. Originality/value - This paper is a general review, which provides a brief and general image of the Chinese RCMS and helps people to understand the RCMS in China. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Facing this situation, from the end of the nineteenth century they promoted important efforts for social mobilisation and tried to obtain control of the peasantry through agrarian cooperatives and other associations. Nevertheless, as a consequence of the increasing struggle with the peasantry, landowners changed their strategy, and in the 1930s concentrated their collective action on the defence of property.

Accordingly, the aim of this article is to illustrate an organisation mode that might ensure the efficient running of self-managed firms. The author offers arguments in support of his contention that well-organised cooperative firms do not come in for most of the criticisms levelled against them in today's economic literature.

    abstract = {Water is a major constituent of almost all animal and vegetable tissues as well as crystals of many minerals. An adequate supply of wholesome water is the foundation of health for any community. Today due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, the water bodies are being increasingly contaminated by various toxic pollutants. The processes in a textile mill require large volumes of water all of which are released later as effluent. One major group of contaminants in this effluent is dyestuffs which makes it aesthetically unacceptable and also toxic depending on the chemicals. The present study has been undertaken to assess the impact of effluents released by the APOL (Assam Polyester Co-operative Society Limited), textile mill Rangia in the district of Kamrup, Assam on the quality of drinking water in the neighbouring areas. The mill, established in an area of 38.02 acre of prime agricultural land, started functioning frorn November 1988. The effluent of the mill is discharged into the agricultural land on the western side of the mill. There is a historical earthen dam from the boundary wall of the mill along western direction at a distance of about 125 m. This dam divides the area into two parts, one between the mill and the dam and the other between the dam and the surroundings. Water samples from drinking water sources used by the households in the surroundings of the mill are taken up for monitoring and analysis in this work. Surface water samples from the nearby agricultural land are also collected and analysed. Concentrations of cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K), anions (CI, N03, S0 4, P04, F) and heavy metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) reveal that effluent discharge from the mill is having some impact on the quality of drinking water and surface water of the locality. © 2009-Kalpana Corporation.},

    abstract = {The Decree 46 of 1992 created the National Board for Community Banks which was granted the power to license community banks. Community banks were created to: (1) promote rural development through provision of banking and financial services, (2) enhance rural productive activities, and (3) improve economic status of small-scale producers in rural and urban areas. According to Marx (2004), Nigeria has a dynamic informal financial sector. A key to growth strategy is to assist the development of this informal sector. The recent government policy to rid the economy of community banks defeats the original purpose underlying the creation of community banks. In view of the important role of community banks in Nigeria, the authors propose that community banks should continue to be rural financial institutions with specialized methods to serve broad segments of the rural population. The National Board for Community Banks should be vested with power to license, monitor and regulate community banks, and the regulatory power of the Central Bank of Nigeria over community banks should not go beyond that necessary for the performance of its monetary policy function. Furthermore, a partnership should be formed between the National Board for Community Banks, National Association of Community Banks and the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank for the purpose of funding rural ventures through loan syndication. The Bankers' Committee initiative for small and medium enterprises funding should be channeled through the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank.},

    abstract = {The purpose of this study was to detect significant SNPs for carcass quality traits using DNA chips of high SNP density in Hanwoo populations. Carcass data of two hundred and eighty nine steers sired by 30 Korean proven sires were collected from two regions; the Hanwoo Improvement Center of National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in Seosan, Chungnam province and the commercial farms in Gyeongbuk province. The steers in Seosan were born between spring and fall of 2006 and those in Gyeonbuk between falls of 2004 and 2005. The former steers were slaughtered at approximately 24 months, while the latter steers were fed six months longer before slaughter. Among the 55,074 SNPs in the Illumina bovine 50K chip, a total of 32,756 available SNPs were selected for whole genome association study. After adjusting for the effects of sire, region and slaughter age, phenotypes were regressed on each SNP using a simple linear regression model. For the significance threshold, 0.1% point-wise p value from F distribution was used for each SNP test. Among the significant SNPs for a trait, the best set of SNP markers were selected using a stepwise regression procedure, and inclusion and exclusion of each SNP out of the model was determined at the p<0.001 level. A total of 118 SNPs were detected; 15, 20, 22, 28, 20, and 13 SNPs for final weight before slaughter, carcass weight, backfat thickness, weight index, longissimus dorsi muscle area, and marbling score, respectively. Among the significant SNPs, the best set of 44 SNPs was determined by stepwise regression procedures with 7, 9, 6, 9, 7, and 6 SNPs for the respective traits. Each set of SNPs per trait explained 20-40% of phenotypic variance. The number of detected SNPs per trait was not great in whole genome association tests, suggesting additional phenotype and genotype data are required to get more power to detect the trait-related SNPs with high accuracy for estimation of the SNP effect. These SNP markers could be applied to commercial Hanwoo populations via marker-assisted selection to verify the SNP effects and to improve genetic potentials in successive generations of the Hanwoo populations.},

    abstract = {Municipal solid waste management (SWM) problems present a serious challenge to local government authorities (LGAs) in developing countries. The effective way to reduce this tremendous issue is to integreate waste recycling systems into existing and future SWM. Understanding factors influencing recycling performance is the key to achieving sustainable waste management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the performance of SWM relating to solid waste recycling covering a total of 120 solid waste recycling programs located in different urban areas of Thailand. The indicators involving efficiency, effectiveness and service ratio were used for the assessment of recycling performance using statistical analysis methods. Influencing factors encompassing technical, economic and financial, and institutional aspects were identified for three types of recycling programs (school garbage bank, community garbage bank, and composting facility). The results suggest that common significant factors are perception of administrator awareness of SWM problems, and source separation. In terms of school garbage banks, the provision of monetary incentive including interest and compensatory goods for recycling members, transportation cost, and low investment costs significantly affect the performance. Provision of loans, managing the program as a cooperative organization, and provision of door-to-door service correlate with better performance by community garbage banks. For composting facilities, provision of free organic waste bins and cooperation with NGOs correlate with a higher rate of waste diversion. The findings also propose implications for enhancing the performance of recycling systems through a number of measures including provision of monetary incentive, tax incentives, subsidizations, information dissemination, awareness campaigns, training, technical assistance, staff exchanges, and networking with voluntary organizations-which should be formulated with respect to building capacity of development partners, responding to poor recycling performance, and focusing on significant influencing factors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

    abstract = {1. In cooperative societies with high reproductive skew, selection on females is likely to operate principally through variation in the probability of acquiring dominant status and variation in reproductive success while dominant. Despite this, few studies of cooperative societies have investigated the factors that influence which females become dominant, and/or their reproductive output while in the dominant position. 2. Here we use long-term data from a wild meerkat population to describe variation in the breeding success of dominant female meerkats Suricata suricatta and investigate its causes. 3. Female meerkats compete intensely for breeding positions, and the probability of acquiring the breeding role depends upon a female's age in relation to competitors and her weight, both at the time of dominance acquisition and early in life. 4. Once dominant, individual differences in breeding success depend principally on the duration of dominance tenure. Females remain for longer in the dominant position if they are heavier than their competitors at the start of dominance, and if the number of adult female competitors at the start is low. 5. Female breeding success is also affected by variation in fecundity and pup survival, both of which increase with group size. After controlling for these effects, female body weight has a positive influence on breeding rate and litter size, while the number of adult female competitors reduces litter survival. 6. These findings suggest that selection for body weight and competitive ability will be high in female meerkats, which may moderate their investment in cooperative activities. We suggest that similar consequences of competition may occur among females in other cooperative societies where the benefits of attaining dominance status are high. © 2007 The Authors.},

To research farmers' demand for rural financial services a representative household survey was conducted early 2008 in the region of Shida Kartli (N=406). The survey included a choice experiment to investigate farmer's preferences for characteristics of particular credit schemes. Results show that segments of the farmer population differ in their preferences for loan attributes. Furthermore, farmers expressed a very high demand for small credits with individual liability, and one third of them have experience with loans. These findings provide useful information for future credit cooperatives. Barriers to implementation are lack of trust among farmers and misconception of cooperatives with the former Soviet kolkhozes. Information campaigns can therefore be a key ingredient for the successful establishment of credit cooperatives.},

    abstract = {Approaches to manage for the sustainable use of natural and cultural resources in a landscape can have many different designs. One design is adaptive collaborative landscape management (ACLM) where research providers and users work closely together on projects to develop resources while adaptively managing to sustain or maintain landscapes in the long term. We propose that collaborative projects are more useful for achieving outcomes than integrative projects where participants merely join their separate contributions. To foster collaborative research projects to adaptively manage landscapes in northern Australia, a Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre (TSCRC) was established in 1995. The TSCRC is a joint venture of major organizations involved in research and land management. This paper is our perspective on the four most important 'lessons learned' after using a ACLM-type approach for over 10 y. We learnt that collaboration (working in combination) not necessarily integration (combining parts into a whole) achieved sustainable outcomes. We found that integration across culturally diverse perspectives seldom achieved sustainable solutions because it devalued the position of the less empowered participants. In addition, positive outcomes were achieved when participants developed trust and respect for each other by embracing and respecting their differences and by sharing unifying concepts such as savanna health. Another lesson learned was that a collaborative organization must act as an honest broker by resisting advocacy of one view point over another. Finally, we recognized the importance of strongly investing in communication and networking so that people could adaptively learn from one another's experiences, understand each other's challenges and respect each other's choices. Our experience confirms the usefulness of the ACLM approach and highlights its role in the process of sustaining healthy landscapes. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the new regulatory framework and its impact on the continued poor perception of credit unions among users of financial services products. It also aims to assess what the future may hold for the direction of the UK credit union sector. Design/methodology/approach – An assessment is made of the impact of the new regulatory framework and its impact on the continued poor perception of credit unions among users of financial services products. Also, an assessment is made of what the future may hold for the direction of the UK credit union sector. Findings – The paper finds that credit union membership is growing, as are members’ deposits and loans, however at the same time the numbers of individual credit unions are falling. Overall, with supervision and regulation passing to the FSA, the outlook for credit unions in the UK is better than at any time in their history. The result of the new regime will ultimately lead to a strong, secure and professional credit union sector, capable of meeting the credit needs of a wide range of persons. Originality/value – The paper provides a useful overview of the history and present status of UK credit unions, and the effects of recent legislation and regulation. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

    abstract = {1. Subordinate helpers in cooperative societies may gain both immediate and future benefits, including paternity and territorial inheritance. However, if such opportunities correlate with rank in the queue, it is unclear why such queues should be stable. 2. In cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus, only males are generally philopatric, and form stable hierarchical queues for the dominant position. 3. Male opportunities for reproduction are influenced both by their dominance status within the group, and their relatedness to the breeding female. For young queuing subordinates, the breeding female is typically their mother. Because of incest avoidance, reproduction is possible only through extra-group mating, even if the dominant position is achieved while the mother is still on the territory. If the mother dies while the helper is still a subordinate, he can seek matings both outside the group, and with the unrelated replacement female within the group. Finally, males can achieve the dominant position and pair with an unrelated female by inheritance, dispersal to a neighbouring vacancy, or by forming a liaison with an immigrant subordinate female that causes fission of the natal territory. 4. On average males spent more time living with unrelated females than with their mother. Subordinate males gained no survival advantages when living with their mother rather than an unrelated female, contrary to the prediction that parents facilitate the survival of their offspring. 5. Dominants and subordinates also had similar survival. Mortality accelerated over time, probably because older males invest more in extra-group courtship display. 6. Fairy-wren queues are likely to be stable because older birds are superior, and because extra-pair mating provides direct benefits to subordinates. © 2007 The Author.},

    abstract = {The 'benefits of philopatry' hypothesis states that helpers in cooperatively breeding species derive higher benefits from remaining home, instead of dispersing and attempting to breed independently. We tested experimentally whether dispersal options influence dispersal propensity in the cooperatively breeding Lake Tanganyika cichlids Neolamprologus pulcher and N. savoryi. Cooperative groups of these fishes breed in densely packed colonies, surrounded by unoccupied, but apparently suitable breeding habitat. Breeding inside colonies and living in groups seems to benefit individuals, for example by early detection and deterrence of predators. We show that despite a slight preference of both species for habitat with a higher stone cover, 40% of the preferred habitat remained unoccupied. On average, the colonies contained a higher number of (1) predators of adults, juveniles and eggs, (2) shelter competitors, and (3) other species including potential food competitors, compared to the outside colony habitat. Apparently, habitat differences cannot explain why these cichlids breed in colonies. Accordingly, dispersal may not be limited by a lack of suitable breeding shelters, but by the relatively higher risk of establishing an outside- compared to a within-colony breeding territory. To test whether cichlids prefer within- to outside-colony breeding territories, we provided breeding shelters inside the colony and at the colony edge and studied helper dispersal. As expected, significantly more shelters were occupied within the colony compared to the edge. New breeding pairs with several helpers occupied these shelters. We conclude that although breeding habitat is plentiful outside the colonies, helpers delay dispersal to obtain a higher quality breeding position within the group or colony eventually, or they disperse in groups. Our results suggest that (1) group augmentation and Allee effects are generally important for dispersal decisions in cooperatively breeding cichlids, consistent with the 'benefits of philopatry hypothesis', and (2) habitat saturation cannot fully explain delayed dispersal in these species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The author's conclusions are based upon an analysis of the amendments to the Credit Unions Act 1979 introduced by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). As a result, the 1979 Act now reciprocates the controversial, yet flexible United States (US) legislative framework. In particular, the article examines the interpretation of the common bond, the provision of financial services and the regulation of credit unions. The article concludes that these three statutory provisions have assisted the growth of credit unions in both countries and not limited their development. However, the growth of credit unions has come, at the expense of their unique status and philosophy. It has made US credit unions, in particular, indistinguishable from banks. This is a problem which may affect credit unions in the UK.

    abstract = {Among all sectors in the Philippine agricultural economy, livestock exhibited the fastest and most consistent growth (4.6 percent on average per year) in the 1990s and well into the twenty-first century, steadily increasing its share of contribution to gross value added in agriculture from 18 percent in 1990 to 24 percent by 2003. The expansion of the industry has been propelled mainly by growth in domestic demand for meat in general, and for pork in particular, fueled by a still-rapid population growth, increased urbanization, and modest improvements in per capita income, particularly in the national capital and in major urban centers in the provinces around the Metropolitan Manila area. Pig production is the largest contributor to meat output in the Philippines. It is also an economic activity in which smallholders still dominate, accounting for close to 80 percent of total pig inventories. The strong growth in demand for pork presents a potential for increasing income opportunities, and therefore for poverty alleviation among rural and agricultural households in the Philippines, where rural poverty incidence for families remains high at 40.3 percent. In the two major hog-producing regions of Southern and Central Luzon adjacent to the national capital, however, the observed trends depict a more rapid decline in the share of smallholder pig producers in regional output, such that by 2003, smallholders held the minority share. In these two regions, although the number of registered commercial pig farms significantly increased, the number of farms raising pigs declined between the 1990s and 2000s. These numbers suggest a scaling up of larger farms and a displacement of smaller ones. The more rapid growth in larger commercial farms is not solely premised on the existence of economies of scale in production but is attributed, in large part, to the commercial sector being able to escape or at least overcome transaction costs that cannot be handled as easily by small producers. In addition, the cost advantage of large farms over small ones is also hypothesized to stem from their ability to access privileged prices of crucial inputs that are linked to policy subsidies. On the demand side of the meat industry, consuming households in the metropolis and in the major urbanizing centers in the two regions, with their higher incomes and purchasing power, are not only increasing their consumption of meat but also their demand for quality, convenience, and greater product differentiation. On the supply side, large meat products companies are vertically integrating pig-production operations; exercising control over their own breeding farms, feed formulation, and animal health services; and establishing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point-compatible slaughtering and processing plants. They are also producing differentiated meat cuts and meat products, packaging them in convenient forms, and establishing their own brands. In the regulatory scene, the government's National Meat Inspection Service is strengthening monitoring, inspection, and grading functions on the sanitary conditions of all slaughterhouses, public and private, for local, national, and international trade in meat. These changing market forces, compounded by structural factors and the policy environment, pose a serious challenge to the continued survival of smallholder pig producers. The poverty implications of the displacement of smallholders in the market raise important social questions. This report attempts to respond to these questions by investigating empirical evidence about the scale and access issues that affect smallholders. The study employs two methods to quantify the contributions of market forces and policies affecting the scale of livestock-production operations. Then it relates each contribution to measures that can be taken to overcome transaction cost barriers and policy distortions faced by smallholders that tend to ease them out of mainstream markets for their output and consign them to marginal ones. Chapter 1 provides the background of the study, states the objectives, and lays down the scale issues related to competitiveness in markets for livestock that are to be investigated. The chapter breaks down the objectives into three main questions on: (1) whether small pig-producing farms can compete with large farms; (2) the role of transaction cost barriers in smallholder participation and performance in hog production; and (3) redressing transaction cost barriers if these barriers affect small and large farms differentially. Chapter 2 lays out the two approaches that the study uses in investigating the role of transaction costs in economic activities. The first is a direct approach through a market participation model. The second is an indirect approach through the estimation of an efficiency model. A brief review of the literature on these approaches is provided. The market participation model assesses the roles of household characteristics and factors outside the household in determining participation in pig production and the level of market participation. The profit-efficiency model assesses farm-level differences in efficiency in generating profits from a given level of resources, input and output prices in terms of differences in transaction costs, and policy subsidies across the scale of operations studied (from small, backyard-level to medium-scale farms). Chapter 3 focuses on the determinants of participation by households in the economic activity of pig production. It begins by providing a brief description of the Southern Tagalog region and the subregion consisting of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon provinces (CALABARZON), where the study was undertaken. The investigation draws on field data collected in 2000-2001 from three cities in the two major pig-producing provinces in the region. Household-level data were obtained from a sample of 144 pig-producing households and 141 households not producing livestock, randomly picked from identified pig-producing villages. A probit market-participation model was estimated and results were analyzed to explain why some households engage in pig production whereas others do not. Among the significant factors that influenced the decision of households to participate in pig production were the availability of household resources, particularly family labor, and the opportunity costs of the household head and spouse in engaging in pig production, a labor-intensive economic activity. Households with more members of working age tended to participate, whereas those with household heads or spouses that were government or private sector employees tended not to be engaged in pig production. The decision to participate was also influenced by the capacity of the households to deal with fixed transaction costs related to access to financial resources for engaging in the activity and to negotiations involved in a market-oriented activity. The results of the Heckman two-step selection model reveal that the price of slaughter hogs and the access to market outlets that are not limited to the confines of the village are significant factors that influenced the household's level of participation in pig production. Chapter 4 focuses on the pig-producing households, further disaggregated into independent and contract producers. The chapter compares independent and contract farms in terms of the types of production activities engaged in and access to information and credit, feeds and growing or breeding stock, animal health services, and markets for inputs and outputs. Most contract growers tended to specialize in fattening pigs to slaughter hogs. In contrast, independent producers tended to combine the production of weaners (piglets) with slaughter hogs or specialized in weaner piglet production. Both independent and contract producers were highly market oriented, although in varying intensities, from purchasing mixed feeds and growing or breeding stock, to selling output to various outlets. Smallholders were grouped into size quintiles according to the level of their annualized outputs. The levels of activity covered a wide range. Those belonging to the lowest quintile produced very small volumes of output (averaging 315 kilograms per year). Mean output was equivalent to approximately five slaughter hogs per year, or about 20 piglets per year, in one or two batches. Producers in the third quintile produced about six times as much as the first, whereas those in the last quintile produced about 200 slaughter hogs per year, 40 times more than the average production per farm of the first quintile. In general, contract growers in the sample operated at significantly higher levels of activity than did independents, with the majority of them falling in the fourth and fifth size quintiles. Even so, they are still rightfully classified as smallholder producers engaged in a nonformal enterprise, having very similar household characteristics to the independent smallholder sample except for the number of animals kept. The two groups mainly use unpaid household labor (rarely employing hired labor) and have similar nonlivestock sector resources. Contract growers exhibited better access to quality feeds and stock, feed credit, veterinary health services, and credit for expansion purposes. Contract growers also had better access to markets for slaughter hogs, even if their location relative to that of independent producers was at a greater distance from Metropolitan Manila, the main market for live hogs. The advantage of contract growers in the market relative to independents can be traced to the former's integration into a formal institution - a feedmilling and multipurpose cooperative - for the production and marketing of their output.},

    abstract = {This study investigates the employment of vinegrowers on a Greek island (Samos) where there exist attractive alternative employment opportunities, particularly in the tourist sector. The recent dramatic decline in the number of vinegrowers has been of great concern particularly to wine producers, policy makers, and local authorities because such a pattern has had, and most importantly will have, serious economic, social, and environmental implications. The focus of this paper is on two issues. First, some descriptive statistics on the demographics of vinegrowers and characteristics of vineyards are presented and second, a probit model is developed to identify the demographic and other determinants of the probability of off-farm and off-vineyard work participation. The most important source of data information is primary data collected by the authors, using a questionnaire, which was completed by a representative sample of vinegrowers from the island of Samos. The empirical findings suggest that the promotion of vinegrowing requires policies that will enlarge the size of vineyards, promote investments in human and physical capital, and improve the public infrastructure.},

    abstract = {Gathering the harvest represents a complex managerial problem for agricultural cooperatives involved in harvesting and processing operations: balancing the risk of overinvestment with the risk of underproduction. The rate to harvest crops and the corresponding capital investment are critical strategic decisions in situations where poor weather conditions present a risk of crop loss. In this article, we discuss a case study of the Concord grape harvest and develop a mathematical model to control harvest risk. The model involves differentiation of a joint probability distribution that represents risks associated with the length of the harvest season and the size of the crop. This approach is becoming popular as a means of dealing with complex problems involving operational and supply chain risk. Significant cost avoidance, in the millions of dollars, results from practical implementation of the Harvest Model. Using real data, we found that the Harvest Model provides lower-cost solutions in situations involving moderate variability in both the length of season and the crop size as compared to solutions based on imposed risk policies determined by management. © 2004 INFORMS.},

Design/methodology/approach - The research approach is empirical and descriptive. Data were gathered by mail survey from Finnish software producers. Findings - Networked firms intended to improve profitability by boosting resource efficiency, while non-networked firms concentrated on price increases. No difference occurred in firms' perceptions of their profitability. Networked firms intended to grow by mergers and acquisitions and by cooperation with partners. Non-networked firms were eager to grow by developing new software products. Networked firms intended to increase information sharing more and were more open in sharing information concerning firms' technical competencies, cost, and commitments to other organizations. Lack of marketing resources was the most important reason for firms to join a network. Research limitations/implications - The research setting (how the firms are classified in groups, for example) could benefit from deeper analysis of how network characteristics are connected and which variables best estimate and describe the degree of networking of a firm. A larger sample of firms should be covered to achieve generalizable results. Systematic comparison of industries would also provide essential information on network dynamics. Originality/value - Networked firms had grown more than non-networked firms but no connection between profitability perceptions and networking was obtained. In software industry, growth may produce networks but networking seems to support growth. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Yet such initiatives are also regulatory mechanisms that establish voluntary alternative arrangements for governing production, commercialization and consumption of global commodities. Based on a recent study of fair trade coffee experiences in Latin America, this paper explores the changes that fair trade represents in governance of the coffee commodity chain. It argues that fair trade coffee governance is shaped both by formal organizational arrangements for coordination and control and, less formally, by the social and political relations embedded in fair trade's commodity chain. Fair trade's alternative governance arrangements represent one of the initiative's major accomplishments but also pose some of its most significant challenges for the future.

    abstract = {The Massachusetts Woodlands Cooperative, LLC (MWC) is working to help members conduct sustainable forestry of the highest standards while increasing financial returns from harvest activities. The forests of Massachusetts, the third most densely populated state in the United States, are threatened. Decades of high grading and the threat of forest conversion to alternative use present challenges for maintaining a forested landscape. Despite being 60% forested, Massachusetts imports approximately 98% of the wood fiber that its citizens consume. The Massachusetts Woodlands Cooperative is a forest management, processing, and marketing cooperative organized by and on behalf of forest landowners in western Massachusetts. An umbrella group certification protocol was developed to provide cost-effective forestland management certification. Members benefit from cooperative management of harvest operations, above-market stumpage payments, and value-added processing and production including marketing traditionally low-value and small-diameter material. The added revenue from developing these new markets is used to fund timber, wildlife habitat, recreation, and other sustainable forest management activities. The cooperative works in partnership with local wood-processing businesses to spur community economic development. This study on cooperatives may be a successful example of sustainable forest management that can be applied in other regions with private land ownerships. © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Utilizing the logic of the property rights theory of the firm, the paper develops an alternative continuum for cooperative, hierarchical, and market organization. These governance mechanisms are shown to exhibit growing difference in the extensiveness of property rights assigned to the involved contractual parties. This continuum does not imply the hybridity of cooperatives; rather, it locates hierarchy between market and cooperative organization. The empirical validity of die new continuum is confirmed by the results of a survey of members of several Ukrainian rural cooperatives.},

When compared to capital-controlled firms, the agency problems become more complex and harder to solve in the cooperative framework. As empirical evidence of this problem and its corresponding solution, we illustrate the case of the Mondragón cooperatives, explaining in detail the incentive system and the control mechanisms now in place in this successful business group. The study of the governance architecture of Mondragón may help us to propose solutions to traditional problems of the cooperative firm and to reach a better understanding of both the governance of cooperatives and corporate governance in general. © 2006 M.E.

As agriculture in this region has become increasingly intensive and specialized, land managers have tended to ignore the role of the landscape in providing goods and services such as water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. However, many farmers and ranchers claim that they would welcome an opportunity to protect ecosystem health while general consumer behaviour has indicated that they are willing to pay a premium to encourage such efforts. This article has two main objectives. First, it provides an overview of the main institutional approaches that have been developed to encourage natural ecosystem conservation and environmental and economic sustainability in the prairie landscape. Second, the discussion then centres on the role and potential of an alternative institutional approach, namely, a strategic consumer-producer cooperative. In this discussion we highlight the appropriateness, advantages, and disadvantages of consumer-producer cooperatives in altering agricultural management to enhance the ecological, economic, and social sustainability of the prairie landscape. The article will provide examples from a consumer-producer cooperative that is under development in southern Saskatchewan.},

    abstract = {This article examines the Labour party's attitude towards the wholesaling industry. During the inter-war period wholesalers, 'middlemen' as they were commonly called, occupied the position of bogeyman in much Labour party thinking and literature. As a result the Labour governments of the 1920s took actions designed to achieve two ends: to improve the efficiency of food distribution, and to limit the power of middlemen to exploit both ends of the food production chain, farmers and consumers alike. This ideological positioning of the middleman by Labour, and the reforms introduced under the MacDonald governments, stressed the need to establish farmers' co-operatives and consumers' protection agencies, and also emphasized the importance of other measures designed to boost efficiency. However, by the time of the Attlee governments the cornerstone of the inter-war policy, the producer co-operative, had been abandoned and the focus of debate shifted to various forms of nationalization. This change of policy is examined in this article. Though post-war Labour manifestos pledged to nationalize sections of the wholesaling industry, and despite the fact that the party under Attlee discussed the nationalization of wholesaling at length, the industry remained in private hands. An attempt to understand how and why the nationalization of wholesaling was opposed within the party and shelved by the Attlee governments is central to this study. © 2007 Oxford University Press.

The results exposed the limitations of efficiency presented by credit cooperatives and verified that they under utilized the productive resources.

    abstract = {Innovations in farm enterprise organization provide important opportunities for sustainable rural livelihoods and enhanced quality of life. However, field research in Saskatchewan suggests that existing cooperative models of multi-family farming do not necessarily provide a context for full and equitable participation by women. This comparative, feminist research reveals that women from cooperative group farms are generally as marginalized as their counterparts on conventional family farms. What women do, how they see themselves, and how others see them, reflect a dynamic and complex interplay among the social relations of production, reproduction, and consumption. Farm business organization is only one parameter in the context of patriarchal kin, community, and commercial relations. Thus, changing farm organizational structure alone is not sufficient to overcome structural, social, and cultural inequities in the rural landscape.},

It is argued that the credit union industry faces an inherent demutualisation bias which emerges as the sector develops maturity. Contributing factors include the emergence of professional management pursuing personal objectives, together with the economic realities of technological change, financial liberalisation, increased competition, and prudential regulation based on minimum capital requirements. Demutualisation incentives may partially reflect the unsuitability of the mutual form of governance in larger, more sophisticated financial institutions, but there is also a significant risk of demutualisation based on wealth expropriation motives. Alternative policies and strategies which might avoid this demutualisation bias are examined. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2005.},

It is based on research into Dutch EC, which have about 10,000 members, of which a quarter are non-farmers. The paper details the benefits EC have delivered to their members, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, the environment and the rural economy using evidence drawn from interviews with farmer and non-farmer members, farmer non-members, policy makers and academics connected with seven EC. It pays particular attention to the benefits and disadvantages of allowing non-farmer membership. It is argued that EC would be a valuable additional instrument to help deliver landscape-scale environmental, regional and rural policy objectives. However, Dutch EC have received important political and, particularly in their start-up stage, financial support, and similar support would be needed in the UK-it is argued this may be more readily available if UK EC will offer non-farmer membership. Appropriate support could be provided through developments to the Environmental Stewardship Scheme's higher level tier, by safeguarding and extending the spirit of the LEADER plus programme (which explicitly supports collective action) to the delivery of environmental benefits, and/or by encouraging the development of locally based social enterprises. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {Purpose - To identify and describe work environment conditions that give rise to a shared or different state of the psychological contract for managers and employees. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews conducted with seven managers and 12 employees within an Australian credit union. Questions relate to the causes (work environment conditions) and content (salary, recognition and rewards, trust and fairness, open/honest communication) of the psychological contract. Comparative analysis techniques identify and contrast psychological contract categories of managers and employees. Findings - Although managers and employees shared similar responses as to the state of the psychological contract, they attributed different causes to these states. Managers tended to construct rational explanations and emphasise resource constraints and financial considerations, whilst employees constructed emotional explanations and attributed this situation to an unfair, uncaring or distant management. Employees regarded the Staff Consultative Committee and open-door policies as "symbolic acts" rather than genuine attempts to give employees a voice in the company. Practical implications - Aligning the psychological contract espoused by management more closely with that upheld by employees requires managers to adopt more personal, face-to-face communication strategies. The removal of status-related barriers to communication places managers in a better position to explain to employees how the organisation can meet (or not) specific contract expectations and obligations. Originality/value - Paper provides interesting insights into how contracts form within the context of work environment, HRM policy and practice, and cultural factors - work context factors largely ignored by psychological contract researchers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

    abstract = {Purpose-To argue a case for a paradigm shift in the way urban cooperative banks (UCBs) are managed, governed, and regulated in India to enable them to enhance their contributions to achieving greater degree of financial inclusion, and more broad-based growth. Design/methodology/approach-The paper first surveys the quantitative importance of the UCBs in India, and their key performance indicators. Various official reports by the country’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and other relevant organizations are used extensively. The paper then identifies key areas of reforms, centering primarily on the current business model, governance and regulation practices, and capital adequacy. It then argues for a change in a paradigm shift by the UCBs, and how better governance and regulatory structure can assist this shift. Findings-The paper finds that if the UCBs are to remain relevant and play a significant developmental role in India, they will require same quality of governance and regulation as well as professionalism and modernization as the mainstream commercial banks. The governance and regulatory structures need to be brought in conformity with India’s current and prospective economic structure; and relevant laws modernized. This requires a paradigm shift in the role of UCBs. Research limitations/implications-The research has been based primarily on secondary sources, particularly various reports by the RBI, the country’s Central Bank. Better understanding of the reasons for differences between well-governed and financially sound UCBs on one hand, and those that are not, requires focused interviews and more searching examination of the operating environment and financial statements of a sample of the UCBs. This could be the next stage of research. Originality/value-This paper represents a part of public debate on ways of integrating the UCBs into the mainstream banking sector. This is an important public policy issue as even though the UCBs represent relatively small proportion of the total banking assets, they still represent a systemic risk to India’s financial system, and without reforming them, broad-based economic growth would be difficult to achieve. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The study comprised 83 interviews, observations of meetings and extensive analysis of archival and contemporary written data. Analysis of the data revealed that the ejido's volatile organizational process led to the reproduction of a suboptimal process and a pessimistic organizational culture focused on the short term.

    abstract = {This study investigated poultry farmers' perceptions, preferences, and use of commercially compounded and self-compounded feeds in the Oyo Area of Oyo State, Nigeria. Data were collected from 120 poultry farmers through a structured interview schedule. The study concluded that poultry farmers prefer and use self-compounded feeds (SCF) instead of commercially compounded feeds (CCF) because (a) self-compounded feeds are of better quality than commercially compounded feeds, (b) there are no quality control measures in the poultry feed industry in the Oyo Area, (c) commercially compounded feeds cost more than self-compounded feeds, and (d) farmers choose feed based on the perceived quality of the feed, their technical ability to produce feed by themselves, the cost of CCF, the storability of feed, and the cost and availability of transportation. Based on these findings, it is recommended that interested public and private agencies should organize annual extension workshops and training for poultry farmers in the study area on (a) feed formulation; (b) feed ingredient mixing and compounding; (c) selection of ingredients, mixtures, and additives; and (d) the establishment, operation, and maintenance of feed mills. Farmers should be encouraged to form feed mill cooperative societies. The performance of the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) should be monitored and evaluated to ensure its effective oversight of quality standards for agricultural products and inputs such as feeds and feed ingredients. © Springer 2006.},

HIG adoption rates and associated fish production during 1997/1998 varied according to extension intensity across three farmer groups. Short training sessions were found to be equally effective at communicating HIG technology to farmers as longer on-farm trials. Both forms of extension were more effective than farmer-to-farmer communication at producing higher fish yields. Yields across all groups, however, were significantly lower than HIG-projected yields, suggesting that extension methodology did not exclusively affect production in this system. Farmer income, land holdings, attitudes, predisposition to risk, and fertilizer price all may have affected production. Improving production will involve a multifaceted approach, possibly including development of less capital-intense technologies, focus on short training sessions, encouragement of farmer cooperatives, and advocacy of economic policies that improve farmer access to credit and local markets.},

His detailed knowledge of the strategic structure of IDOA allowed him to choose a new equilibrium. His desire and ability to communicate with every level involved in the implementation of the CCP as well as his considerable autonomy from the governor enabled him to create, articulate, and implement the strategies necessary to change the equilibrium. And finally his reputation in the aging field served as a bond that allowed him to enforce the new agency equilibrium, thereby overcoming problems of renegotiation proofness.

These new generation cooperatives have played a particularly strong role in developing renewable energy and agricultural enterprises, especially in the face of proposed new crop rotations, inclusion of perennial crops in these rotations, and different management scenarios based on agro-forestry principles. In this paper, we define conditions under which the farm cooperative is an appropriate business enterprise structure, and review and update the status of four of these new generation cooperative business structures in Minnesota, New York, and Iowa. We assess the status of development of these cooperatives and the market conditions needed for the agriculture, energy, and environmental sectors that comprise these cooperatives. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {The traditional business focus of credit co-operatives is locally oriented and business success is explained by the efficient way to induce monitoring of borrowers. Church-based credit co-operatives in Germany are not that locally oriented but were extraordinary successful over the last decades. First, this analysis describes the special characteristics of church-based institutions compared to other credit co-operatives. This part is based on a historical backward glance, an analysis of annual reports and a survey on their business policy. Second, we discuss the special characteristics of church-based credit co-operatives to explain the business success in a broader context and to understand the perspectives of credit co-operative banking beyond the local orientation. © CIRIEC 2004.},

The methodology is a result of three Case Studies conducted in different structured forms and coordination of the production systems of the agribusiness: an agricultural cooperative, an integrator of chickens and the supply chain of bovine meat from a net of supermarkets. The study intended to analyze the process of structuring these chains; in other words, how these are structured, coordinated and their main characteristics. From the results of the three cases, the main stages of the process of structuring a supply chain of the agribusiness were defined.},

    abstract = {Faced with a visible and controversial instance of erosion on vineyards, the Lake County, California, Board of Supervisors founded an unusual organization-the Erosion Protection Education Commission (EPEC)-to offer nonbinding advice to grape growers concerning relevant agro-management practices. This study uses in-depth interviews, fieldwork, and secondary sources to contextualize EPEC within the county's stories about place-within its heritage narratives. The dominant heritage narrative (depicting Lake County's character as agriculturalist, cooperative and harmonious, and antiregulatory) is shown to be a major factor shaping and justifying the creation and operation of EPEC. Despite the existence of counternarratives, the dominant heritage narrative prefigured the emergence of EPEC and helped reinforce EPEC as the county's way of handling the growth of grape growing in the region and the resulting erosion problem. This article argues for greater attention to the role of community narratives about place in understanding how decisions are made on environmental and land-use issues. © 2004 Sage Publications.},

    abstract = {This study investigates the main determinants of Italian banks' cost efficiency over the period 1993-1996, by employing a Fourier-flexible stochastic cost frontier in order to measure X-efficiencies and economies of scale. Quality and riskiness of bank outputs are explicitly accounted for in the cost function and their impact on cost efficiency levels is evaluated. The results show that mean X-inefficiencies range between 13 and 15 per cent of total costs and they tend to decrease over time for all bank sizes. Economies of scale appear present and significant, being especially high for popular and credit co-operative banks. Moreover, the inclusion of risk and output quality variables in the cost function seems to reduce the significance of the scale economy estimates. Following Spong et al. (1995) a profitability test is undertaken that allows for the identification of banks that are both cost and profit efficient. The results suggest that the most efficient and profitable institutions are more able to control all aspects of costs, especially labour costs. Finally, the data are pooled to carry out a logistic regression model in order to examine bank- and market-specific factors that influence Italian banks' inefficiency. Confirming Mester (1993, 1996), inefficiencies appear to be inversely correlated with capital strength and positively related to the level of non-performing loans in the balance sheet. The analysis also shows that there is no clear relationship between asset size and bank efficiency. Finally, it is possible to infer that quoted banks seem to be on average more efficient than their non-quoted counterparts.},

Data were obtained through questionnaire, personal interview and observations from 75 respondents. Descriptive statistics and chi-square test were used to analyse the data. The constraints to fish farming in Delta State included poaching, high cost of inputs, lack of credit facilities, inadequate extension services, pollution, high cost of equipment and ecological problems like overflooding. The innovations adopted mostly by the respondents included fish breeding technique, feed formulation technique, fast growing exotic/hybrids and ecological disaster management/prevention. Others were pollution management, smoking equipment and brood stock selection technique. The chi-square analysis showed that a significant relationship exists between innovation adoption and the constraints to fish farming but did not show that the years of experience of the farmers have significant relationship with the constraints. The study recommended among others that the small-scale farmers should be encouraged and guided to form a cooperative society.},

These entities are especially important in finding answers to current demand requirements in the food market, bearing in mind the small family-scale nature of many of the farm enterprises in this sector. The present paper explores the ability of horticultural co-operatives in adapting to the new challenges in this sector from a productivity analysis viewpoint. Total factor productivity and efficiency are considered indicative measurements of the response of these organisations to the current market environment. In this study, Malmquist productivity indices are estimated using non-parametric techniques and taking as reference panel data of Andalusian horticultural co-operatives for the period 1995-2004. For a more in-depth analysis, productivity indices are broken down into technological change and efficiency change indicators, also considering the impact of other variables of co-operatives. The indicators obtained showed a relevant increase in efficiency for the period under study and a positive relationship between the results and quality investment. On the whole this research work adds to studies in the adaptation process of co-operatives in the current competitive scenario, offering insight into the improvement in total productivity and its correlation with several management variables in the fruit and vegetables sector.},

A few evidences are available in India when freshwater aquaculture resources (FARs) degraded under open access system are brought under a state or private or community management regime through appropriate changes in institutional arrangements and authority system. In recent years fish culture in freshwater has been managed under internal institutional structures of distributed governance or shared management system. Fishermen communities/resource users groups and the state or local government (panchayat) shared the responsibility of managing fresh water aquaculture by combining appropriate institutional skills of local resource users/local committees and technical, administration and financial resources available with the states. In the state of Chhattisgarh freshwater aquaculture has been managed under co-operative governance structure - an internal institutional structure model of distributed governance system. Looking to the importance of freshwater resources for fish culture in the state of Chhattisgarh an attempt has been made in this paper to present an overview of governance structure of freshwater aquaculture (culture fisheries in ponds and tanks) in the state and to discuss the outcomes of an in-depth analysis of fish co-operative society of Boria Khurd village of Raipur district of Chhattisgarh. This paper also makes an attempt to estimate willingness to pay for utilisation of freshwater resources (Boria Khurd irrigation tank) for fish culture by fishermen communities.},

The central findings are that the nature of ownership, the scale of an enterprise, and the governance form are key considerations in terms of the corporate responsibility of firms. Further explorations of CSR in relation to the nature of governance and ownership of firms, and the scale of their operations, would develop and explore this paper's central argument further and thus provide more valuable insights. The paper suggests that the issue of scale and the role of co-operatives may be of more significance as corporate governance comes under greater scrutiny and sustainability plays a more central role in business practice.

    abstract = {Under the Allied Occupation, immediately after the end of Second World War, pent-up tenant farmer frustration was translated into substantial support for the Japan Socialist Party through the farmer union movement. This support was enhanced by the institutional mechanisms of the land reform process, particularly land reform committees (nōchi iinkai), in which the Socialists played a predominant role. However, as the land reform process came to an end, the Socialists were unable to capture an emerging site of institutional influence over farmers, agricultural cooperatives (nōkyō). This failure was due to Socialist fragmentation and competition for power in farmer unions with the Japan Communist Party and in the agricultural cooperatives with centrist conservative forces. The result was that the Socialists lost a key constituency that came to be dominated by the conservatives. Nonetheless, this conservatism of Japanese farmers was not due to inherent cultural orientations of the rural population nor was it simply a product of land reform. The transformation of farmers into a key pillar of conservative party support was the outcome of a political process. © The Author 2005.

The first, Néguac, is located in a rural environment with important economic challenges. The second, Moncton-Beauséjour, is located in a very prosperous economic environment. These two credit unions have the additional characteristic of having experienced a merger in the past few years. We find that the role of management greatly differs from that of community's expectations. In an urban setting, competition is fiercer, management can focus more on its credit union's operations and is less scrutinized for its contribution to community. In a rural setting, parochial considerations are important, as are the credit union's contributions to various community projects. In both cases, the personal ties between employees and clients are very important social assets for the credit unions. Our study shows that even with the economic pressures justifying mergers and the re-engineering of activities, governance practices solidly rooted in the community remain important and tend to be preserved. Several facts reflect the influence of social cohesion on governance in a context of rationalization (mergers and re-engineering). This being said, we see signs that these social roots of governance evolve according to a widening of the territory of the reference community, possibly leading to a weakening of the links between governance and the parochial community and a strengthening of the links between governance and the province's francophone community.},

The underlying cost structure, couple with small farms, averaging 0.8 ha in size, prevent farmers from capturing economies of scale, limit farm profitability and hence farm modernization.

They have both economic and social goals. Over this last decade they have achieved remarkable growth levels and currently there are 600 such organisations in Ireland, with approximately 50 per cent of the adult population of Ireland belonging to a credit union. Accounting for credit unions is a much-neglected area and relatively little is known about the sector's accountability. This paper presents the results of an initial empirical study of the financial accountability of Irish credit unions. A series of interviews and a basic content analysis of 178 recent financial statements were used to identify the views of key stakeholders with respect to the discharge of financial accountability by credit unions and the current quality of financial reporting. Overall, the research points to a sector where financial accountability through the medium of the annual report is weak and possible adverse consequences of this are explored. On the basis of the interviews it is suggested that if changes in financial accountability are to be achieved then some more proactive engagement of parties external to the management of individual credit unions is needed. © 2004, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This analysis also focuses on the particular interwar conditions that favored the protectionism of the agricultural economy and the "State's supervision" of cooperatives, an essential element of agrarian policy, even during the first post-war period. Finally, we examine developments relating to the cooperatives during the transition from dictatorship to democracy, namely, the subsequent legislative interference, doubtful investments, as well as the transformation of the organizations into an arena of self-interest for political parties and their leaders and into a means of implementing government social policy.},

    abstract = {The study was undertaken in the Sirsa district of Haryana state, which was selected purposively. A multistage sampling technique was adopted for selection of district, blocks, village and finally pearl millet growers. As per objective of the study, the 30 heads of pearl millet cultivating farmers were taken from each selected village to make the sample size of 120 farmers. The study reveals that the constraints related to inputs like high price of weedicides, pesticides and fungicides and lack of irrigation facilities were very serious in nature. Failure of crop due to unfavourable weather conditions and using of seeds without treatments were very serious and lack of knowledge about time of application and recommended dose of fertilizers were serious constraints in production. In case of marketing of produce, the constraints like distress sale due to immediate need for money was very serious, whereas lack of warehousing facilities, lack of procurement of produce by government, low support price of produce and lack of co-operative organization for marketing of produce were found to be serious. Lack of demonstrations and trials of pearl millet production were considered to be very serious constraints by the respondents. The serious constraints identified by the farmers in case of technical guidance were lack of guidance for controlling insects-pests and application of pesticides and fungicides, lack of guidance for chemical weed control and chemical weedicides, lack of guidance for seed treatment, lack of knowledge of current advances for pearl millet production and lack of knowledge of recommended dose of chemical fertilizers. To overcome these constraints, efforts should be made to provide full package of practices about pearl millet production to the farmers well in advance by the extension personnel by visiting their fields.},

    abstract = {This article reports the findings of a project entitled 'The participation of members in mutual businesses'. A previous project developed a theoretical model of what makes people participate, focusing on the participation of public service users in council housing and social care services. The current project builds on this work, applying the 'mutual incentives model' to a population sample of area committee members and a random sample of non-participant members of a very large UK consumer co-operative, the Co-operative Group. Two arguments are presented as to why such research is needed. First, member participation in co-operative and mutual businesses is becoming an important issue both for this sector and more generally for public policy. Second, a comparison between a public services setting and a co-operative setting enables us to extend and further test the theoretical model. Two main features of the model are outlined: a 'mutual incentives theory' that goes beyond other models to combine individualistic and collectivistic motivations, and the 'participation chain', a synthesis of existing knowledge that joins motivations to three 'links' that we call 'resources', 'mobilization' and 'dynamics'. The article then summarizes the project methodology, and reports the main findings. As in the public services project, on the 'demand' side, collectivistic incentives prove to be dominant over individualistic, but with some individual 'internal' benefits also being important. On the 'supply' side, skills derived from previous experience were important, as were a positive evaluation of opportunities to participate, and recruitment through existing networks. We then compare the findings to those from the public service users and from a regional co-operative society; Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Co-op. Collective motivations are dominant in all three datasets, but are shown to vary in interesting ways that have important implications for member participation strategies. © CIRIEC 2004.

We develop and test several price-distance models for cargo, insurance and freight (CIF) plant pricing in the presence of varying degrees of exporter competition, and for discriminatory free-on-board (FOB) pricing at the farm. The price-distance functions describing spatial prices near processing plants all depend on local transport costs. But the pricing system (CIF or FOB) and the extent of local competition define the level and spatial rate of change in prices. Estimations of an empirical price-location function for Iowa during the spring of 2003 suggest that prices near the plants of four conventional businesses conform to the CIF pricing model. But prices near producer-owned firms or farmer cooperatives failed to show any statistically significant effect on nearby prices. One plant had a price-distance function that resembled FOB pricing.},

    abstract = {The most important agricultural cooperative types in Turkey are Agricultural Credit Cooperatives (ACCs), Agricultural Sales Cooperatives (ASCs), and Agricultural Development Cooperatives (ADCs). Despite their apparent growth in number, agricultural cooperatives have made only a limited impact on economic, social, and industrial development of the country and democratization of the agricultural sector and the community. The reasons for these pertain to some basic problem areas such as finance, integration, training and research, administration, legislation, and auditing [Mülayim, Z. G. (2003). Kooperatifçilik, Yetkin Yayinlari. Ankara]. To further explore these problem areas, this paper focuses on cooperative-shareholder relations in three major types of cooperatives in Turkey. According to the survey results, ADCs have emerged as the most prominent type of cooperative in terms of their members' participation into cooperative activities. The research results suggest that all members of ADCs were actively engaged in trading with their cooperatives, whereas 90% of members in ASCs and 80% in ACCs were trading with their cooperatives. When the three types of cooperatives are compared to each other with respect to members' perception of democratic administration, relations with the state organs, awareness of cooperative principles, and frequency of visits to cooperatives, ADCs are in a favourable position compared to ACCs and ASCs. The same situation is also valid for economic relations and interest in financial matters. ACCs come first in supplying farm inputs and they are followed by ASCs. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

    abstract = {There is ample evidence that much of Africa fails to meet basic criteria of agricultural sustainable development and environmental preservation. The objective of this study was to explore the management of natural resources by self-help farmer cooperatives. The study was carried out in five local government areas of Southwest Nigeria. These local government areas are forest zones covered by derived savannah. The raining season normally starts around April and ends in October/November, followed by a dry season. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people. Several methods were used to collect information. These included group discussions and questionnaires. Results from the study show that women have played a major role in almost every aspect of agriculture. Farmers possess valuable knowledge of the natural resources in their environment. They have made use of changes in soils and topography, which have resulted in planting patterns in the scattered farms around the villages and distant farm plots. With the help of cooperatives, farmers are taught how to develop innovatory regenerative techniques to conserve the tree stock on the farm. These techniques focus around the preservation of forest species. This study has shown that given the opportunity, local farmers can face the environment and tackle the problems when given the required support.},

Case studies of the three cooperatives are conducted, focusing on the organizational structures in terms of collective versus individualized attributes. The dissolution of the New Zealand Dairy Board created new market opportunities for the cooperatives. Hence, the co-operatives had reason to develop new market strategies, and in order to pursue these well, they changed their organizational structures. The observations indicate that more liberalized and open markets require cooperative organizational models with more individualized traits.},

The purpose of this article is to deconstruct this term by examining the concrete formative structuring of agricultural cooperatives, as cooperatives were formed in the early first half of the 20th century in the US. (and how this structuring is carried forth in derivative form to the present day). The construct "vaguely defined property rights" is an expression of the organizing rationale of neoclassical economics itself, as this view reaches the concrete limit of historical financial structures of cooperatives, what it can intellectually specify and appropriate, given its individualizing perspective.},

    abstract = {The notion that cooperatives should prosper when markets are poorly competitive has long been maintained as the competitive yardstick hypothesis. If cooperative formation is rational when market imperfections arise, we might wonder if dissolution is rational when the imperfections fade. In this article, we show that the answer is yes. More generally, we show that cooperatives would wish to choose from a continuum of cooperative, new-generation, and IOF models as market conditions and interest groups vary. For this purpose, we develop a general organizational framework of the agricultural processing firm, paying attention to the mechanisms distinguishing the cooperative from the IOF structure, the tension between active and retired members, and the influence of competition in raw and finished product markets. Optimality is considered first from the perspective of the cooperative member, in terms of maximizing the expected present value of net cash flows, then from the perspective of the policy maker, in terms of minimizing the probability of financial ruin. We find, as markets become increasingly competitive, that a traditional cooperative encourages lower investment and higher probability of bankruptcy than does the IOF. However, member's willingness to capitalize the cooperative improves abruptly as inactive members gain influence on the cooperative board or as the firm's financial structure merges toward the IOF model. Our findings are illustrated using data from the internal records of Tri Valley Growers, which until its bankruptcy in 2000 was on of the nation's leading agricultural processing cooperative.

Besides, the order in which these practices were adopted favoured the development of new organisational capabilities that have contributed to the appearance of advantages derived from the greater accumulated experience of employees in creating new projects that are designed to reduce residues and pollution. COATO has also obtained a competitive advantage in differentiation thanks to an improved brand image and to its increased credibility in business relationships. Finally, a positive correlation exists between the pioneering proactive strategy adopted by this cooperative and the improvement of its firm performance with respect to the other firms in its sector. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This makes them a potential tool in the fight against financial exclusion. Yet, the UK credit union movement is not regarded as being successful, even though there is evidence of much financial exclusion. This study is cross sectional in form, and evaluates characteristics that may contribute to the success of the UK credit union movement at national and regional level, in 2000. The findings are used to consider the impact of recent regulatory changes on the movement. The key findings are that there is a significant relationship between the success of a credit union, its size and the deprivation of the ward from which it sources its members. More specifically, larger credit unions and those located in more affluent wards, are more successful. Affiliation to the Irish League of Credit Unions and having a common bond of occupation, are also found to be contributing factors to credit union success. These results are taken as providing support for the recent changes implemented by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which is likely to result in the emergence of larger credit unions (through mergers), run by appropriately qualified persons, serving a more mixed-income membership base. It is, however, noted that the history of the UK movement is one of missed opportunities and only time will tell whether credit unions have the wherewithal to accept current opportunities. © CIRIEC 2005.},

    abstract = {Since Vietnam applied the "Doi Moi-Renovation" policy in 1986, and especially in 1988, the contract system between agricultural cooperatives and farmers was applied in agricultural production. Furthermore, the Land Law in 1993 indicates that farmers could use their land for the long-term (from 20 to 50 years). Therefore, land fragmentation in Vietnam has become a common phenomenon in all localities. This paper aims to provide an analysis of land reform and LC processes in Vietnam. In this regard, the study concentrates on the following issues: (1) to trace back former land reform in the period 1945-1953, in order to identify its results and errors; (2) to analyze contemporary LC in terms of an institutional analysis from the national to the commune level; (3) to study the procedure of LC in Dong Long Commune, Tien Hai District, Thai Binh Province. The main results of thi s research can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the land reform program carried out in the period 1953-1956 included 3 principal stages. The main objective of the program was to reduce the influence of colonists, feudalists and landlords by redistributing land to the landless peasants and laborers. As a result, over 810,000 hectares of land which belonged to them were confiscated, requisitioned, and purchased by the government. The land was then redistributed to 2,104,138 landless households, including 8,323,636 peasants and laborers. Secondly, a significant result of the LC process was to reduce by 50 % the total number of land parcels in Dong Long Commune. There were two general impacts of this process: (1) farmers were able to shorten the distance from their houses to the land parcels. Therefore, labor costs as well as long-term investment were reduced, resulting in increased benefits from agricultural production. (2) Land management activities at the commune level became much more effective because of the reduction in the number of parcels as a result of combining public land into a bigger area and building up the Land Use Planning Program for long-term developmment.},

Ten farm pairs, each of which consists of one organic and one conventional farm with less than 10 ha of fig plantation, were selected from five Fig Sales Cooperative (Taris-Incirbirlik) regions of Aydin Province with varying agro-ecological conditions. Although six of the organic farms matched or exceeded the production of their conventional counterparts, the three-year mean yield of the organic farms as a group was 5% lower than that of the conventional farms. However, excluding organic certification costs, mean variable costs and net income were similar for both groups, mainly because organic price premiums received by the farmers compensated for lower yields. If current organic certification costs paid by firms are included to farm budgets, the price premiums paid to organic producers would have to increase to 22% in order to equal the net incomes from conventional dried fig. Conventional farmers identified low and unstable prices as the main constraints for sustained production and stated further intensification of production as their main goal. Organic farmers focused on farm diversification and agronomic practices that permit organic farm management. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The purpose being to identify the benefits, limitations and lessons for the management of people in the co-operative and mutual sectors. Design/methodology/approach – The problem of inadequate Personnel or HRM systems in the majority of co-operatives has been established by the author over a period of seven years, field work with co-operative organizations including the international co-operative alliance (ICA), asian confederation of credit unions (ACCU), and the British society for co-operative studies. Direct interviews and a sample of HRM and Membership Relations audit forms developed as part of the ongoing field research and special project work have been applied to various co-operative contexts in all the regions of the ICA. Findings – The findings are that co-operatives generally are lagging behind the private sector in their application of all four approaches. Mostly smaller co-operatives lack effective basic personnel systems and few of the larger co-operatives go beyond HRM. This failure to develop clear programs for the utilization and development of their people is a missed opportunity. Practical implications – The membership base and its roots in a community of shared interests means that, whilst co-operatives have lessons to learn from all four approaches, they can and must go beyond them if they are to optimize their people-centered business advantage in the marketplace. Originality/value – The paper suggests a new strategy for co-operatives of Co-operative Social Capital Management to help them compete, whilst retaining their co-operative difference. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

    abstract = {Purpose – Sustainable consumption is increasingly on the policy menu, and local organic food has been widely advocated as a practical tool to make changes to conventional production and consumption systems. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based initiatives at achieving sustainable consumption objectives. Design/methodology/approach – A new multi-criteria evaluation tool is developed, from New Economics theory, to assess the effectiveness of initiatives at achieving sustainable consumption. The key indicators are: localisation, reducing ecological footprints, community building, collective action and creating new socio-economic institutions. This evaluation framework is applied to an organic producer cooperative in Norfolk, UK, using a mixed-method approach comprising site visits, semi-structured interviews and a customer survey. Findings – The initiative was effective at achieving sustainable consumption in each of the dimensions of the appraisal tool, but nevertheless faced a number of barriers to achieving its potential. Research limitations/implications – Future research could examine the sustainability preferences of non-consumers of local or organic food, to compare responses and assess the scope for scaling up initiatives like this. Practical implications – Ways forward for community-based sustainable consumption are discussed, together with policy recommendations. Community-based initiatives such as the local organic food network examined here should be supported to offer a diversity of local action. Originality/value – This paper presents the first empirical evaluation of a local organic food network as a tool for sustainable consumption. It makes a timely and original contribution on environmental governance and the role of new institutions which enable consumers to change their consumption patterns. It is of interest to academics, practitioners and policymakers concerned with sustainable development. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

    abstract = {This paper aims to describe and explain the changes which have taken place in the rural areas of Israel by focussing on a particular type of community-the moshav, which is a planned smallholders' settlement, based on family farms and legally organized as a cooperative society. An analysis of the changes that have taken place in the moshav in the past few decades reveals a process of rural restructuring, similar to that which is occurring in many developed countries. New economic activities have replaced farming as sources of income, and newcomers, mostly of urban origin, have invaded rural communities in search of a better quality of life. These changes derive from a combination of structural changes in agriculture, changing government policies and cumulative decisions of rural households. The result is a more heterogeneous moshav-physically, economically and socially, and growing regional, inter-village and intra-village disparities. These developments have a direct impact on the organizational structure of the moshav, its environmental qualities and its exchange relations with the urban sector. As part of the ongoing process of change the moshav is gradually losing some of its unique features, which formed the basis for its identity as a special type of rural community. This leads to the question of whether the moshav will be able to develop a new identity as a distinct type of rural community, or turn into a suburban or urban community. The answer will depend largely on the direction taken by government policy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Agricultural cooperatives are experiencing complex governance issues, particularly in light of increased heterogeneity of member interests, and increased market and regulatory pressures. Member commitment is often recognized to be a necessary ingredient in the cooperative success, and while primary agricultural cooperatives are built on that commitment, new generation cooperatives need not be. In this article we argue that some of the governance issues may be alleviated by the application of creating catalytic mechanisms, a process that builds cohesion, preserves cooperative identity, and is based on cooperative principles and values. We illustrate this technique with examples of successful agricultural and rural cooperatives that already use such mechanisms in their management strategies.},

    abstract = {Conservation of tropical biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has become more important as the area covered by natural ecosystems decreases. We analyzed the effects of local livelihoods, cooperative types, and selected biophysical variables (elevation, slope, percent shade, distance to the forest, coffee density, and coffee age) on tree biodiversity in shade coffee cooperatives of El Salvador. Tree inventories from 51 quadrats in coffee cooperatives included 2743 individuals from 46 families and 123 identified tree species. Species richness and tree diameters differed among some cooperatives, with greater richness associated with greater stem density; other biophysical variables had little impact on diversity. The amount of shade in the coffee plantations differed among cooperatives, particularly in the wet season. Of the tree species reported in a recent study of a neighboring forest and in the cooperatives (N = 227 species combined), 16% were present at both sites. The three coffee plantations shared 35% of total species reported from all cooperatives. Our research shows that the number of tree species found in a coffee plantation increases with the density of shade trees included in the system. In turn, agroecological management, as influenced by farmer livelihood strategies and cooperative types, directly affects shade canopy composition. Important factors to take into account are the types of farmer organizations present, the cost of maintaining species of conservation concern, and the potential benefits that conservation could bring to the livelihood strategies of farm households. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

    abstract = {A disciplinary system is an important mechanism to build the trust and commitment essential for maintaining effective organization for collective action. A case study in southern Brazil examines a situation in which the lack of effective monitoring and enforcement contributed to the decline of a cooperative, and asks why these activities were ineffectively applied. The literature suggests that the lack of application would be because the provision of monitoring and enforcement is itself a second-order public goods problem in which the whole cooperative benefits from the maintenance of discipline, but the costs fall on individuals who work to maintain it. This case study reveals contextual factors related to motivations for cooperation which may be more important in explaining the reluctance to impose discipline and the subsequent decline of trust and commitment among cooperative members. The study suggests that the components of an effective disciplinary system include rule formulation, monitoring and enforcement activities, accompanied by norms regarding the role of discipline in relation to overall cooperative objectives, and regarding the roles and responsibilities of leadership and general membership. A disciplinary system will be most effective when it is applied with attention to how it affects both external and internal motivations.},

Agroforestry may offer economically viable windows of opportunity for sustainable use of tropical forests whereas additional funds (e.g. through "Clean Development Mechanism") will be required to make re-forestation programs profitable. Alternative management practices in rice-based systems may offer win-win options to reduce emissions and - at the same time - to obtain another improvement in the production system, namely through optimized timing of nitrogen fertilizer, temporary drainage in irrigated rice fields and integrated residue management. Introducing pasture in degraded land can sequester substantial amounts of carbon (similar to re-forestation). Future research has to include participation of stakeholders from all conceivable levels, i.e. farmers' cooperatives, non-governmental organizations, national agricultural research centers and extension services, to devise simple and financially interesting incentives for reducing emissions. The feasibility of environmentally friendly production techniques has to be disseminated to the public through 'success stories' (documented in public media) and demonstration farms.},

The polity consists of informed and uninformed voters: only informed voters join parties, and the party campaign chest, the sum of its received contributions, is used to reach uninformed voters through advertising. A party is a cooperative organization of its members. Parties compete with each other strategically with respect to policy choice and advertising. We propose a definition of political equilibrium, in which party membership, citizen contributions, and parties' policies are simultaneously determined, for each of four financing institutions, running the gamut between a purely private, unconstrained system, to a public system in which all citizens have equal financial input. Equilibria under these institutions are computed by simulation for an example. The representation and welfare properties of these four institutions are compared from these simulations.

LNFCS have continued to purchase glass eels, when market prices have been favourable, to supplement the natural glass eel input. This study assesses the impact of these stocked glass eels on the Lough Neagh yellow and silver eel fisheries with a predictive model based on natural and stocked glass eel input, effort and environmental variables. Despite the final models' limitations to assess conclusively the contribution of the additional purchased glass eels the models can be used cautiously to predict, in the short term, yellow and silver eel output.

    abstract = {The Kyrgyz Republic is becoming a market economy. The transformation affects all sectors of the economy. For this primarily agrarian republic, the success of the transformation depends a great deal on land reforms, agricultural development, the reduction of poverty in rural areas, and meeting local demand for agricultural products. Of prime importance is increasing agricultural production. Accomplishing this requires improving the management structure for all forms of agricultural enterprise; increased agrarian investment; greater education and training for personnel at all levels of the market; and the introduction of various economic structures, including farm cooperatives, associations, and stockshare societies.

    abstract = {Not-for-profit organisations now very often compete with one another, ard with for-profit organisations for government funding and private philanthropy. Management and employees in this sector are increasingly required to demonstrate their competitiveness in terms of financial measures and performance criteria. Yet, very little is known about the impact of these shifts on employee relations in not-for-profit organisations. Drawing on detailed case study research into credit unions, which are not-for-profit players in the predominately for-profit financial services sector, the paper highlights the contradictions inherent in, and consequences that result, when not-for-profit organisations adopt similar customer and human resource strategies to their for-profit counterparts. The findings in relation to credit unions have important implications for not-for-profit organisations in the voluntary and welfare sectors where the adoption of strategies from the for-profit sector could potentially undermine the ability of emloyees to deliver care to some of the most vulnerable members of our society.

Farmers in two case study communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal face high transaction costs as reflected primarily in their low levels of education and literacy, lack of market information, insecure property rights, poor road and communication infrastructure, and long distances to markets. Analysis of the reasons why cooperatives were originally established in various parts of the world suggests that most of the causes (such as poverty, market failure and high transaction costs) also apply to the study farmers, as do the seven international principles of cooperation. Smallholder farmers in both case study regions have the potential to grow high-value crops such as vegetables, fruit and cut flowers. In the supply chain from farm to market, the optimum boundary for each organization involved in the chain (e.g. cooperative and investor-oriented firm) depends on the minimum operational and transaction costs for each business.},

The movement focuses on the integration of vertical and horizontal resources and promotion of the development and expansion of internal potential (neili) within the cooperatives through the introduction of external factors. To be specific, new rural reconstruction is about the comprehensive reconstruction of the peasants in economic, cultural, social, political, and other fields, which requires the utilization of existing village resources such as religion, clans, institutions (tizhi), and so on, so that former expressions of cooperation will bring about new ones. The breakthrough in Lankao county centers on cultural troupes (wenyi dui) and seniors ' associations.

Of particular interest is the way idioms and forms of struggle used by bureaucrats, peasants and agricultural labourers in a Peruvian agrarian cooperative during that decade challenge one of the enduring myths of development theory. The latter invokes a familiar dichotomy to explain the failure of rural cooperatives: a powerful state bureaucracy imposing inappropriate policy on an undifferentiated and uniformly powerless peasantry. The case study presented here suggests that, on a number of crucial issues (privatization of co-owned means of production, the employment of labour-power that was unfree), it was much rather better-off peasants who overruled bureaucrats and imposed their own accumulation project.},

Defining a cooperative broadly as any type of alliance formed by producers for their mutual benefit, we base the discussion on three types of cooperative; traditional, "new generation" and learning networks. Our main focus is on cooperatives as an alliance between members, but we also discuss alliances between cooperatives. We find that there is a gap in the literature relating to the analysis of alliances with more than two members (such as cooperatives), so the linkages between the theories and cooperative types must be seen as being somewhat tentative. We hypothesise that the RBV, social network theory and trust and cooperation theories are in fact, applicable to multiple-member alliances, but their relevance is likely to become less as the number of members increase. © 2006 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IAMA).

The sample consisted of 1,051 survey responses from CEOs and board chairs representing 713 credit unions. As member-benefit nonprofit organizations, credit unions rely almost exclusively on voluntary board members in an oversight capacity. Results support the contention that board development practices lead to more capable board members, and the presence of these board members tends to explain board performance. The study advances the understanding of nonprofit board development practices by further defining the concept and proposing an empirically tested assessment strategy. Furthermore, the findings support using specific recruitment practices that should strengthen nonprofit boards. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Fulton hypothesized that forces external to the cooperative, especially technology and member individualism, would increasingly emerge as obstacles to success in North American agricultural cooperatives. Cook hypothesized forces internal to the cooperative, especially potential negative consequences of vaguely defined property rights, would challenge cooperative organizational growth in subsequent years. Three strategic choices were identified as potentially efficient, that is, the option to exit either the sector or the organizational form,to continue strategically and structurally with moderate changes to organization form, or to shift to a more radical form of organizational structure. This article and session attempt to describe and analyze organizational design initiatives adopted since the mid 1990s. This article complements and expands a typology of discreteinstitutional arrangements (i.e., cooperative models) based upon a broad definition of ownership rights comprising residual claim and control rights (Chaddad and Cook). We argue that cooperative models may be distinguished by how ownership rights are defined and assigned to economic agents tied contractually to the firm (members, patrons, and investors). In addition, we develop a set of observations that suggest a research agenda based on a new institutional approach to understanding organization change in the food system.

One is towards the creation of growth processes through formulas which aim to bring under the same roof asset holders who by their very nature are a difficult fit, all the while trying to maintain certain cooperative principles.

    abstract = {Coffee is one of the most important Third World export commodities, and 70% of the producers are small-scale farmers. Coffee producers are often poor and marginalised, and their situation is aggravated by fluctuating market prices and collusive behaviour among intermediary coffee purchasers. Coffee co-operatives may potentially increase the incomes of these farmers by distributing a larger share of the final price to the co-operative members. Co-operatives can also have a pro-competitive effect on imperfect market situations, and thereby increase income levels also for non members. Moreover, they have the potential to educate and empower marginalised farmers. However, lack of finance and problems with free riding, costs of control and a too short time horizon are problems faced by co-operatives. Because of that, benevolent governments or NGOs have tried to support co-operatives with finance and expertise, but often with an unsuccessful outcome. The Fair Trade system distributes money to small-scale coffee producers via carefully selected co-operatives. The study of Fair Trade co-operatives in Chiapas shows that they are successfully functioning organisations, and that they do seem to have a pro-competitive effect on an imperfect market situation. But the co-operatives also have many disadvantages compared to their private competitors. This means that they could probably not have reached their level of success without the premium received from the alternative markets (Fair Trade and organic). Thus, the support from the Fair Trade system seems to strengthen agricultural co-operatives.},

    abstract = {Nitrogen fertilisation is a source of potential groundwater pollution and is a key issue in the current debate about the environmental impacts of agricultural production. It is also a key element in the management of cropping systems by farmers. Therefore, cropping system design entails the understanding and evaluation of farmers' fertilisation practices. Biophysical models describing the soil-plant system can serve this purpose. A comparison between model outputs and farmers' practices was made of a set of 128 apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) plots from 31 members of a farmers' co-operative in south-eastern France. Farmers' fertilisation practices were compared with theoretical practices generated by a series of soil-plant system models of increasing complexity, each model giving the amount of nitrogen that should be applied to the plot according to the knowledge included in the model. The model that reproduced farmers' fertilisation practices most closely was the most complex, taking all plant requirements, soil organic matter and residue mineralisation, denitrification and irrigation supply into account. A Monte Carlo method showed that the differences between farmers' practices and model outputs were not random. Spatial analysis showed a strong spatial organisation of these differences, mainly due to three farms. This congruence between farmers' practices and model outputs suggests the existence of some indicators that depict the N nutrition status of the orchard as a basis for rules indicating how much nitrogen should be applied. The spatial analysis suggests the existence of farmer and neighbourhood effects, which need to be explained. Models appear to be useful tools to study farmers' practices by removing biophysical effects (soil, variety, etc.). This raises new questions concerning agricultural research at the interface between the biophysical and social sciences. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results show that the total risk of dairy farmers is 57 % and the possible loss is approximately 2000$. Business risk is 50 % while the other half is attributed to financial rigidities. Research results also suggest that the most appropriate risk management strategy is transferring risk in order to ensure sufficient returns to meet debt services and to operate expense commitments in the research area.

One reason for this could be that at least in India, largely, cooperatives have a public image of either being a sham or being government–managed.

This is a case study of a 58 year old, self–reliant and member controlled consumer cooperative. Besides checking on its cooperative and self–reliant character, its structure and processes have also been documented in some detail to aid in its replication.

Production is based on enhanced beds management. It is an activity of social importance, as many coastal communities find their income and work opportunities in it. In the state of Tabasco there are 1,371 oyster fishers in 14 cooperative societies, and 3,000 shuckers. There is an extensive bed management activity with seeding of collected spat and shell laying. Although a minimum legal size of 80 mm is required, it is not observed. We identified the growth equation parameters for size structure data for five beds from three lagoons. Maximum height varied between 118 and 140 mm with means between 58 and 63 mm. The von Bertalanffy growth equation parameters were L8 between 124 and 154 mm, with K between 0.71 and 1.21. In most cases a significant influence of seasonality was detected, mostly during winter, but at some localities it was during summer. Total mortality Z varies from 1.64 to 2.39. As no data on natural mortality M were available we applied 25, 50 and 75% of Z to M, which allowed us to model the behaviour of the populations under different rates of fishing mortality F and the impact of different M in yields. We conclude that the populations are over exploited in size and this is affecting yields. Besides, the populations are at risk of collapse if natural mortality increases awing to any environmental impact. It is recommended to increase mean size to 90 mm which means a minimum catch size of over 70 mm, as required by the official norm, this would increase yields in weight 100% and there would be a significant number of organisms to buffer any increase on natural mortality. © 2007 University of Salento - SIBA http://siba2.unile.it/ese.},

    abstract = {A two-stage procedure is employed to evaluate the determinants of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in Australian credit unions over the period 1992/1993 to 1994/1995. In the first stage, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to calculate technical and scale efficiency indices for a sample of credit unions. The second stage uses a multinomial logit model to relate credit union efficiency scores, along with other managerial, regulatory and financial factors, to the probability of credit unions acquiring or being acquired by another credit union. The results indicate that asset size and quality, management ability, earnings and liquidity are a significant influence on the level of M&A. One primary influence on credit union acquisitions would appear to be the perceived compatibility in associational bond and membership. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

It is argued that in terms of a developmental typology the credit union industry in Great Britain is at a nascent stage of development, the industries in Ireland and New Zealand are at a transition stage while the US credit union industry is mature in nature. In progression between stages the analysis considers the influence of factors such as situational leadership, the complexion of trade associations, professionalisation, regulatory and legislative initiatives and technology. The analysis concluded that while there was a substantial commonality of experience, there were also significant differences in the impact of these factors. This consequently encouraged the recognition of the existence of 'a variety of the species' in respect of credit union development. © 2002 CIRIEC.},

Forty out of seventy-one cooperatives were examined by means of a structured questionnaire in February 2000. The results indicate that the participation of farm-women in these cooperatives provided them a source of income and gave them independence, power of control and self-esteem.

Yet, there is little empirical evidence of the strategic impact of resources and capabilities that can be shared in marketing's cooperative relationships. This study raises two research questions: (1) does a firm's relational capability contribute to its export competitive advantages? and (2) does a firm's relational factors make an incremental contribution to its export advantage and performance beyond the contribution of firm factors. A significant conclusion of this study is that after controlling for internal firm factors, relational factors make a unique contribution to both the competitive advantages of the firm and its export performance. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Second, it indicates that successful financing strategies are ikely to involve an overlap of both formal and informal practices. Third, in the documented case the tenants' group succeeded in leveraging the development potential of their land to cross-subsidise its housing costs. However, the paper highlights the difficulties involved and cautions against any policy reliance on such a strategy as a financing panacea.},

    abstract = {Both in conception and practice, cooperatives in the Punjab have been an important component of the government's development policy. The model was conceived as a 'multipurpose unit' aimed at serving its members by supplying credit, improved farm inputs, storage facilities, marketing assistance etc. In practice, however the major function has most often remained limited to the provision of credit and the improved farm inputs. As the bulk of resources have been supplied by the government, cooperatives are as much an agent of government administration, as a voluntary organisation. Even from the narrow perspective of their role as a vehicle for channelling government funds, cooperatives have been more active in distributing loans than in collecting these when due. The Punjab cooperatives are rural institutions which permit collective action by the more progressive farmers and which mediate between these farmers and the government. It enables the administration to target benefits and regulatory policy on that group of farmers, large or small, who contribute most to governments development goals-those who adopt improved technology. Nevertheless, cooperatives seem to have been less successful in accomplishing the governments' stated purposes, as the strategy has produced dissemination of benefits generally only to the most privileged sections of the rural society. The wider conclusion is that the experience in the Punjab hardly amounts to a test of the appropriateness of the institution of cooperatives as a development agent. The divided and hierarchical social structure of rural Punjab may point to the need for greater appropriateness of some alternative institutional device to encourage development.},

One issue underlying the nature of competition between the two, however, concerns the most appropriate way to model their interactions. Two possible approaches are the dominant-firm price-leadership model and the generalized Cournot model. In the former model, credit unions act as fringe suppliers who are price-takers in a homogenous product market. In the latter, they possess (limited) market power. One way to distinguish the two is by examining the impact of credit union market shares on their pricing, as the two models imply differing effects. Our results are more consistent with the "credit unions as fringe suppliers" view. Using a pooled cross-section time series of 77 small local consumer lending markets throughout the U.S., each with 10 observations over 5 years, the focus is on a loan product ex ante thought to be sold in local markets, unsecured (non-credit card) loans. For this product, increasing credit union market shares reduces credit union loan rates, consistent with a fringe supplier hypothesis.},

    abstract = {Cooperative societies vary in the extent to which reproduction is skewed toward one or a few socially dominant animals. Many recent models attempt to explain this variation on the basis that a dominant who benefits from the presence of subordinates may offer them incentives, in the form of reproductive opportunities, to remain in the group. While most societies contain multiple members, however, these models have considered only the relationship between a dominant and a single subordinate or have assumed that all subordinates are identical. We develop an incentive-based evolutionary stable strategy model of reproductive skew in three-member groups, in which subordinates may vary in their opportunities for independent reproduction, their contribution to group productivity, and in their relatedness both to the dominant and to one another. Our model demonstrates that the conclusions of two-member models cannot all be generalized to larger groups. For example, relatedness among group members can influence whether or not the dominant does best to offer staying incentives to subordinates in a three-member, but not a two-member, group. Both the degree of skew and group stability depend on the relatedness between subordinates as well as on the relatedness of each to the dominant, and the incentives that each individual subordinate receives are influenced by the traits of the other. Whether such effects increase or decrease skew and group stability depends crucially on whether a third group member increases group productivity to a greater or lesser extent than the first.},

This paper examines the local-level effects of that paradox by briefly reviewing the history of the Sri Lankan state's use of cooperatives since independence in 1948 and by looking at the rise and fall of one particular pottery production and marketing cooperative over that same 50-year period. In the process, we see that the effects of state economic policies are not determinative but, rather, inherently uncertain because: 1) the ideological apparatus of which the policies are a part shifts over time; and 2) center policies interact in unpredictable ways with local agents, discourses, and agendas. These findings help us to better understand the complex and contradictory nature of relations between "state" and "village".},

Furthermore it is shown that recognition of relevant heterogeneity is crucial and that inter-farm comparisons, careful integration of beta and gamma approaches and multivariate modes of analysis are needed.},

    abstract = {The system of agricultural production in the Red River Delta based on village-level agricultural cooperatives has changed since Resolution 10 of 1988. The function of cooperatives was greatly reduced, and the household came to be considered as an autonomous unit of economy. In the process of change in the cooperatives' function, economic activities took on greater importance. A new law on cooperatives in 1996 also promoted the establishment of new types of cooperatives as autonomous economic organizations. Discussions on cooperatives' function, however, have tended to be too abstract and idealized and to lack specific detail. This paper, therefore, evaluates the economic activities of cooperatives based on an analysis of actual economic activities in one village. Coc Thanh Cooperative (CT) in Nam Dinh Province was chosen for a case study, and its cooperative's economic activities were evaluated from the accounts of revenue and expenditure of the Irish potato business, including the cultivation, and the storage and sale businesses. It was found that the executive staff of CT actively managed the potato business and produced a profit for the whole cooperative. They controlled the material cost and the cooperative's profit according to fluctuations in climatic conditions and market prices in order to generate profits both for the potato farmers and for CT. Besides their regular salary, they received a bonus as reward for managing the potato business. Why did the cooperative manage the potato business as CT's business, rather than leaving it to individual farmers? The advantages of having the potato business run by CT were that it could provide funding and information, function as an arbitrator, operate in line with government policy, and perform welfare works. The disadvantage was its economic inefficiency as a profit-making organization. To improve its economic efficiency as a profit-making organization, CT paid a bonus to the executive staff, thereby motivating them to efficient management. CT was an organization with two purposes: the pursuit of economic efficiency and the promotion of welfare works. Since villagers have to get funds by themselves and do public undertakings and welfare works in their own village, economic activities by farmers' associations such as cooperatives should be promoted.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we explore the dissemination potential of organic farming in Andalucía, using the case of Olivarera de los Pedroches, a small farmer cooperative. This will be done in the search for an agroecological strategy in the olive tree organic agricultural sector. A comparative analysis of organic and conventional olive oil production is made: both in economic terms, and regarding employment creation, taking into account its environmental benefits. This will permit us to shed light on certain elements necessary in the design of rural policies linked to this economic sector, and in the family farming social stratum. After a brief analysis of the Andalucían inequality structure in rural areas - both historically and at present times - this work presents the following issues: (i) a systematic characterization of European olive cultivation, with special reference to the Spanish and Andalucían situations; (ii) an exploration of the socio-economic impact of the case study within the context of the major actors involved, and their relations in terms of its reproducibility, taking into account their relationships with institutional and policy arrangements. Organic agriculture in Spain has developed slowly since 1995 - the year in which aid towards this type of production began to be established - and, at present, begins to show an exponential increase. Many farmers began the transition to ecological handling of olive groves. Consequently, the organic management of the olive groves and the sale of organic olive oil can be a stimulus to farmers to increase their profits. Hence, it can be a fundamental pillar on which to establish rural development in areas with a high level of importance concerning this crop. In this work, data clearly show that, in spite of high costs, organic olive farming has advantages over conventional agriculture in terms of incomes and employment.

The authors stress the importance of institutional factors in explaining this panorama. The Spanish case is used as an example of the influence of institutional factors on the process of the establishment of federations of agricultural co-operatives. In particular, it focuses on decision-making institutions, at the regional, national and European level, which have oriented such a process toward unitary models of representation.},

    abstract = {Development enthusiasts are at crossroads with regard to rural finance in low-income countries. Experience has led to a sharp turn from supply led finance to developing sustainable financial intermediaries. Having encountered many, detrimental and costly failures with the supply led approach, there is excitement following emerging successes of the 'new approach'. There are several success stories documented from Asia, however these are not replicable in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper presents an emerging sound model of an RFI in the region, i.e. a model built by The Kilimanjaro Co-operative Bank of 1995 and Savings and Credit Co-operatives Societies (The KCB-SACCOS model) in Northern Tanzania. The KCB-SACCOS model has managed to overcome difficulties that have led to failures of former rural financial institutions. The successes of the KCB-SACCOS model are attributed to its foundational basis and key operational features. It is an organisation that originates from the grassroots. There is also a strong sense of ownership by the 'client-owner', democratic leadership at SACCOS and a sound SACCOS' representation at the KCB policy body. SACCOS act as strategic nodes of a web to reach a wide client base. The KCB-SACCO model has strategically tapped on the coffee economy and fits well within the socio-economic milieu of the local people and makes use of principles found in the local informal financial practices. The paper elaborates on these features and draws lessons for one approach to develop sustainable rural financial institutions in sub-Saharan Africa.},

    abstract = {The old paradigm of development is that of a Mai-Baap Sarkar, based on the assumption that the active involvement of the state is essential for economic development and poverty removal. This spread of the Leviathan has been accompanied by a gradual but pervasive deterioration of governance. There is therefore the need for a new paradigm that recognizes that ‘government failure’ is a much more important problem than ‘market failure’, based on a recognition of the strengths and the weakness of the state and the people. A democratic society has enormous potential for entrepreneurship, innovation and creative development. The people, their diverse forms of activity and association such as companies, cooperatives, societies, trusts and other NGOs must be allowed and encouraged to play their due role. The state must focus on what it alone can do best and shed all activities that the people can do as well or better. The heavy hand of the government in the form of incentives, distorting laws, rules, regulations, procedures and red tape, have also corrupted industry, business and other organized interest groups. These must be removed so as to release the energy of the people. The state should confine itself to managing the economy so as to accelerate employment and income growth in a self-sustaining manner, ensure that all citizens receive their entitlements of basic public goods and services, and empower the poor so that they have equal rights (and responsibilities) with other citizens. © 2002, Sage Publications.

Credit unions are particularly vulnerable to contradictory accountability requirements, because they can serve a number of different socioeconomic purposes. They may therefore face multiple lines of managerial and political accountability in a situation where they remain highly dependent on external stakeholders for funding. Survey evidence shows that the measures widely used to gauge credit union performance are not consistent with the policy objectives of the key stakeholders setting them. Taken together, they also fail to provide a balanced scorecard to support effective internal management decision making and external scrutiny. It is contended that key stakeholders need to compensate for the currently skewed performance scorecard with indicators that are sensitive to credit unions' specific objectives and to the stage they have reached in the credit union life cycle of development. Proposals for a wider and more appropriate suite of performance indicators are therefore outlined.},

    abstract = {This paper seeks to examine the link between the academic debates on obligation contracting and its successful implementation as a mode of governance. The literature reports that firms are increasingly entering into long-term, high dependency exchanges as a result of: increased demand for quality goods, demand for variability of goods, demand for constant innovation, severe price competition and increasing technology costs. These changes are forcing firms to enter into complex relationships with other firms in order to remain competitive. Examples of such relationships are: relational contracting, network organisations, strategic alliances and horizontal co-operation. The increase in number and complexity of these exchanges in an environment characterised by uncertainty has led to the increased interest in the use of obligation contracting. Furthermore, this interest has been reinforced by the changing nature of products being exchanged. More knowledge-based products and information-based modes of production necessitate the sharing of strategically sensitive data. Hence the rise of importance of obligation contracting is not only due to the increased number of complex exchanges in uncertain environments, but also the very nature of the goods being exchanged.},

    abstract = {Rural credit in the Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy became available on a wide scale only after the abolition of serfdom in 1848. Although organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and Schulze-Delitzsch credit cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission of aiding the poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s, however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for promoting urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial institutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new cooperatives contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry into the Czech national life. © 2004 by Agricultural History Society. All rights reserved.},

The first part uses panel data in the probit model to relate pure technical efficiency, along with other managerial, regulatory and financial factors, to the probability of merger activity, either as an acquiring or acquired entity. The results indicate that loan portfolio diversification, management ability, earnings and asset size are a significant influence on the probability of acquisition, though the primary determinant of being acquired is smaller asset size. The second part uses a tobit model adapted to a panel framework to analyse post-merger efficiency.

    abstract = {The seed industry in Southern Africa has been radically transformed by a policy of liberalisation and privatisation started under structural adjustment. Traditionally under the domain of parastatals, seed research, production and distribution has been criticised for failing to provide modern variety seed to smallholder farmers. However, the private companies which have stepped in to replace seed parastatals in southern Africa have proven no more effective in meeting the demands of smallholders. The Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, concluded in 1994 as part of the Uruguay Rounds of GATT negotiations, as well as certain biotechnological innovations such as Terminator or Traitor technologies, threaten to further undermine local seed production and consumption by destroying the informal seed sector so central to agricultural production in the region. What alternatives exist? The success of Zimbabwe's maize seed network offers some insight. Resting on a unique relationship between government and nationally based producer co-operatives, Zimbabwe's maize programme was able to provide nearly every farmer in the country with hybrid maize suited for local growing conditions.},

The decline of manufacturing and agriculture has reduced the share of credit going to these sectors. Credit unions and the National Insurance Fund are becoming more important in mobilizing financial savings. The Barbadian financial system has experienced a significant degree of financial innovation including the institution of mutual funds, venture capital companies, a stock exchange, as well as the introduction of new financial instruments.

Finns consider forestry and forest industries to be very important sectors for their economy and for the environment. The particularly close relationship between Finns and their forests is explained by widespread forest ownership (with almost one family in five owning a piece of the forest), free access for people to all forests and good cooperation between the forest sector and educational authorities. The Finnish Forest Association (FFA) - the cooperative organization representing forest-related organizations in Finland such as private forest owners, forest industries, the Finnish State Forest Enterprise and research, recreation and education organizations - follows the development of public opinion through regular and rigorous studies.

The paper concludes that benchmarking is strategically feasible, that it has a favourable impact on the perceptions and attitudes of staff and members of participating cooperatives, and that it yields workable priorities and management recommendations, which can be implemented. Wider adoption of the technique by cooperatives is therefore recommended as a viable survival strategy - an alternative to the recent preference for abandonment of cooperative status. This is of particular significance for the marketing/entrepreneurship interface of FCEs in Wales.},

We defend the idea that this kind of cooperative organisation of economic activities represents an appropriate answer to the flexibility required by ever-changing markets, and thus an appropriate industrial organisation model for the development of manufacturing activities in emerging economies.

Farm cooperatives undoubtedly belong to this group. In recent years, Spanish farm cooperatives have been experiencing substantial business development. This process is a consequence of the latest changes in the regulations governing Spanish cooperatives. Major cooperative groups with high turnovers have developed in this positive environment. Although there are differences between countries, the European cooperative movement is a good example of the prominence that cooperatives have achieved in many sectors. Their traditional goals are changing and one of their current priorities is to meet the requirements of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) as regards agricultural multi-functionality. Nevertheless, the principles of this concept were already present in their own tenets. This paper aims to show the role of the cooperatives in the new social requirements, taking into account their functioning principles and the new conceptual frame they are involved in.},

In promoting transboundary cooperation, Germany has pursued an agenda of institutionalization based on the vertical and horizontal integration of different spatial levels of transboundary interaction through both state and nonstate actors that represent European border regions. This essay characterizes and discusses the development of transboundary cooperative organizations along Germany's border and the attempts to establish a system of multilevel governance to address border‐related issues. Germany's track record in the latter respect is mixed. Intergovernmental rivalries, as well as basic design flaws in European policy are singled out as primary obstacles to more effective cooperation. The overall political context of transboundary regionalism is framed here in terms of Germany's pivotal economic and political role within the overall project of European integration. Given the ambiguities of cooperative experiences, the essay concludes with more general research questions regarding the significance of transboundary forms of regional governance within an evolving European Union. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

    abstract = {New cooperative organizations, including rural community cooperatives, rural cooperative foundations (RCFs), rural shareholding cooperative enterprises (RSCEs) and farmers' specialized associations (FSAs), have mushroomed since the reform in rural China and play a very important and indispensable role in promoting the Chinese rural economy. However, when comparing the Chinese rural cooperatives with standardized foreign cooperatives, in terms of the controlling decision-making power and residual claimant right, only a small number of cooperative-oriented RSCEs and FSAs are similar to their foreign counterparts. Furthermore, some of the Chinese rural cooperatives could be regarded as quasi-cooperatives, while some so-called cooperatives are, in fact, investor-oriented firms (IOFs). Since there is no legislation that covers cooperatives in China, governments at different levels may vary in their attitudes and behaviours towards different types of rural cooperatives. In addition, the existing national income distribution system and macro-economic framework, which are biased towards urban areas and urban industry, together with the imperfect commodity and production factors market, make governments intervene directly in the economic activities of rural cooperatives in order to realize their macro-economic goals. Meanwhile, rural cooperatives, out of concern for their own economic interests, sometimes actively seek protection from the state.},

    abstract = {Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, banks are required to ascertain the credit needs of the people that reside in their communities, and to take affirmative steps to meet those credit needs. Credit unions were not included in the Act because is was felt that they lacked the ability and/or the incentive to neglect their "communities" of members: They were not-for-profit, relatively small in size, and limited to serving people who shared a single "common bond". In the last two decades, the definition of what constitutes a "common bond" has expanded dramatically. This Note argues that, as a result of the changes that the redefinition of the "common bond" requirement has produced, credit unions now have the ability and the incentive to engage in the same types of lending discrimination that led Congress to impose the Community Reinvestment Act upon banks. Thus, this Note contends, credit unions should be subject to a community reinvestment law of their own.},

    abstract = {Despite TQM's (total quality management) stated emphasis on more cooperative employee-management relations, we argue that TQM, as it is presently conceived and practiced, obscures but does not reduce management control over workers. Based upon examination of the foundational TQM texts and of 25 implementation guides, we show how the language of 'empowerment' and 'self-management', central to the TQM mission, is often used in equivocal ways that compromise the meaning of these concepts as they were originally developed and used by radically egalitarian grassroots organizations. We also show in several respects how TQM's organizational changes may further perpetuate inequality among workers. By distilling the key ideal-typical features of the total quality organization and comparing them with the ideal-type characteristics of the machine-based bureaucracy and of the egalitarian-democratic organization, we bring into sharp relief how they are not the same. In bringing to the TQM literature the practices and standards developed over a 150-year history by genuinely egalitarian cooperative organizations, we are able to show the profound differences in form that prevail despite their parallel language. Should TQM practitioners wish to adopt the substance of these shared control methods, they would do well to learn from the examples of the grassroots organizations that pioneered these empowerment methods. © 1999 SAGE.},

Cooperative selling institutions are potential catalysts for mitigating these costs, stimulating entry into the market, and promoting growth in rural communities. Trends in cooperative organization in east-African dairy are evaluated. Empirical work focuses on alternative techniques for effecting participation among a representative sample of peri-urban milk producers in the Ethiopian highlands. The variables considered are a modern production practice (cross-bred cow use), a traditional production practice (indigenous-cow use), three intellectual-capital-forming variables (experience, education, and extension), and the provision of infrastructure (as measured by time to transport milk to market). A Tobit analysis of marketable surplus generates precise estimates of non-participants' 'distances' to market and their reservation levels of the covariates - measures of the inputs necessary to sustain and enhance the market. Policy implications focus on the availability of cross-bred stock and the level of market infrastructure, both of which have marked effects on participation, the velocity of transactions in the local community and, inevitably, the social returns to agroindustrialization.

The paper also demonstrates how wider trends in UK retailing favour nationally-organized chains such as the current market leader - Tesco. This inherent inability of the Co-op to compete nationally eventually led to it having to retreat from the successful superstore format so favoured by its rivals.

Participatory appraisal of the fishing community revealed decreasing reliance on fishing income with many fishermen moving away to supplementary occupations because of declining fish catches. Illegal fishing and theft of fishing gear resulting from open access, difficulties encountered in enforcing fisheries regulations and the need for fishermen to find alternative sources of income during low water levels are the major management problems. The top-down centralized management approach previously practised was ineffective in addressing any of these issues. Therefore, the possibilities and limitations for introducing co-management as an alternative management strategy were discussed. Financial hardship coupled with perceived benefits through state sponsored welfare schemes caused a positive attitude change among fishermen, making them respond favourably to fishery management. Establishing a licensing system for controlled access, ensuring greater user-group participation through equitable distribution of state sponsored benefits among members, attempting to enforce penalties for illegal fishing linked with surprise checks to enforce management regulations, and obtaining stakeholder perceptions regarding management issues are some of the recent steps taken by the Fishermen's Co-operative Society which would positively contribute towards developing effective co-management in this reservoir.},

Three smallholder irrigation management systems namely the government managed Agritex, the farmer managed community, and the informal bani (dambo) are compared. In the Agritex schemes, participating in labor groups is the only variable influencing financial performance. None of the variables studied are important on the community schemes, perhaps because unlike on Agritex schemes, where the government makes production decisions, community scheme farmers make their own decisions. In the bani schemes, marketing cooperatives, credit use, literacy, record keeping, and the gender of the plot holder are significant. The government should consider extending credit, developing sustainable production recommendations, and developing training programs directly applicable to the bani environment. The bani system achieves the most equitable income distribution and is more efficient than both the community and Agritex systems. The government policy of ignoring this system in development efforts directly contradicts the concepts of equity and efficiency. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This facility is called a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). For operation and maintenance of CETP, small scale tanners formed a co-operative society. The expenses for operation and maintenance of CETP are being shared by participating tanneries. Wastewater management for the cluster of small scale tanneries was studied in details and various measures were incorporated to improve performance of the CETP and also to improve treated effluent quality to confirm standard prescribed by regulatory agencies. Performance of existing CETP was evaluated. Based on the results, bench scale laboratory treatability studies were conducted for improvement in treated effluent quality and also to suggest appropriate modifications to the CETP.

    abstract = {This paper reviews the current regulatory framework for community development financial institutions (CDFIs), which aim to enable ‘socially excluded’ people and enterprises to access finance. Its focus is primarily on the UK, though account is taken of developments in other EU member countries and at the EU level. In the UK the most developed regulations relate to industrial and provident societies, which are essentially financial cooperatives lending to small enterprises and not for profit organisations, and credit unions, which tend to concentrate on personal savings and finance. CDFIs lie on the boundary of what is currently understood to be charitable status, but the Charity Commission announced a new charitable purpose, ‘community capacity building’, in December 2000 and committed to developing clear guidelines on the charitability of CDFIs by the end of 2001. Current regulatory arrangements are assessed and it is found that, apart from credit unions, which have been brought under the supervisory wing of the Financial Services Authority, CDFIs tend to operate in a context of ‘benign neglect’. While recognising that heavy-handed regulation might stifle growth, it is argued that the downside of neglect could be uncertainty, which might also blight the development of the sector. An alternative, relatively liberal, regulatory framework is proposed, including self-regulation for the smaller institutions via associations. It is concluded that the type of regulation should vary with the size, status (mutual vs non mutual), and source of finance (deposits vs risk capital). © Henry Stewart Publications, 1358-1988.},

In descending order of importance these factors are: the co-operative form of organisation, contact personnel, in-store specials, responsiveness, communication policy, and price comparisons. Price comparisons with the products/services offered by competing retail stores were found to have a negative impact on the members’ assessments of value. Moreover, when comparing value judgements on the basis of the variables, education and number of years the respondents had been with the co-op, the results showed that the more educated the members were, the more likely they were to give feedback to the organisation. In addition, members that had been with the co-op for one to three years were more apt to believe that management would respond to their suggestions than the respondents who had been with the co-op for more than nine years. Implications for strategies that promise to create value and influence the members’ retention decisions are discussed. © 2001, MCB UP Limited},

The policy was disallowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1998, but revalidated by the U.S. Congress later that year. Allowing credit unions to attach multiple membership groups has contributed significantly to rapid growth in the industry. As credit unions add unrelated groups and expand, the prospects for separation between ownership and control increases, creating potential agency control problems. This potential is compounded by the one member, one vote governance structure of credit unions. This research finds empirical evidence that agency problems grow as credit unions add membership groups and members. If a credit union takes on more than one membership group, and as membership increases, management is apparently able to channel residual earnings away from members (in the form of higher net interest margins) toward itself (higher salaries and operating expenses). © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

These comparative advantages, however, are enhanced in small mutuals such as credit unions which focus on relatively small memberships with a common bond. The paper concludes by suggesting that although the credit union movement will not necessarily develop along similar lines to the building societies, it does have a future in providing banking facilities to the relatively poor and disenfranchised sectors of society.},

    abstract = {The objective of this study was to provide an economic assessment of site specific management (SSM) of P and K. The data were collected from 1993 to 1995 in farmer managed on-farm trials coordinated by Purdue University and DeKalb-Agra, a Waterloo, IN, agricultural input supply and marketing cooperative. Whole field management (WFM) was compared with SSM using either three acre grids or soil type for soil sampling and fertilizer recommendations. The data indicate that site specific P and K application on corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) did not reliably increase net returns. The main effect of the site specific P and K applications on physical quantities of fertilizer was to redistribute the nutrient applications within fields. Both grid and soil type treatments had lower net return standard deviations than WFM. Both mean-variance and stochastic dominance (SD) analyses indicate that the soil type approach dominated the WFM for risk averse decision makers.},

    abstract = {The context of agricultural cooperatives is undergoing major change with the development of various food and information monitoring technologies. Large multi-nationals have moved to take advantage of these developments with the construction of agri-food chains. These chains are being facilitated via various mergers, acquisitions, and alliances, with the power, and deepening power of such deep-pocket organizations as Cargill, ADM, and ConAgra. Cooperatives have been integrated into these chains for their core competencies, generally for their supply functions, and capacity to handle primary commodities. These direct links to the farmers serve as markets for biotechnology innovations, and as a source of raw material for later processing. Agricultural cooperatives in general are not well suited to compete with these giants, given they are highly specialized at the first handler level. However some cooperatives are able to enter the competition along the lines of multi-nationals competition, i.e. non-price competition in product differentiation, branding, advertising, research and capacity expansion. Farmland, Gold Kist, AGP, Land O'Lakes and Growmark are examples. The cost of these positionings is to shift these organizations toward positions that are characteristically less cooperative, and more bureaucratic, and more top down, though likely more efficient, and with greater market penetration.},

    abstract = {The results emanating from the study produce well-documented evidence that farm women have a close association with livestock farming in Tamil Nadu. These results tend to suggest a more active role for this segment of the rural society so as to achieve rural development through combining women and livestock development. In the light of these results, the following policy suggestions are made to fully and productively exploit the women-livestock linkage. (i) Channels of information, credit, inputs and access to markets have to be aimed at women as they played a very important role in livestock keeping and decisions related to livestock productions. (ii) The existing extension set-up working to promote livestock production in the rural areas has a typical social obstacle not being able to contact the farm women to extend transfer of technology. This difficulty poses problems for the extension wing to approach those who actually undertake and decide livestock production activities. This warrants positioning appropriate female frontline extension officers to interact and offer first hand information to the farm women. (iii) There is also the need for bringing the services available to rear the animals physically closer to women. (iv) In spite of the fact that there is a close and more productive association between farm women and livestock, women participation in training programmes have not been satisfactory, primarily due to the socioeconomic impediments that exist. Hence, efforts are the need of the hour to make appropriate measures to train the farm women in scientific management practices. (v) Promoting intensive livestock rearing in the rural areas may encourage the females to participate more in livestock keeping as this practice did not require farm women to take animals for grazing far away from home. And (vi) encouraging the formation of rural women livestock farmer's co-operative society may increase female participation in livestock rearing.},

The paper finds that Taiwan's local financial institutions are deeply embedded in the Kuomintang (KMT)-centered political economy, and are thus not easily subject to large-scale reforms. The ascension to power by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) since the 2000 presidential elections should pave the way for more serious reforms. Difficulties still abound, however.},

Although market orientation has been considered one of those critical resources, there is little understanding regarding how it is created and nurtured in business relationships. In the context of asymmetrical channel partnerships dominated by a downstream leader, in this paper we present a model where the upstream follower's market orientation is promoted as a consequence of the leader's use of authoritative mechanisms of coordination. Some hypotheses are presented and empirically tested in a sample of agricultural cooperatives that maintain channel partnerships with second-order marketing cooperatives. The results indicate that formalization, participation, input control, and behaviour control are coordination mechanisms that lead to improvements in market orientation. Implications for interorganisational theory and managerial activities are discussed at the end of the paper. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We examine trust along two dimensions: cognitive and affective. We argue that cognitive-based trust will be more salient in some contexts while affective-based trust will be more salient in other settings. Findings suggest that in both co-ops, trust among members and trust between members and co-op management are important predictors of group cohesion, which is a measure of the strength of members' desires to remain in a group (co-op) and their commitment to it. As hypothesized, there are differences in the effects of cognitive and affective trust, depending upon differences in the contexts represented by the two co-ops. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The tow key assumptions are constraints on lump-sum transfers from poorer members and dispro portionate control rights wielded by wealthier members. Transfers of rents to the latter are achieved by depressing prices paid for inputs supplied by members and diverting resulting retained earnings. The theory predicts that increased heterogeneity of landholdings in the local area causes increased inefficeincy by inducing a lower inputs price and a lower level of installed crushing capacity. Predictions concerning the effect of the distribution of local landownership on sugarcane price, capacity levels, and participation rates of different classes of farmers are confirmed by data from nearly 100 sugar cooperatives in the Indian state of Maharashtra over the period 1971-93.},

Identity formation unfolds in an arena characterized by competition for land based on differential access to various sources of power. Historical identities from the pre-communist past, the recent communist past, and those developed in western Germany during the period of separation all provide the basis for emerging identities. The logic and reality of this redefinition are embedded in wider political and economic interests that are themselves inconsistent and in flux.},

Using an approach at the junction of history and sociology, it considers the Desjardins movement as one of the components of what Alain Touraine calls a 'social development movement'.

Prior to our analysis of education and training, we first demonstrate the importance of cooperation in the Spanish olive oil sector. The thesis underlying this work is that the poor level of formal education and the lack of specific training represent a serious obstacle to the business development of these societies. After looking at the central problem of this study, we analyze the formal education of the various groups making up cooperatives (members, elected boards, managers and workers), as well as the specific training (offered by the firm itself or by other bodies), in terms of the number of courses attended or made available to the members. In this article we also pose the following question: are professionalization of the cooperative and education in cooperative values enough to solve the problem of management in cooperatives?

    abstract = {A concrete alternative economy has been developing in Brazil since the end of the 1980s, which involves both country and city workers and is based on the structuring of solidary economic enterprises (SEE), in which self-developed popular cooperatives stand out. This alternative economy has brought with it new challenges, among them the need for ongoing technical, administrative and political education as a fundamental element in the search for equilibrium between social and economic issues. This article analyzes the Solidary Economy in Brazil, particularly from the standpoint of the challenges faced by the cooperative agrarian reform of the Landless Rural Workers' Movement (MST). Starting from the historical process in which landless workers began to organize, agrarian cooperation has become an important tool for the workers' settlements. On the other hand, the reality of the capitalist economy has obliged cooperative workers to adopt administrative tools that contribute toward the social and economic viability of their enterprises. The backdrop to this issue is the need to deepen the debate about the possibility of conceiving SEEs that are capable of survival and growth in the capitalist economy, incorporating technical progress, rationalizing productive and work organization, bringing social benefits to their members, and acting as the political force behind the workers' struggles, as well as ensuring democratic and autonomous administration.},

Mallanahally TGCS, situated in the southern part of Karnataka state in India was selected and a survey was carried out. Benefit-cost ratios and internal rate of return are worked out for various situations.

    abstract = {Sound lending procedures in retail financial institutions involve identifying high-risk applicants, modifying loan conditions such as security requirements, and monitoring repayments post-loan approval. For managers of credit unions, this procedure is complicated by the need to achieve balance between the institution's social objective of improving loan accessibility so members can attain lifestyle goals and the possibility of reducing the institution's viability through loan default. The results of our survey of Australian credit unions, in which 70 per cent of respondents reported experiencing some bankruptcy-related default on personal loans, indicate managers do not impose more stringent lending conditions on high-risk borrowers. However, social and viability objectives could be better balanced through careful loan monitoring and timely arrears practices. © 2003, MCB UP Limited},

In addition, trust derived from a unique environment based on a village structure where a few families dwell not to mention "everyone knows each other well" has also become institutionalized. In this setting, a complex and multi-dimensional property rights could have developed. Moreover, the Confucian order, historically institutionalized in China, has differentiated the respective roles of the public from the private and the center from the local through a network intertwined by relationships (guanxi-based network), allowing them to be relatively autonomous from each other (embedded autonomy). This institutional tradition of the Chinese society has re-emerged with the coming of the reform age. The reform reintroduced the revival of the traditional family household, as a cooperative unit for the insiders and, at the same time, as a competitive unit against the outsiders; and its renewed close relationship with the local governments have given birth to the township village enterprises. Based on reforms of this nature, which have occurred from the bottom and approved by the center state ex post, China was able to experience the implementation a new form of transition to capitalism, i.e., rural industrialization. In this process, China's guana-based township-village enterprises were able to secure the fitness to react to market competition despite their collective ownership nature.},

    abstract = {In India, social forestry implies growing trees on private, community, or government non-forest land primarily for meeting the local community's basic needs of fuelwood, small wood, and fodder and for providing a supplementary source of income to tree growers and the rural poor. Although the practice of growing trees by the Indian farmers is as old as the cultivation of crops, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 first articulated the need for government involvement in this activity on a significant scale. Consequently, social forestry projects were started by many of the State Governments in India in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Later, the National Forest Policy of 1988 also emphasised the role of social forestry as a source of raw materials for forest-based industries. This paper attempts to describe and evaluate three of the social forestry development models, namely, the State Forest Departments (SFD) model; the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) model; and the Tree Growers' Co-operative Societies (TGCS) model. Each model is presented briefly and illustrated through a case study. The evaluation is done using the criteria of efficiency, sustainability, equity, and people's participation. First, a brief presentation of each of the three models is given and then an evaluation of each model is attempted. The paper is mainly based on the research work done by the author and partly on the work done by the other researchers.},

The proposed test is implemented with data for the Irish dairy-processing sector. The findings suggest that Irish co-operatives behaved “as if” they were profit maximizers, and we could find no evidence that this behavior coincided with postulated co-operative pricing rules. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the economic impact of the EU dairy quota on the Irish dairy-processing sector. We also discuss the emergence of Public Limited Companies (PLCs) as the dominant organizational structure in the Irish dairy sector. [JEL citations: D21; Q13.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While the paper briefly presents the organizational structure, membership, financial status of the society, the main objective of the paper is to highlight the salient features that have led to its success. The declining yield in the farmer's fields as a result of waterlogging and salinity is referred to highlight the need for drainage in the area. Evidence is presented to show that implementation of drainage will strengthen the financial position of the society since it is linked with the financial position of its members. The society is keen to takeover the small drainage infrastructure created and if appropriate funds and institutional support is available, to expand this activity. If the society takes over the project upon withdrawal of government support, this society would be the only one that would truly show the concept of irrigation and drainage go together being handled by a single society.},

    abstract = {During surveys conducted in the fields at village Siar in district Ludhiana of Punjab, India, crops were found infested with four rodent species, namely, Bandicota bengalensis, Rattus maltada, Tatera indica and Mus spp. Survey of rodent control practices by farmers revealed that farmers (n=20) carry out rodent control as a regular practice but 80% of them, depending upon the level of damage to crops, conduct symptomatic control treatments with zinc phosphide. However, in general they expressed dissatisfaction about the effectiveness of zinc phosphide baiting for which the major causes were found to be the lack of pre-baiting, use of incorrect methods of bait preparation, multiple baitings of zinc phosphide at short intervals and non-removal of left over rodenticide bait and dead rodents after the treatments leading to poison-bait shyness and individual rather than campaign approach to rodent control. Village level training and field demonstrations organized with the help of three organizations of the village, namely, the Pendu Vikas Ate Mulazam Bhalai Sanstha Sangh, the Siar Pandher Co-operative Society and the Gram Panchayat, to an assembly of about fifty farmers resulted in partial success as determined on the basis of post-training survey of these parameters from a sample of 20 farmers in adoption of regular rodent control at recommended timings (45%) and pre-baiting before the use of zinc phosphide (25%) with correct method of bait preparation (60%). However, only three farmers (15%) treated rodents in the uncultivated and wasteland areas adjoining their crop fields and only one (5%) organized rodent control on large areas along with his neighbours. No farmer could be convinced for removing left over rodenticide bait and dead rodents from the fields after the treatments. Farmer's field demonstration trials were carried out at four fields each of 7.5 hectare size in different blocks of the village. Rodenticide treatments under experts' supervision in the fields designated as maintenance (M) fields resulted in 94.94% rodent control with 0.005% bromadiolone followed by 2% zinc phosphide baiting in rice fields and 85.42% with 2% zinc phosphide followed by 0.0375% Racumin baiting in wheat fields. With the absence of the expert during the treatment in N1 fields with free supply of rodenticide and education and training, rodent control success decreased non-significantly which further decreased significantly without the free supply of rodenticides as in N2 fields both during the kharif and rabi seasons. The reference fields (R) had more rodent damage than in the treated fields. This comparative study revealed that for success of rodent control at farmer's fields not only the education and training of the farmers but the availability of the rodenticides are the critical factors.},

Judged against participation rates for women in the labor market and in specific organizations such as trade unions, the study suggests that gender balance in credit unions is superior to that elsewhere in Irish society. There is, however, some evidence of gender imbalance in the composition of credit union boards with this being most visible for key decision-making positions such as Chair and Vice-Chair. It also emerges that gender imbalance becomes more pronounced for larger credit unions supporting the contention that women are found in greater numbers on small and less well-connected not-for-profit boards.},

A female also lacks incentives to reduce her companions' reproduction, because her own survival and reproduction depend on group territoriality and synchronous breeding. Consequently, female relationships are highly symmetrical, and female lions are "free agents" who only contribute to communal care when they have cubs of their own.},

The women's cooperatives managed to professionalize their part-time work. They created a source of income for rural women and gave them independence, power of control and self-esteem. Furthermore, the cooperatives resulted in placing the localities, in which they were established, on the Greek map of "alternative tourism".},

The organisational form of a marketing co-operative is a common means adopted by farmers to achieve this end. In a world increasingly concerned with the importance of the separation of ownership and user, the survival and growth of agricultural co-operatives (in which the primary users of the services are also the main owners) is linked to their economic role, to how members exercise their property rights, and how inputs are used by the co-operative. This paper provides a function that summarises the economic role of agricultural co-operatives and goes on to analyse the contribution to the economic performance of Portuguese wine co-operatives (PWCs) made by the use of property rights, and the skills of the human resources and technology employed. The results of a multinomial logit model show that PWCs would indeed be able to improve their economic performance through the application of integrated management strategies to solve common property and horizon problems, as well as increasing their recruitment of skilled professionals in the areas of management, wine production and marketing, and by the adoption of new technologies of production and packaging. © 2002 CIRIEC.},

Examination of resources from the party archives, journals and newspapers reveals debates between hard-liners and reformers on the structure and implementation of collective farm policies, and illustrates how the early 1950s reform programme reappeared in the post-revolutionary period through the 1957 Agrarian Theses and framed the debate over a new course for Hungarian agriculture. The resulting collectivization programme represented a compromise between hardliners and reformers, emphasizing collectivization and including aspects of the Agrarian Theses, such as agricultural investment incentives and the promise of a higher quality of life.},

    abstract = {In the post-World War II era, nation-states have been sufficiently curbed in their individualistic pursuit of goals and payoffs by the proliferation of international organizations IOs and regimes and the internalization of international norms and rules by domestic societies. The modern nation-state has undergone significant changes both in terms of its purpose and sovereignty. States have traditionally been based on territorial factors. Increasingly, however, state participation in the global economy has led to the former's integration with the latter and, consequently, an increased degree of interdependence among states. The result has been the rise of trading states which measure themselves by their relative shares of the global economy and not by territorial size or military power. The pervasiveness of economic interdependence has constrained both internal and external aspects of state sovereignty. States must harmonize internal policies to conform to the requirements of international institutions and regimes. In addition, the growing power of domestic actors has forced decision makers to take greater cognizance of the domestic audience, and has led to the phenomenon of two-level game, in which domestic considerations impact on international relations and vice-versa. At the same time, participation in IOs and regimes constrain a state's external sovereignty by limiting policy choices and enforcing compliance with international obligations. This erosion of the traditional conceptions of state sovereignty has been accelerated by a combination of the increased power of international regimes and domestic forces, and the increased mobility of capital and labour. These factors have led to the development of what Richard Rosecrance has termed the virtual state. But as this combination of factors has constrained state sovereignty in several areas, it has also augmented the power of the state in other spheres. The member-state has evolved as an enhanced nation-state that has access to greater resources than any political unit had in the past, with the exception of the empire. Significantly, unlike the empire, the member-state has the means to retain the loyalty of its citizenry. Further, in exchange for the constraints placed upon individual states by international regimes and the global economy, states have greater access to private goods, capital and labour, and public goods such as the free market. Cooperative efforts between states also produce enhanced capabilities and greater relative gains. The process of harmonization between states' domestic norms and rules and international norms and rules has provided domestic actors with justification to pursue what might otherwise be unpopular domestic programmes.},

There are various problems such as: (i) lack of resources of the societies and non-repayment of loans by its members, (ii) corruption of office-bearers, (iii) competition from and manipulation of fish merchants, (iv) centralisation of power with the Registrar of the cooperative societies and, (v) political and administrative interference. One factor which is required for success of cooperatives, viz., small and homogenous group whose member enjoy a high level of equality in their socio-economic status, is found among the fishermen of Chilika. So, the success of cooperatives largely depends on their independence from the interference of government officials. Of course, cooperatives including PFCSs require constitutional protection to be an effective rural financial institution and to be an independent organisation. In short, there is need for democratising, deofficialising and depoliticising the cooperative movement.},

For members of the cooperative, we assume decentralized decision-making behavior, i.e., Nash-Cournot behavior, (1) following a recent contribution (Albæk and Schultz). Using this approach, we consider first an open membership policy with homogeneous members and then we address the issue of heterogeneous membership. We introduce producers that are heterogeneous in terms of efficiency, and the question we address is whether more efficient producers would prefer to join a cooperative or to sell their commodity to an alternative venue, i.e., to the investor-owned firm. We believe this is an important line of research, once one recognizes that members look at different outside opportunities and market outlets when not satisfied with their returns from the cooperative. Our research investigates the effects of endogeneous membership and heterogeneity on members' and cooperatives' behavior.},

The fruit processing co-operative was found to be on a sustained growth path with constantly increasing business turnover, sales and profits. The healthy and sound financial ratios were the pointers of success that can be further improved through increasing processing capacity, diversifying the range of processed products, inculcating skilled management and financial prudence and expanding market avenues. The leadership qualities, confidence/capacity building, business acumen and educational values that Samridhi has inculcated among the hapless and backward womenfolk must be encouraged and emulated to change the face of rural economy.},

The association's services include the pooling of produce to meet the requirements of large buyers such as supermarkets, directing EU subsidies to improve farm production and move into higher-value crop production, and accessing crop loans. ASSOFRUIT includes a few very large farmers who continue to market some of their produce themselves, and this is seen to benefit the association as a whole. The large farmers' knowledge about prices, market outlets and new opportunities are passed on to the association. The association's success is also attributed to the dynamism of the management team, which is always looking out for new projects for which it can secure funding.},

Results confirm the previously observed role of market structure and strongly point to a significant role for credit unions in disciplining the exercise of market power by banks. At the institution level, where the impact of bank size, market share, and holding company status can be analyzed, the evidence supports both market power and scale economy rationales for bank loan pricing and hints at a multimarket contact influence.},

    abstract = {Since the early 1980s, privately owned Savings and Credit Co-operative Societies (SACCS) have grown rapidly in Swaziland because commercial loans are either inaccessible or too costly, while public financial agencies failed to deliver the services needed by small borrowers (Matsebula, 1996). SACCS serve a wide range of clients including the poor and the self-employed as well as formal sector employees, and have shown a potential to enhance financial and economic development in the country. They provide insurance cover as well as non-exclusive starting loans to small enterprises that may eventually gain access to bigger bank loans to finance expansion. Such 'linking strategies have the potential of overcoming problems of formal banks in replicating the techniques of informal financial intermediaries as well as the lack of resources among the informal or semi-formal financial sectors which preclude them from serving their clients on a large scale' (Schoombee, 1998:354). In the linking process, semi-formal financial intermediaries may assist banks in the monitoring, supervision and recovery of loans (Sanderatne, 1992). The study utilises survey data covering a sample of six societies, and argues that the SACCS' organisational structures, operating mechanisms, staff training and regulatory and advisory assistance from the Swaziland Association of Savings and Credit Co-operative Societies are the key factors for success. The article is organised as follows. Background information on the evolution and economic significance of SACCS in Swaziland is followed by an analysis of the survey data, focusing on their outreach and financial viability. The reasons for their success and the story of one society (Asikhutulisane) are then analysed before summarising the findings.},

This paper demonstrates that such a governance rule may enhance the survival of such organizational forms in the face of adverse incentives created by accumulated financial surpluses and identifies factors that may prompt conversion to a joint-stock form. The analysis is based on noting that current members collectively have "inherited" accumulated surpluses of the cooperative from past members. Older members have an incentive to extract maximum personal private benefit from that inheritance by voting to convert from a cooperative to a joint stock company, even though such an outcome may be socially suboptimal. A simple overlapping generations model is used to develop a "sustainability constraint," which must be met if conversion is not to occur and examine how a one-member/one-vote governance rule contributes to the survival of the institution in a cooperative form.},

Most importantly, average net income increased by more than 100% from $260/ha to $549/ha after transfer. Very high financial self-sufficiency ratios coupled with low running cost achieved by the farmers' co-operative led to the conclusion that transfer has resulted in better performance so far.},

    abstract = {The governments in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia considered privatization the most important prerequisite for higher efficiency in the agricultural sector. The privatization process of the former state and collective farms, thousands of hectares in size, has been implemented predominantly by way of decollectivization, restitution and compensation as well as by direct privatization following decomposition into smaller entities. This procedure, though leading to a fragmentation of ownership, has not resulted in fragmented operation here, due to the dominance of new market-conforming smaller cooperatives and other types of corporations. In addition, most new small owners leased their land to the new agricultural cooperatives, though currently the share of small-scale farming especially in Hungary is growing. These new entities, extending over hundreds of hectares, have been mostly owned by managers holding important positions already in the previous political regime and thus experienced in large-scale operation. Consequently the old-new management is able to cope with the new circumstances in the transformed farms, which are still large enough to utilize economies of scale in production. Altogether, over 90% of the agricultural land in the CEFTA is now in private hands. Other crucial reform steps related to farming were massive cuts in agrarian subsidies and the liberalization of agro-food markets and of prices as well. Although the bulk of the institutional transformation of CEFTA agriculture has been completed, problems still to be solved are constituted mainly by the lack of market institutions such as a credit system related to the land market. The urgently needed existence of the land market would generate land prices that can serve as a guideline for borrowers and lenders regarding feasible mortgage values.},

    abstract = {This paper traces the origins and progress of a small grass-roots local environmental initiative. From the simple desire of a few people to clean up some waste land behind their homes grew the Plumstead Common Environment Group. Working closely with the local Borough Council, the group has obtained funding from English Nature, Shell Better Britain Campaign, the Co-operative Society, local businesses and residents. It has expanded its remit from less than 1 ha to over 50 ha of public open space within an older, high-density housing area in Greater London. The important feature of this project is the balance it manages to achieve between a number of potentially competing needs. These include the needs of local people to have a degree of control over, and be practically involved in, the improvement of their immediate environment; to have feedback in terms of aesthetic improvements; and to conserve/enhance the ecological value of the area. Failure to maintain this balance can undermine the viability of such projects. The ways in which the project has addressed ethical, aesthetic and ecological considerations are outlined, serving as an exemplar of sound community-based environmental practice for urban ecological projects elsewhere.},

    abstract = {A stated objective of the Ethiopian Government since it came to power in 1975 has been to increase the production of crops for both domestic consumption and export. Consequently, a number of plans and programs have been proposed and implemented to bring about such development in Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro review of the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land reform of 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the population growth as evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production (1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further deteriorated. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable for agriculture, but only about 19% is cultivated. This suggest an underutilisation of land. Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and education which are essential to development have not been given due attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural technologies used by farmers have changed little in this century. Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most potent economic force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from the central government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total agricultural credit, fertiliser and improved seeds respectively go directly to socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5% of the total cultivated land and 4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises with credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting smallholders, has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in Ethiopia. Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no significant development of agriculture in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform. © 1991.},

    abstract = {Abstract.  In order to assess the attitudes of fish farmers towards data management, and discover the major sources of influence upon planning production, a postal survey among 293 salmon and trout farmers was conducted in the summer of 1987. The degree of microcomputer use and the uptake of automation were examined in this perspective. Salmon and trout fanners collected production records which, in most cases, were unsuitable for planning. Microcomputers were used mainly for accounting and word processing. Software was commonly purchased‘off‐the‐shelf’. Computerization when rejected was primarily on grounds of excessive costs and time requirements. Other automation comprised feeding systems and to a lesser extent water parameter monitoring. For decision making, directors and owners relied heavily on their site managers and foremen to provide feedback. When farms were members of marketing cooperatives or owned by larger firms the latter directed their production and outlets. Accountants were employed part‐time to draw the financial accounts, and the proportion of fish farms hiring experts and computer consultants was small. The findings showed that information technology is not a priority among fish farm managers. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Because this form requires little initial capital investment (which enables local control and self-development) and can be developed in a way that allows for non-economic goals, it can be an important element of sustainable tourism. This article uses qualitative case study analysis and in-depth interviews to examine if the various rationalities within three tourism craft marketing cooperatives in central Appalachia are manifest in their contributions made to the communities in which they are located.The study is theoretically framed by the Weberian concept of formal and substantive rationality. Formal rationality is based on economic goals only, while substantive rationality allows for non-economic goals like improved quality of life and cultural preservation. Results indicate the Weberian framework is a useful device for interpreting whether a tourism-related marketing cooperative organisation's internal goals and priorities are manifest in its external contributions to community. This study is especially useful to rural tourism practitioners interested in maximising often scarce resources in a sustainable manner that maintains local control and ideologies. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

If the productivity gains from decollectivisation were due mainly to eliminating the incentive problems of collective farms, how the initial collectivisation could also have been associated with gains in productivity presents a major historical puzzle. We suggest as an answer the possibility that agricultural production in China was widely organised on a household basis until 1958, despite the collectivisation of property rights, and that the formation of the agricultural producers' co-operatives reduced the inefficiencies in factor allocation that existed following China's land reform.},

This article attempts to consider some of the theoretical and practical implications of this growing role by treating them as ‘value‐driven’ organizations, and asking how this differentiates them, in terms of efficiency and accountability, from public or private agencies. It notes the lack of developed theoretical models capable of dealing with this question, and examines the relevance of existing theories (neo‐classical economics, public administration and especially varieties of organization theory including the New Institutional Economics) in dealing with agencies which claim to be dominated by motivations based on democracy and altruism rather than self‐interest. The author looks at problems associated with the measurement of efficiency and enforcement of accountability in organizational life and at the need for effective incentives and sanctions which provide a stable basis for maintaining commitment. He then considers the issues involved in the enforcement of accountability to ensure the efficient use of resources in producer co‐operatives on the one hand and service delivery NGOs on the other. In the former, the focus is on the strengths and weaknesses of market competition and the costs of collective management; in the latter on the varied relationships between ‘principals and agents' involved in the production and management of services. © 1993 Institute of Social Studies},

We use the example of cooperatives and producer marketing boards in the main agricultural export industries of New Zealand to inform this debate. Regulation by central government has been crucial to the establishment and continuance of producer marketing boards, especially in the face of substantial neoliberal criticism of their very existence. Critics of producer marketing boards - the New Zealand Department of Treasury, nonfarm capitals, and one corporate agriculturalist - argue on the basis of theoretical efficiency, but offer little empirical evidence. Using insights from the family farm and cooperation literatures, we argue that cooperatives and producer marketing boards help shield family farms from the full costs of market relations, assist shareholders in capturing downstream profits, enable farmers to develop and maintain ownership of new technology, reduce competition among farmers, and allow farmers more control of their industries than would otherwise be the case.},

    abstract = {Vietnam's policies to establish a market economy are reshaping the state organizations and agricultural cooperatives that have operated and maintained irrigation systems. The new policies emphasize financial autonomy for state enterprises, and a shift in the responsibilities of the agricultural cooperatives away from collective production activities. Specific policies and institutional arrangements vary considerably among the provinces. In Quang Nam-Da Nang province in central Vietnam, the agricultural cooperatives generally still play an important role in irrigation O&M at the tertiary and quaternary level, serving as intermediaries between individual households and the state enterprise that operates the headworks and the primary and secondary canal network of government irrigation schemes. The cooperatives also have full responsibility for many small pump irrigation schemes. The state irrigation enterprises have partial financial autonomy, financing their activities primarily from irrigation fees collected from the farmers. The power to set the fees, however, resides with the provincial government and not with the irrigation enterprises. The fee, which is an area-based fee differentiated by crop and season, is set in terms of paddy to facilitate maintaining its real value in the face of inflation. Both cost and equity factors are taken into consideration in setting the schedule of fees. The fees in government gravity irrigation schemes are fairly high by comparison with other Asian countries; however they are lower than typically paid by farmers in the small pump irrigation schemes operated by the agricultural cooperatives. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

An attractive alternative is the producer cooperative, where employment is accompanied by a right to democratic participation in organizational governance and a share of surplus earnings. A comparative theoretical analysis of cooperative and profit-maximizing corporate behavior suggests that cooperatives will tend to use natural resource inputs more efficiently and will be less growth oriented than corporations. The limited comparative empirical research that is available supports the greater input efficiency of cooperatives relative to corporations. This same research suggests that in fully employed economies, cooperatives will be less growth oriented than corporations, although where unemployment is substantial the reverse is likely.

    abstract = {Marketing cooperatives are common in agricultural markets. This article explores their price and welfare effects and relates to antitrust legislation in the United States, the European Union some of the EU member states-in particular, Sweden. Welfare is higher with a monopoly cooperative than with a profit-maximizing monopoly, if the scope for price discrimination is small and if the world-market price is low relative to the domestic price. As the world-market price rises (or as price discrimination becomes more important), the welfare effect is reversed. The price-discrimination effect suggests that, as a marketing cooperative integrates vertically, welfare may fall. These results carry over to a duopoly with a cooperative firm and a profit-maximizing firm. In such a duopoly, the cooperative behaves more aggressively and obtains a larger market share. Empirical evidence supports these conclusions. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The defects arise from the use of unitary boards which introduce conflicts of interest for directors and reduces both their ability and incentive to improve operational performance. The use of supervisory boards and stakeholder councils to decentralise control, provides a basis for improving the operational performance of directors and their organisation. Also, stakeholder participation provides a way to convert ‘open’ hierarchies into several decentralised ‘closed loop’ information and control systems to improve operating performance. Practical examples are found in Japanese keiretsu firms, the employee/consumer co-operatives found around the town of Mondragón in Spain and in the governance of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. This paper considers the opportunities for public and private sector organisations using Anglo-Saxon corporate architecture to improve their performance, social accountability and competitiveness by introducing stakeholder governance. © 1993, lOS B.Y.},

All four RFIs have applied positive interest rates. All four RFIs have offered some savings services. Notable differences among the RFIs also exist. The four RFIs reviewed can be classified in two distinct groups based on average loan and deposit size, and also with respect to the targeted clientele. Hence the level of outreach achieved has differed among RFIs, as has the level of women's participation.

The fixed effects are found to be significant and important, but can be only partly explained by observed cooperative attributes. This provides another support to the Monte Carlo results of Borjas and Sueyoshi, that controlling for group effects is superior to alternative models. The results also imply that unobserved factors have considerable effects on farmers' time allocation, and hence should be controlled for whenever possible.},

This article demonstrates that stronger institutional linkages between local offices of the All-China Women's Federation and the ICCIC encourage the growth of women's co-operative activities. It raises two sets of policy issues that are central to the development of co-operatives and women's banking: the continued growth of these activities will depend upon the government adopting legislation to define the legal framework governing co-operative relations and management systems, and establishing gender-inclusive policies to increase credit to women's income-generating activities.},

    abstract = {Since the 1970s dam construction in the rural areas of South Korea has formed a major part of government works. This has contributed greatly to the control of water resources, but has also resulted in many involuntary or forced migrations of people from inundated areas. In many studies of the villages lost to dam construction, whether undertaken by geographers, cultural anthropologists, or folklorists, the central concern has been on the ethnology of the former settlement and on the pattern of removal. Other important aspects such as the process of re-settlement, adaption and acculturation of the migrants to their new homes have so far tended to be overlooked. This paper explores the re-settlement process, adaptive strategies, and acculturation of a migrant clan in South Korea. Steward's (1955) cultural core model is applied with respect to the adaptation of migrants to their new communities. The study area is the village of Ilsun-ri in Heapyung-myun, Sunsan County, Kyungpook Province. This village was occupied by migrants from the Chonju Ryu clan in 1987, with most of them coming from several clan villages which were lost in the course of construction of the Imha Dam. Particular attention was paid in this study to villagers from Musil, a native place of the Chonju Ryu clan. Fieldwork took the form of participant observation during January and February, 1991. At that time there were 66 households in Ilsun-ri, and the population was 192. In Section II the cognative structure of the villagers is outlined, followed in Sections III-IV by an examination of villagers occupations, customs, and their adaptive mechanism to their new environment. The main features of this adaptation process can be summarized as follows: These migrants made a collective decision to move in the hope that cultural shock would be lessened and the homogeneity of the clan would be maintained. Since the family heads were mostly middle-aged, and ranked in economic terms in the 'middle-class', the group adapted well to their new milieux. Before migration the Chonju Ryu villagers depended on subsistence agriculture, using manual labour and farm animals, for their livelihood. After migration, the villagers had to cope with many changes in agricultural environment, including climate and quality of arable land. They were also introduced to farm mechanization and improved methods of transportation. It was therefore necessary to switch to production of commercial crops in order for them to remain economically self-reliant. Accordingly, the traditional pattern of labour exchange transformed into one of functional cooperation. Also, some villagers became free to seek employment at the nearby Kumi industrial complex. As a result, the life style of the villagers has become more varied after the migration. Despite these changes, the villagers were able to maintain their traditional ancestral worship practices and Confucian value system. For example, the villagers brought with them symbolic buildings and structures, such as Chongga, Sadang, and Chongja, to set up in the new village. These structures were re-erected in the same spatial arrangement as in the old village, giving full regard to the geomantic traditions of Pung-su and their positions relative to the surrounding mountains and rivers. All this can be viewed as a kind of defensive reaction to new external influences and surrounds, but it is also clear that a necessary part of the villagers adaptive strategy was affirmation of their common ancestral heritage. Finally, it is clear that while the migrants accommodated rapidly the new agricultural technologies and methods of cooperative organization, they maintained many cultural factors related to clan identity. Although the former spirit of cooperation and internal cohesion outwardly appears to have weakened in the village, the migrants have displayed an adaptive mechanism of selective acceptance of new things, while preserving much that reflects the clans identity. These conclusions suggest the Steward cultural core model, which presumes complete acculturation takes place over time, does not fit precisely with the situation described here. © 1997, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

Their development has been shaped by their close ties with local governments and communities. However, as marketization processes dissolve these links, the increasing competitive pressures of the 1990s make the search for new forms of enterprise organization a priority. The shareholding cooperative system (SCS) has been proposed as a method of strengthening enterprise autonomy whilst preserving the predominance of public ownership, and of improving enterprise efficiency by tying performance to profitabilty whilst maintaining some principles of equity. In practice, the new opportunities opened up by reform are often monopolized by those already in positions of wealth and power: local governments and individual entrepreneurs. But workers and local farmers may also become more directly involved in enterprise ownership, gaining a greater say in decision-making. In these cases, the SCS resembles a multi-stakeholder cooperative in which workers, managers, local governments and local farmers negotiate around their stakes in the future of the enterprise.},

We build a model of credit cooperatives designed to provide monitoring incentives and test this using nineteenth century data. © 1994 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

    abstract = {A large share of the agricultural cooperatives currently operating in both the European Union and North America have attributes that coincide with the characteristics of the traditional cooperative model - open membership societies, collective ownership, equal voting power, principles of equality and solidarity, ideological motivation, etc. This cooperative model is, however, constructed for making cooperative business efficient under specific economic conditions, viz., when the average cost curve is continually declining with size (economies of scale) and when the sales price is unaffected by the individual firm's sales volume, either due to agricultural policy or as the firm's supplies are small compared to the size of the market. As these conditions become less and less prevalent in today's business world, a growing number of agricultural cooperatives are abandoning the traditional cooperative model. Instead, a new cooperative model is evolving: The primary and secondary processing operations are organizationally separated, increasing the cooperatives' chances for forward integration in the processing chain. The primary processing is conducted within increasingly larger cooperative societies - some of them even internationally operating. The trade between the cooperative and its members becomes more and more business-like - for example, the cooperative gets more control with the farmers' production, and the farmers get more direct, individualized ownership to the cooperative. The secondary processing is done in private limited companies, owned jointly by the agricultural cooperatives, the farmer members and external investors, and these firms' business conduct resemble that of investor-owned firms.},

Critical determinants are the proportion of landowners who attempt to create family farms, the pace of creation of new private producer cooperatives or farming companies, the relationship between farm size and productivity and the variables which strengthen or weaken this relationship. The discussion suggests that even after land reform the major share of land and output will remain on a relatively small number of larger farms, and, provided appropriate market incentives exist, the expected gains in technical efficiency from a less polarized farm structure will be reinforced by other factors including labour market, credit and technical change. Productivity in Bulgarian agriculture has the capacity to increase as a result of the land reform. Thus with the same resources there could be an increase in output, relieving worries about security of food supplies. © 1993.},

These unsustainable practices, coupled with an underfunded, understaffed, and in the fishers' experience, usually uncooperative Fisheries Department makes enforcement of state-level fisheries laws next to impossible.

    abstract = {Cuba's agriculture after the 1959 revolution had been based on large-scale, capital intensive monoculture, which made Cuba heavily dependent on the socialist bloc for subsidized agrichemical inputs and for set prices of agricultural exports. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies in 1989–90, Cuba's inputs of fertilizer, pesticides, and petroleum dropped by more than half Cuba responded with a dramatic shift in its agricultural development model that featured appropriate technology, alternative organization of labor, alternative planning, and environmental preservation. Cuban pest control efforts now focus on biological control and on enhanced monitoring and diagnostic techniques. Soil management emphasizes biofertilizers and vermiculture. Minimum tillage and crop rotation are frequent practices among Cuba's independent farmers, agricultural cooperatives, and state farms. The transition to low-input agriculture has decreased the exodus of people from rural areas to cities, and has lead to establishment of lab or camps with volunteer labor and long-term programs for rebuilding rural communities. To address the loss of important food imports while ensuring environmental conservation, agricultural planning now gives priority to crop rotations, city gardens, and introduction of food crops in sugar cane areas. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

It can support an annual yield of 81‐5‐1081 and a catch rate of 11.4kg/ha/h. Out of the 28 species present in the river, the most abundant were Clarias gariepinus (Butchell), Schilbe mystus (L.), Synodontis afrofischeri (Hilgend), Oreochromis variabilis (Boulenger), O. leucostictus (Trewavas), and Lates niloticus (L.), Micropterus salmoides (Lacepède) and L. niloticus are a new development in the river fishery introduced respectively from the highland areas and Lake Victoria. The yield in the river has been reduced from 668t in 1959 to the current 108t and species available replaced the once abundant Barbus altianalis (Boulenger) and Labeo victorianus (Boulenger). This drastic reduction in yield can be attributed to overfishing, habitat degradation and poor management. The upstream migration of the river fishes extends as far as 10km from the Lake Victoria river‐mouth. The period of peak reproductive activity (March‐June and October‐November) coincides with the established rainy seasons in the region. The top ranking food items of the fishes are terrestrial and aquatic insects, vegetable matter, detritus, crustaceans, molluscs, fish, plankton and grit. The endemic fish stock appears to be in a depressed state, showing signs of overexploitation, and therefore careful stocking programmes to restore the fish balance would be appropriate. Fishing effort in the river should be regulated by licensing of nets and the minimum size of fish landed should be regulated through cooperative societies, clans, party elders and other social organizations.

    abstract = {The objective of this article is to examine the effects of the institutional setup on the time allocation of farmers. I investigate Israeli cooperative villages (Moshavim) that implement cooperative ideology differentially. Not working off the farm used to be part of that ideology. However, by 1981 most farm households had at least one adult member working off the farm. The fraction of off-farm workers varied considerably across cooperatives. Institutional structure can affect time-allocation decisions in several ways. First, there might be an explicit constraint or an implicit penalty on off-farm work. Second, stronger cooperatives (in the sense of having a more effective central management) may enhance the profitability of farming and, hence, indirectly induce members to work more on the farm and less off the farm. Both cooperative strength and ideological commitment are hypothesized to affect time allocation in the same way, namely, to reduce off-farm work and increase farm work. I test this hypothesis by examining the effects of cooperative attributes that proxy for these features on farmers' on-farm and off-farm labor-supply functions. This article emphasizes the effects of the institutional setup. Although it uses data on farm households in a relatively developed agricultural sector (Moshavim in Israel), the findings are perhaps more relevant to developing countries in which institutional constraints on the choices of farmers are more abundant. J. M. Guttman and N. Haruvi studied off-farm work participation rates in Moshavim and related them to the level of cooperation, using village-level variables. In contrast, in this study I explicitly model individual behavior and control for personal, family, and farm attributes. In addition, this article adds another dimension to the existing literature by estimating the off-farm labor-supply function jointly with the on-farm labor-supply function. This has been done before, mostly with respect to participation decisions. Since on-farm and off-farm labor supply are strongly negatively correlated, a joint estimation yields more efficient estimates. The institutional structure of Moshavim and its effect on time allocation are discussed in the following section. Next, I briefly review the theory of time allocation in farm households and discuss the comparative statics of the institutional structure. After that, I describe the data set, develop the empirical model, and report the estimation results. I find that in stronger and more ideologically committed cooperatives, farmers work less off the farm and more on the farm. The article concludes with a summary of the findings and their relevance.},

    abstract = {This paper discusses the debate around structural adjustment and African agriculture, the history of the Tanzanian cotton sector and farming systems in the main cotton growing area of the country before reporting the results of a small survey of cultivators carried out at the end of the 1997/8 seed cotton marketing season. This survey, carried out in the fourth year of market liberalisation, covered crop sales, farming methods, marketing behaviour and perceptions of the marketing system. The survey's main findings were as follows: Firstly, while there was almost certainly a substantial production response in 1995/6 over 1994/5 (for both official production statistics and survey data reported here on shares of cultivated area under cotton in 1995/6 show a big increase on comparable material for 1994), there is no evidence that this response has been subsequently amplified as liberalisation has continued and as monetisation of cotton sales has been institutionalised. Neither official production statistics nor average shares of cultivated area under cotton or average cotton sales as reported here show an increase over the period 1995/6 to 1997/8. In fact they show a decline of production and sales in 1997/8. Secondly, while the decline in 1997/8 was mainly the result of adverse weather conditions, the underlying failure for production to grow is based on a failure to shift toward more optimal farming methods, and a significant decline in non-labour input use. The latter follows a monetisation of inputs supply. It remains to be seen if input use will also flatten out as this monetisation process becomes institutionalised. In any event, a recovery in input use seems unlikely. Thirdly, primary cooperative societies are currently retaining very sizeable seed cotton market shares, despite offering inferior prices to private traders' ones and despite having curtailed the supply of inputs on favourable terms. This is partly based on their retention of effective monopolies in certain geographical areas. But they are also surviving in areas of high competition on the basis of the loyalty of a segment of the peasantry. Their ability to retain market share seems likely to weaken as the years pass, since with credit-based input supply no longer being undertaken, loyalty will lose most of its rationale. In addition, cooperatives may experience falling purchases as a result of failures of liquidity and a further decline in price competitiveness. Fourthly, possession of land and cattle, areas under cotton cultivation, cotton sales volumes, membership of primary cooperative societies and marketing behaviour are all socially stratified along lines of oxen ownership/non-ownership. Social stratification is partly attenuated however, most notably as a result of the heterogeneous character of oxen owners as a group. The relationship between socio-economic stratification and some of the attributes discussed above is an interesting one. The group which is best off with regard to land and cattle, has the largest areas under cotton cultivation and the highest cotton sales volumes also has the highest membership of cooperatives and ostensibly the least commercially-oriented marketing behaviour. This pattern dates to the period when cooperatives were important providers of external resources and were thus subject to efforts by better-off groups to control them. Fifthly, little or no differentiation of farming methods according to the described pattern of social stratification could be detected. Apart from differences arising from the possession/non-possession of oxen themselves (i.e., concerning methods of land preparation) the rural upper strata farmed in more or less exactly the same way as the lower one. Liberalisation of marketing in Tanzanian agriculture has (re-) accelerated commodification but has not disturbed the essentially extensive forms it reverted to during the 1980s. This tendency in turn reflects not only the 'embeddedness' of certain farming systems, but - as will be explored in subsequent papers - deregulation of markets in forms which exclusively reward quantity of output and which systematically mitigate deficiencies in output quality.},

    abstract = {This paper reviews the planning and city building processes in Delhi in three periods - the imperial Mughal, the imperial British and the post-Independence. In the two earlier periods, the plans followed the ideals and tastes of the ruling elites and the cities were built to meet their needs. But the cities were well adapted to the technologies of the times and patterns of social interactions among the residents. Consequently, they provided to most of their residents a living environment which was efficient, healthy and satisfying. One reason for this was that Delhi was a relatively small city and increase in population was slow. The half century since 1941 has witnessed an unprecedented increase in population which has gone up from less than 700,000 in 1941 to 8.4 million in 1991. The increase has been due partly in response to expansion of employment in public administration, trade, finance and manufacturing industries, and partly to large in-migration of displaced persons from Pakistan during 1947-48, and from other states of India throughout the period. The efforts of the public agencies - the Central Government and the Delhi Development Authority - to expand housing have been matched by those of individuals and cooperative societies. But the efforts have been focussed on providing housing to people of medium and high income groups; the housing needs of the poor have been met by rapid growth of slums and unauthorised colonies. Expansion of physical and social infrastructure has also proved inadequate to meet the demands on it. The reliance in the absence of a mass transit facility, on a miscellany of motor vehicles for movement within the city, has resulted in very high levels of air and noise pollution. The hopeful beginning with long-term planning, made with successful implementation of the first master plan 1961-81, has suffered a set back as a result of the failure of the Central Government to approve the second master plan 1981-2001. The Regional Plan 2001 for the National Capital Region, approved in 1988 by all the governments concerned, is also not being implemented. In the resulting, impasse there is unplanned growth of a giant conurbation adding to its various problems. The paper recommends revival of metropolitan and regional planning for direction of growth of the conurbation to 2010. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

While the cooperatives received a great deal of scholarly attention during the 1970s and 1980s, relatively little has been published on recent developments at Mondragon. It is time to update the Mondragon story. In 1991, 100 cooperatives joined to become the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation. This super-structure has permitted an important degree of centralised control over member cooperatives. Yet, it has also been the source of substantial challenges, both structural and ideological, to this alternative form of industrial organisation. We appear to be witnessing the cooperatives' decline, the end of a great experiment in favour of just another capitalist enterprise. This story is important both for cooperativism in Mondragon itself and for scholars and practitioners worldwide who find in Mondragon proof than an alternative, less exploitative approach to industrial organisation is possible.},

Multi-purpose cooperatives like the Israeli moshav are characterized by financial advantages that decrease the risk of the individual farmer as a borrower. This multi-cooperative solution may particularly suit situations of crucial capital access coupled with limited individual land property rights. The basic modeling insight presented in this paper is on the use of group credit to improve the risk profile under the above circumstances.

Although they are the most important contract farmers in terms of quantity and quality of produce, they are most dependent on the management for their supply of inputs, as well as for transport, processing and marketing facilities. Little wonder that they were the farmers who formed a co-operative in the early 1980s, when deteriorating market conditions for palm oil threatened the company's continuing existence and the farmers' chances for capital accumulation. Unable to force the management to keep to the terms of the contract, the executive board of the co-operative tried to achieve a larger measure of autonomy vis-a-vis the company by creating nurseries and transport and processing facilities of its own.},

Using a sample of 1,247 workers from producer cooperative, employee stock ownership, conventional union, and conventional non-union wood products mills, we show that this more complex spillover model gives us a better understanding of the linkages between workplace and political experiences.},

This paper analyzes how differences in incentive structure constrain the attractiveness of interest-rate speculation and other risk-taking opportunities to managers and regulators of credit unions. Despite these better incentives, robust present-value calculations establish that NCUSIF fell into economic insolvency during the mid-1980s. Besides calculating the extent of this insolvency, the paper also seeks to explain why, after NCUSIF became insolvent, it could rebuild its reserves without an explicit or implicit taxpayer bailout. Our explanation turns on cross-industry coinsurance responsibilities and the shallowness of the fund's observed insolvency relative to industry net worth. We identify forces in the decisionmaking environment tending to limit the depth and duration of unresolved insolvencies at individual credit unions. Managerial opportunities to benefit personally from taking risks that would flow through to NCUSIF are constrained by difficulties in converting a credit union to stockholder form and by the intensity of proactive monitoring of troubled credit unions by sister institutions and other private coinsurers. We conjecture that expanded use of coinsurance and private monitoring could reduce taxpayer loss exposure elsewhere in government deposit insurance systems.},

Such institutions are unable to raise external capital to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, and are thus forced to rely upon retained surpluses to generate capital. This, it is argued, creates an incompatibility between the regulatory structure and institutional for M, imposes an arbitrary constraint on coöperatives’ growth and can induce a focus upon inappropriate financial targets by credit union management. A further impediment to the survival of coöperative financial institutions can be found in the risk weights applied for capital adequacy purposes.

We provide evidence from a specially-commissioned survey on the characteristics and functioning of UCCs. Our statistical and econometric analysis points to the tentative conclusion that there are major regional differences in the performance of UCCs both in terms of the quality of loans granted and overall profitability. The latter is also influenced by the quality of the loans made, and this in turn is affected by the number of directors in the UCC and the extent to which the UCC grants loans to state-owned enterprises.},

While better-off groups save and borrow more, a greater proportion of low-income users would not have purchased goods and services in the absence of a credit union.

Lele's analysis of cooperative "failure' is discussed in relation to its public choice theory framework - one which is flawed when trying to understand local forms of public action. The SANASA Thrift and Credit Cooperative Societies in Sri Lanka provide empirical evidence to support the counter-argument. Since the late 1970s, SANASA's geographical spread and membership has increased dramatically. The cooperative network is one of the largest sources of rural financial services in the country. Based on fieldwork and a survey of members, data is presented to show how the Thrift and Credit Cooperatives have brought real benefits to poorer members. Significant numbers of borrowers have achieved increased incomes linked to their use of credit, and there is evidence of some graduation above the poverty line. SANASA cooperatives are notable because they have not, generally, been "captured' by local elites wishing to use them for their own interests. SANASA illustrates how purely self-interested behaviour is not axiomatic, and that there are conditions in which local forms of collective action emerge and can be sustained. The study shows the weakness in public choice theory becuse of its failure to incorporate the role of leaders as a factor in its analytical framework. In conclusion, the argument suggests that cooperatives merit renewed consideration as an organisational form which can, in some contexts, play a poverty-alleviation role. -from Authors},

    abstract = {The premise of this paper is that the strong trends toward ever increasing centralization in the agricultural producing sector of the United States in the 1980s will exacerbate in the middle-to-late 1990s. This, in turn, will lead to both radical changes in the consumer movement by the year 2000, and also to a completely redefined mission for the corporate marketing function as well. Specifically, the deliberate federal policies of the 1980s which led to a "shake-out" of the small family farm units in favor of large agri-business concerns in order to reduce federal subsidies will lead, in the 1990s, to the most noted of deleterious consequences of monopolization, namely ever increasing prices and lowered quality. The authors believe that by the late 1990s the American public will perceive this state of affairs as being intolerable and it will lead them to organize "Big Consumerism", a cohesive, much strengthened version of the consumer movement of the 1980s. This movement will, among other major activities, establish consumer cooperatives as a way to control costs through the elimination of unnecessary middlemen. In addition, this new consumerism will demand a change in the ethical standards of business behavior which, in turn, will result in a reformation in the role of the "New Marketer". This "New Marketer" function will be envisioned and practiced by incumbents as informational and educational, adhering to the highest standards of truthfulness concerning the products they are attempting to market. In this regard, the role of governmental agencies will be greatly strengthened and expanded to insure that the marketing profession lives up to these highest ethical standards and practices. © 1993 Iona College.},

    abstract = {Horace Plunkett′s Irish cooperative association introduced credit cooperatives into Ireland in 1894. The Irish cooperatives were modeled on the very successful Raiffeisen credit cooperatives of rural Germany. Credit cooperatives were never successful in Ireland, in contrast to other branches of Irish cooperation. Irish bankers argued that credit cooperatives failed simply because there was no need for such an institution. Several observers, including parliamentary bodies, came to the opposite conclusion: credit was expensive for smallholders, and credit cooperatives were a potential solution to the problem. This essay argues that several features of the Irish economic and social environment undermined the cooperative′s operation. The Irish credit cooperatives never attracted as members the more prosperous locals who provided crucial monitoring and expertise in Germany. The Irish cooperative movement was also never able to develop the strong central auditing federations that supervised and certified German cooperatives. Finally, rural Irish people seemed reluctant to force their neighbors to repay loans or face adverse consequences, which undermined the monitoring and enforcement advantages that cooperatives potentially have over commercial banks. This episode illustrates both the importance of timing in institutional development and the difficulty of transplanting institutions from one social and economic context to another. © 1994 Academic Press.

    abstract = {This article is based on over seven months of participant observation in an agricultural cooperative in Nicaragua in 1989, a literature review and interviews in other coops. The article presents an overview of the broader grassroots movement of Nicaraguan cooperative formation (over 3300 agricultural coops were formed in the 1980s). This movement was affected by the coop participants, as they struggled for control, and in turn affected the national social and economic situation. The coops and the broader national coop movement are shown to be empowering of the participants. However, while some factors enhanced the possibility of empowerment, other complex interrelated factors impeded its development. Autocratic leadership was prevalent, intermingled with apprehension about leadership and fears of failure. Outside service providers, although seemingly helpful, also impeded empowerment through subtle condescension and distance. The most effective mutual exchange occurred when outsiders integrated as insiders. Lessons are drawn for service to the grassroots coop movement through "accompaniment" or processes of participant action research.},

Much of the knowledge gained from that evolution should be applicable to the developing world. Yet, one must be careful not to try to apply the Finnish model directly to developing countries that have different cultural backgrounds, government constitutions, and economic and social obligations. The Finnish experience shows that development is based on consumers' initiative. Each party should assume the duties that exist. Consumers should pay or otherwise cover the main part of the costs. The government should concentrate on policy issues, promotion, and guidance, Associations should have management responsibility, where the role of the key person, the “champion”/“prime-mover” is decisive, The private sector could supply many of the external services. External support agencies and developing countries should analyse the experiences and potential of water associations in their areas. More realistic time-frames should be allowed for development cooperation projects in the sector Consumer-managed water supply systems exist in many other developed, and even developing countries, although largely unrecognised by the authorities. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In the first part of the paper, the government can choose to support the formation of a marketing cooperative by a group of farmers, or to establish a public marketing firm. The resulting market structures will thus be a duopoly of one marketing cooperative and one private wholesaler, or a mixed duopoly including a public firm. The equilibrium outcomes of the two market arrangements are analysed and the welfare implications compared. It is shown that both consumers' surplus and total welfare are higher in a mixed duopoly with public firm than in a mixed duopoly with cooperative, which is in turn socially superior to a pure private duopoly. In the second part, agents' incentives with regard to choice of ownership structure are discussed and analysed in a two‐stage game. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

The amount of loans granted was found to be elastic to changes in GNP per capita, salary remittances from migrant workers, government budget deficit or surplus, commercial bank lending, share deposits by cooperators, value of assets held by credit unions, and unpaid loan balance.},

    abstract = {Sharing expenses by the residents of localities where public flood control works are to be undertaken is indispensable for the materialization of flood control works of medium and small-sized rivers in modern times. Flood prevention cooperatives organized by inhabitants in frequently-inundated areas have played an important role in bearing the expenses allotted to localities. But some of the cooperatives could not bear their share of the expenses and flood control work failed consequently. The author analyzed the causes of failure of a flood prevention cooperative in sharing expenses and clarified the problems of local share in expenses taking the case of the Kokufu River Flood Prevention Cooperative on Sado Island. The results are as follows: The most decisive reason that the Kokufu River Flood Prevention Cooperative could not bear its allotment is the impossibility of payment by the inhabitants of the upper basin, because extremely high rates of allotment in the upper basin were decided without adjusting the conflict between upper basin residents and lower basin residents. Hence prefectural river improvement work of the Kokufu River was halfed. Futhermore the following situation contributed to default in payment. In the Kokufu River basin advanced mining techniques were applied to flood control works in the Edo Period, and these works were carried out several times in connection with the prosperity and decline of the Sado Gold Mine. Some rational features in the works, imposition and repayment system, and so on can be seen. But after the Meiji Restoration small land-ownership in the island society prescribed repayment of much of the expenses of river improvement, and work was stopped. Therefore consideration must be given to relative flood damage between the upper basin and lower basin so as not to produce outstanding inequality between the two districts when making allotment rates. Generally, in frequently-inundated areas, we can see conflict between the uper basin and lower basin. But in that case flood control work cannot be realized without adjustment of advantages and disadvantages between the two districts. Also realization of flood control work requires the intervention of the prefectural goverment with large funds. © 1992, The Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan, Inc. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {In this study, the regional conditions for the formation of areas in the broiler chicken industry have been elucidated through an examination of the area formation processes. Furthermore, the general conditions in production area formation have been investigated. As for study areas, four areas were selected: the Tajima area in Hyogo and Fuji area in Shizuoka were chosen as the production areas located in the environs of metropolitan regions. While the Koyu area in Miyazaki and the northern area of Iwate were selected as case studies in the periphery. General conditions found in the study for the formation of production area in the broiler chicken industry are as follows. The first is the participation of business firms and agricultural cooperatives’ groups as an integrator in the industry, setting up processing factories through which they developed competition to secure broiler chicken raising farms. Consequently, expanding the production area spatially, the farms gradually enlarged their sizes to carry out specialized management. The second is the predominance of marginal farms on the less favored areas where the integrators moved. These marginal farms which did not have much alternative were willing to raise broiler chickens, expecting larger incomes and stable farm management. The third is the special attributes of the broiler chicken industry such as a relatively small initial investment, and the simplicity of chicken raising which enables easy participation for even an unexperienced farm household, and an assurance of relatively high income. © 1991, The Association of Japanese Geographers.

    abstract = {During the period of April to June 1995, 291 dairy farmers of 27 cooperatives in Minas Gerais were interviewed to obtain informations related to crossbreeding practices. The majority of the farmers (92.4%) had crossbred European x Zebu herds with the European fraction being between 1/32 and 3/4, and predominately Holstein-Friesian (94.7%) and Gyr (81.1%). Most of the farmers (45.8%) planned to keep the herd intermediate and 40.0% had no defined goal for breed type (European, Zebu or crossbred). Among those that intended to keep the herd intermediate, 47.3% planned to use just a single European or Zebu sire for the next five years, 42.6% planned to use crossbred sires, and 10.1% planned to use criss-cross breeding. This result is in agreement with the low frequency of farmers that use hand mating or artificial insemination (20.6%). It is concluded that due to the confusion of the farmers, the difficulties of implementing rotational crossing, and the lack of crossbred sires selected by modern methods, the continuous F, replacement system may be a practical solution to maintain the herd intermediate between European and Zebu in herds with limitations in nutrition, management, and health.},

    abstract = {The centralised management of natural resources by the government departments has alienated people at the gras roots and resulted into collapse of traditional institutions created and managed by the local people. Prior to colonial rule, amongst various institutional models being tried in India and elsewhere for sustainable management of natural resources, the tree growers' cooperatives promoted by the National tree Growers' Cooperative Federation Limited are one which are founded on democratic norms and are progressing towards self reliance and sustainability. The Tree Growers' Cooperatives Project is currently under implementation in six states of the country with the assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA). the Federation is trying to re-establish peoples' institutions in the form of cooperatives for natural resource management in a decentralised manner. The Tree growers' Cooperatives organised under the project acquire 30-40 ha of highly degraded compact patches of revenue wastelands on long lease in closer proximity of small/medium size villages in eco-fragile regions and trans-form it into a biodiversity rich resource over a period of 8-10 yr. The results so far have proved the capacity of the rural people in establishing and managing the Tree Growers' Cooperatives, developing norms for regeneration, protection and sustainable utilisation of biomass from the village commons. the members of the cooperatives have also demonstrated their cost effective managerial capacity, innovative ideas in dispute resolution, benefit sharing and techniques of soil and water conservation and plant protection. The myth that resource management, institutional development and forestry are the jobs to be performed by the people trained in management schools has been broken by the success of the tree growers' cooperatives in more than 350 villages in 14 districts of India. With past eight years of experience, emphasis is now being laid on holistic resource management, participatory planning, monitoring and evaluation and awareness for matching resources with human and livestock population. The paper deals with the process of establishment of tree growers cooperatives, socioeconomic, political and administrative factors influencing their growth and gains in terms of human and natural resource regeneration and its collective management in a sustainable manner. The paper also covers intangible benefits of the Tree Growers' Cooperatives and future scope of their interaction into the new areas of natural resource management.},

The complex links together industrial, service, and agricultural cooperatives with a bank and a series of educational cooperatives. The continued expansion of the complex defies the conventional wisdom that worker cooperatives can only survive briefly in special niches not of interest to multi-national businesses. Mondragón’s dynamic growth and development cannot be due to some special features of the Basque culture. Success is due in part to the extraordinary vision and leadership of the founder, father José María Arizmendiarrieta, to the social inventions he created, and to the organizational culture that he and his followers built to guide the complex. © 1995, Springer.

    abstract = {In recent years Japanese vegetable growers tend to employ women who work to make up crops to finished products by arranging and packing. On the other hand it is seen in the same district that the oldmen and women specialize in growing the vegetables without the help of younger men. This cannot be adequately expanded from the available statistical data. The author attended to analyse horticulture districts which have various vegetable growers, and so selected Kitano-cho, Fukuoka Prefecture as a research field. The findings about the vegetable growing groups are as follows: There are 3 types of vegetable growing farms formed from mainly farming-labor family members: (1) The vegetable growers who manage the plastic green houses under fixed structures. They employ usually women, and sell the vegetables to chiefly the agricultural cooperative. (2) The full-time farm households (except above (1) type farms) consisting of young or middle-aged men, lacking fixed green houses. (3) The powerless labor group which consists of oldmen and women. This group's farmhouses sell the vegetables to merchants instead of the agricultural cooperative. In spite of being a small district, Kitano-cho has a large vegetable output which we can measure in the statistical data. Kitano-cho stands in the fertile alluvial plain on the Chikugo River. The common explanation for the large vegetable output comes on the good soil conditions of Kitano-cho. The author points out that Kitano-cho owes the recent development of vegetable production to many employed women. They work to make up the reaped vegetables to finished products by sorting out, putting in order, packing into boxes. Most of them are 40∼60 year-old housewives whose husbands work the offices or factories. As a result, we can interpret of the employed women promoting to increase the agricultural earnings in whole Kitano-cho town. But, the author emphasizes: there may be a hidden distinction between the two sexes in the lower wages for the employed women. Though the Japanese law prohibits to make the sexual distinction any working condition, not all the women can easily find work on favorable terms. © 1995, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

    abstract = {This paper discusses research by the author on women and cooperatives in India. The findings are supplemented by information from preliminary research by the author on a number of other cooperatives in which women were involved and from secondary sources. The research indicates that producer cooperatives for women can be successful if there are even a few women with the necessary skills and time required. Many cooperatives studied failed in part because of lack of enthusiasm of the women involved, indicating the problems the promotion of producer cooperatives involves. The paper argues that a far more wide‐ranging debate is needed about the ways in which the ideals of cooperation and empowerment can be preserved, while at the same time responding to the context in which cooperatives have to operate. There is no ‘ideal cooperative’ but a range of possible options. The varying needs of women require a participatory transformation of both state and NGO cooperative development agencies. Much greater commitment is needed to assist women in relevant ways. Copyright © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

Whilst most analyses have effectively treated credit unions as unsocial, uncontested spaces of purely economic considerations, this paper enters into the interrelational, and social space of the credit union study group. In so doing, it illustrates two interesting paradoxes at the heart of credit union study group. In so doing, it illustrates two interesting paradoxes at the heart of credit union operations. Firstly, it suggests a number of potentially exclusionary effects recent deregulatory legislation has on the demarcation of common bond boundaries. Secondly, it illustrates how common bond boundary construction initiates a purification of financial space, but argues that the act of boundary formation itself is ultimately exclusionary in nature. Awareness of such issues on the part of the credit union development community of Kingston Upon Hull is highlighted through recent changes in the city's overall credit union development strategy.},

Cooperatives would seem vulnerable to liquidity problems caused by correlated shocks to their member's fortunes. They would also seem vulnerable to fraud and mis-management and to have problems convincing the public they were safe places to invest money. The historical record shows, however, that the cooperatives overcame these problems, growing steadily in numbers and assets. The minimal government regulation to which the cooperatives were subject did little to overcome their potential weaknesses. Rather, the cooperatives devised a series of regional banks and auditing associations to which most cooperatives eventually belonged. Regional cooperative banks provided liquidity and emergency loans to member cooperatives, obviating some disadvantages of their small size. Auditing associations monitored member cooperatives and provided confidence to the public by ensuring adherence to basic standards. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

    abstract = {The U.S. Cooperative Extension system (USCES) faces some serious challenges. Its relevancy and necessity are under continuous scrutiny as the number of farmers and the political power of the agricultural vote diminishes. These challenges provide an excellent opportunity to explore alternative sources of funding for the USCES and methods of technology transfer to farmers. Our objectives were to review the process and results of commercialization (the transition to user-paid consultancy) and privatization (the transition from government to privately owned) of New Zealand's agricultural extension service. Full commercialization of the New Zealand extension service took nearly 9 yr (1986 to 1994) and 3 yr (1992 to 1995) of negotiating before it was sold to a private company. During the commercialization process, the market for paid advisors increased and many of them left the public extension service to become private agricultural consultants. Many farmers were initially unwilling to pay for consultancy services. On the other hand, implementation of advice and adoption of new technologies has been greater among farmers when advice and technology are purchased than when they are provided 'free.' Since the commercialization of publicly funded extension, farmer cooperatives and commodity boards have ben to provide 'free' or low cost services to transfer information to farmers. Educational models and goals, and client-advisor relationships have also changed as a result of user-pays. The commercialization and privatization of publicly funded agricultural extension is a relatively new process and its affect on the long-term sustainability of agriculture within a country are uncertain. Consequently, additional in-depth investigation into the process and its long-term consequences on agricultural productivity, profitability, and social well-being should be completed before initiating such a plan in the USA.},

    abstract = {The current high yields of crops, which are partly due to the use of pesticides, have provided high quality produce at a relatively low price. However, environmental and consumer pressure groups are demanding strategies for a reduction in pesticide use, while maintaining the quality and availability to which we have become accustomed. These demands have been met in part by the establishment of farmers’ co-operatives supplying produce grown to recognized organic standards, but at a higher cost and limited availability due to the smaller scale of production and higher degree of wastage from pest damage. Attention is drawn to a middle way between highly efficient practices using pesticides and less efficient, smaller scale organic farming systems. One such intermediate scheme is Integrated Pest Management (IPM); its origin, development and application are outlined and key components of any IPM scheme summarized. Major food retailers have a part to play in encouraging growers to consider such schemes, and educating customers in the value of alternatives to both conventional agricultural practices utilizing pesticides, and organic growing methods. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In this context, the use of passive voice, subjunctive forms, hedges, the choice of pronouns and address forms is of specific interest to us. In the second co-operative, an Agricultural Extension Officer present in the meeting interferes, practically taking over the task of chairing the meeting. While the chairwoman is forced to defend her position, her irritation and uncertainty are expressed in contributions that contain several characteristics of a powerless speech style. At the same time, the chairwoman's reply to the intrusion shows commitment and emphasis on a point that is crucial to her. In Meeting Two presequences, false starts, changes in the word order, hedges, direct speech, choice of tense and address forms are particularly relevant.},

    abstract = {Cooperative organizational forms such as franchising and joint venturing have long been popularamong hospitality chains. However, not all chains use cooperative organizational forms and those that do varygreatlyin theirproclivityto use them. One possible explanation for this variation is that when a chain confronts critical resource scarcities, its managers will use cooperative organization in order to build upon the resources of their partners. However a second approach, agency theory, suggests that chain managers use cooperative organization to minimize the costs of monitor ing outlet managers. Using data on 94 restaurant chains, hypotheses are tested that investigate the independent and joint efficacy of these explanations. Results show that capital and brand name are important resources affecting the choice of organizational form whereas geographic dispersion, task programmability, and asset specificity are key agency variables. Overall, perhaps the key finding is that the ability of agency theory to explain organizational form is diminished among resource scarce chains. The results, therefore, suggest that both perspectives are needed to fully explain the choice of organizational form. © 1997 THE COUNCIL ON HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND INSTITUTIONAL EDUCATION.},

Its main activities include procurement, sale and processing of arecanut and cocoa, advancement of loan and essential inputs to the members, regulation of arecanut trade and promotion of research in production, processing and marketing of arecanut.

The credit union is such a device. It has an established and proven record of success in many countries but, outside of Northern Ireland, credit unions are in their infancy in the United Kingdom.

    abstract = {This paper examines the functioning and performance of a large cooperative federation in Nicaragua, concerned mainly with retailing. Set up in late 1985, in response to undersupply to smallholders, especially those in the mountainous interior, it has followed a strategy of rapid expansion. By using a federal structure which has allowed middle and junior management freedom to take the initiative, and by adopting mostly simple, appropriate, and non‐bureaucratic procedures, the federation has succeeded in mounting an impressively large operation, with over 190 shops selling a wide variety of goods. On the other hand, at the centre, sales have grown sluggishly since 1988, costs have risen, and liquidity has become a problem. Moreover, the organization has lost capital, largely through its pricing policy. These can be blamed partly on the federated structure, the lack of a medium‐term strategy, and dependency upon external donors; and partly on the trading environment of recession and uncertainty. The case study illustrates the difficulties in establishing large‐scale cooperative enterprise, and the need in the long run to realise comparative advantage.

    abstract = {Natural resource tenure and economic feasibility of resource‐based activities are two of the most important issues in the current debate around environmental degradation and rural poverty. While many analyses have blamed the ‘tragedy of the commons’ and government mismanagement for environmental destruction, this paper provides a case study of resin tapping in Honduras which formulates the hypotheses that common property regimes can be successful and that economic liberalization policies may be detrimental to community‐level resource schemes. Over half of the 6000 farmer‐resin tappers in Honduras are organized into forty‐six co‐operatives that market the tree sap, wood and other forest products. These activities combine the twin goals of community‐based forest preservation and income generation. Established legally in 1974, the tapping groups have expanded to include a variety of organizational and technical arrangements. The two co‐operatives of Villa Santa and San Juan de Ojojona demonstrate contrasting histories, ecological endowments and economic outcomes. Currently the Honduran resin tappers are facing problems over their access to forest resources, the fluctuating profitability of extractive activities and the stability of the co‐operative organization. These three issues are relevant to a variety of community‐based environmental activities, and the lessons of the Honduran experience can be applied to analyse the processes of environmental degradation and community response elsewhere in the Third World. © 1991 Institute of Social Studies},

Results indicate that the propensity to plan is related to key organizational processes, structural configurations, administrative procedures, managerial perceptions of environmental predictability, and multiple performance measures. It was found that formal planning has different roles among various types of organizations and that managers should bear this in mind as they engage in planning processes within non-profit institutions. The results also suggest that formal planning facilitates communication between management and the board, directs the organization to focus on critical success factors, and results in superior performance along important criteria. © 1990.},

    abstract = {The aim is to examine some of today's problems of agricultural cooperatives in Italy. The growing agribusiness competition is stimulating debate about the compatibility between the historical principles of cooperative principles and the economic efficiency requested for their survival. The need to achieve high quality economic performance brings about cooperative organizational patterns characterized by staff control over members, who progressively lose their autonomy of decision. The acceptance of this model is determined by two reasons: the interest in members for cooperative organizations capable of assuring them consistent returns with the development of agri-business activities; and the need to eliminate the inefficiencies created by the competition between Catholic and Communist cooperatives. The present economic crisis of many right and left cooperatives is the result of the ideological division that has influenced the cooperatives in the past and gradually drove them to be heavily dependent on political parties. -from Author},

Firm responses include agenda control, restrictions to obtain a homogeneous voting population, and limits on firm size. We consider three long‐surviving producer cooperatives, representing extreme cases of collective decision making, and find that their organization is sensitive to the costs of voting and to the employment of mechanisms to constrain those costs.

    abstract = {The failure of forestry to contribute to poverty reduction in Central America is due to public policies which inhibit its profitability. Absence of public regulation of harvesting and competing subsidies to agriculture keep forestry stumpage prices artificially low. This encourages destruction of the forest resource, which damages both the environment and the potential to reduce poverty. A comparison of Costa Rica and Honduras reveals two dissimilar approaches toward forest policy. While Costa Rica attempts to raise producer and grower stumpage prices by tax credits, soft loans and differential species fees, Honduras enforces price ceilings and uses centralized authority to control forest production and export. Both countries exhibit weaknesses in the management control cycle of programming, budgeting, implementing and evaluating their forest policies. Yet the Costa Rican approach has increased stumpage prices already, which bodes well for their forest sector. By contrast, the major beneficiary of Honduran forest policy has been COHDEFOR, the state enterprise responsible for forestry management, controlling production, and running its national system of agroforestry cooperatives. Despite greater public authority and resources than the Costa Rican forest service (DGF), the Honduran forest policy is not likely to increase producer profitability or reduce poverty in the near future.

A logistic pattern of cooperative growth is tested and found to dominate a view that the number of coops grows because of support organizations. Drawing upon an ecological model it is suggested that the factor which limits growth is the availability of management and, further, that the growth of the competing 'small-scale sector' is at the expense of the cooperative sector. Management nurtured in the cooperative sector moves into the small-scale sector. Case-study analysis using a Boolean analysis suggests that legitimate and capable management are essential to success of cooperatives particularly with technologies which generate production interdependencies. Finally, supporting evidence for the significance of management competence and interdependence in explaining performance is outlined using an augmented CobbDouglas production function framework. © 1990, Sage Publications.

More recently Japan’s rice policy has acquired an international dimension. In 1986, rice joined the list of agricultural commodities targeted by the United States for market access; it is now one of the key items subject to agricultural trade negotiations in the GATT Uruguay Round. One of the most serious and urgent policy questions facing the Japanese administration is whether to maintain the ban on rice imports or introduce some form of partial or total liberalization of the rice market. This paper examines the forces arrayed on each side of the rice liberalization debate in Japan and ventures a prediction about the final outcome. How the government resolves this question will have wider significance for both Japan’s domestic politics and its international trade relations. © 1990 Oxford university press.},

Three well equipped laboratories were established and surveys were carried out. In 1981, services were made available to farmers, co-operatives, farmers organizations, etc. Highly qualified field personnel is advising farmers, interpreting analytical results and working out fertilizer recommendations. Services are partially paid by the beneficiaries. During 1985–1988. service was rendered to about 22, 000 farmers. In the meantime, a program was set up to establish service laboratories throughout the country. Eleven were initiated, but still not established to serve the farmers directly. However, they help in indicating fertilizer needs of the country in general. Some universities are running analysis as services for farmers within very limited scope. Gained experience by the project is now under evaluation.

The practice of denying credit to all group members in case of default is the most effective and least costly way of enforcing joint liability. Another way to encourage members to repay is to require mandatory deposits that are reimbursed only when all borrowers repay their loans.The article points out that credit cooperatives that mobilize savings deposits are less dependent on external sources and increase the borrowers' incentive to repay. The success of credit cooperatives requires training of members as well as management. Experience suggests that credit cooperatives should not expand their activities beyond financial intermediation until they develop strong institutional and managerial capabilities. © 1990 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.},

The key novel idea is to conceptualize cooperative governance in the light of the proposed distinction between the core and peripheral activities of cooperatives. While core activities are based on members' truly common interests, peripheral activities include all else. This approach allows tracing governance challenges of agricultural co-operatives back to the inflation of peripheral activities. Based on this approach, cooperative managers and members are advised to minimize these activities and to draw clear boundaries between core and periphery.},

Also, they do not have any specific risk business control, or risk management is not yet worked out with emphasis by agricultural cooperatives. Already, analyzing cost management, there is a more active stance. It was found that cooperatives employ cost controls, methods of costing and management controls that help into the decision making process.

They decide on big investment plans for the coming year as well as on many less important items like purchase price of pork and corn or service workshops and transport. The decision-making process nevertheless remains the same: they use statistical voting system to accept (or refuse) individual items. In standard situation of limited financial resources they have to create preference lists of individual items. This paper deals with mathematical properties of such preference lists and their comparison to statistical voting. If a board is to decide between two alternatives a and b, usually the majority rule procedure is applied and the alternative with the most votes is declared a winner. From mathematical point of view the majority rule properties were formulated by May (1952), who showed that if the number of board members is odd and each election procedure produces a unique winning item then the majority rule is the only so called social choice procedure for two alternatives that satisfies the following three conditions: it treats all the board members the same, it treats both alternatives the same and it is monotone. Nevertheless, if there are more than two possible choices, the situation is completely different. The inner structure of the problem is very rich and needs more detailed research. The situation is demonstrated on voting for investment items of the agricultural marketing cooperative Mrakov in South Bohemia.},

    abstract = {Cooperative advertising is a practice that a manufacturer pays retailers a portion of the local advertising cost in order to induce sales. Cooperative advertising plays a significant role in marketing programs of channel members. Nevertheless, most studies to date on cooperative advertising have assumed that the market demand is only influenced by advertising expenditures but not by retail price. This paper addresses channel coordination by seeking optimal cooperative advertising strategies and equilibrium pricing in a two-member distribution channel. We establish and compare two models: a non-cooperative, leader-follower game and a cooperative game. We develop propositions and insights from the comparison of these models. The cooperative model achieves better coordination by generating higher channel-wide profits than the non-cooperative model with these features: (a) the retailer price is lower to consumers; and (b) the advertising efforts are higher for all channel members. We identify the feasible solutions to a bargaining problem where the channel members can determine how to divide the extra profits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a robust crop production model applied to an agricultural cooperative. The objective of the model is to maximize the total revenue of the cooperative. The social aspect is addressed through a similarity in farmer revenues. Moreover, crop yield uncertainty, which results from the difference in skills of the farmers, is integrated in the robust model. The crop production plan must satisfy the market demand for each crop. Consequently, crop production that exceeds the demand is penalized. The models are solved by an optimization software, and the results indicate that when the model robustness increases, the value of the objective function decreases. However, the decision maker can make a decision tradeoff between the probability of constraint satisfaction and the value of the objective function. Finally, the managerial recommendations are discussed.},

We develop a model for the farmers' marketing decision that relates farm size to the share of produce delivered to the cooperative. Based on survey data from cooperatively organised coffee farmers in Costa Rica, we find that the share delivered to cooperatives decreases with farm size, albeit at a decreasing rate. The empirical results thus confirm the theoretical model prediction of a u-shaped relationship between farm size and member deliveries.},

However, there have been no efforts to investigate the role of collective entrepreneurship in the creation and management of new businesses in Morocco. Furthermore, we build on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate and explain entrepreneurial intention among the rural youth members of agricultural cooperatives, and identify the vulnerabilities and factors that influence the choice or decision-making between permanent membership at the cooperative and an entrepreneurial career. In this case, we apply the cognitive approach to survey rural youth in the Draa-Tafilalet region of Morocco in 2020. The binary logistic regression analysis technique has been used and applied to build the best model to explain why some rural youth members of the cooperative, but not others, choose to become entrepreneurs. We model how agricultural cooperatives may favor or inhibit the translation of entrepreneurial intention into new venture creation. A random sample size of 130 young people has been selected, from which 54 are intending to start a business and 76 have a negative intention of self-employment. The results of the analysis showed that socio-demographic variables, individual perceptions, previous experience, and the activities of the cooperative were statistically significant and reliable in building the binary logistic regression model. Findings also suggest that the risks of agribusiness and financing constraints have a negative influence on entrepreneurial intentions of the youth and women in agricultural cooperatives.},

The control function approach addresses the selection bias of off-farm employment. The results show that smartphone use significantly increases women's decision-making power, partially channeled through increasing women's off-farm employment. The mechanism effect is robust to using both binary and intensive measurements of off-farm employment. Therefore, a policy to improve access to internet facilities and smartphone use could improve women's decision-making power through employment in the off-farm sector.},

In this study, the relationship between the financial and social efficiency of South African agricultural cooperatives was examined. Data, comprising 1788 agricultural cooperatives, were obtained from the Cooperative Data Analysis System database. Only 387 observations without missing values were predicted in the empirical model. Data envelopment analysis scores for the financial and social efficiency indicators were computed. A two-stage residual inclusion method estimated the social efficiency model. The results show that social efficiency is positively influenced by financial efficiency and other factors. These include the number of employees, the enterprise type, and compliance with internal control practices. The social efficiency of agricultural cooperatives decreases for institutions that have recently been trained and that comply with the annual financial audits and profit tax. Social efficiency also decreases with age, but it increases with the square of the agricultural cooperative's age. This suggests that financially-efficient agricultural cooperatives may achieve social efficiency, that young agricultural cooperatives are not the ideal candidates for addressing the social efficiency challenges of agricultural cooperatives, and that the current training received by agricultural cooperatives does not empower them with social efficiency.},

Several studies have tried to assess the importance of diversification on the financial outcomes in agricultural co-operatives with limited success. Design/methodology/approach The three main concepts were combined in a working model. A survey was developed to gather data on financial, diversification and expansion strategies from 67 co-operatives (44 per cent return rate). Data were processed using a partial least squares structural equation model. Findings The findings suggest that expansion is directly responsible for both the financial output and diversification strategy; however, no hard evidence supports the view that the diversification of production in some agro-industrial co-operatives leads to positive financial results. Research limitations/implications Only larger Brazilian co-operatives (>$50m in annual revenues) were considered. Co-operatives facing other scenarios or smaller co-operatives could have different outcomes. Practical implications Besides diversifying their co-operatives for financial reasons, managers should also consider risk aversion and adapting to new farmers' portfolios as probable reasons. Originality/value Extant literature asserts that diversification leads to financial growth; as the co-operatives studied show no such causal relationship, it follows that they diversify their portfolios for other purposes.},

The lack of an appropriate methodological basis for creating agricultural cooperative system prevents the process of organizing formation of new agricultural cooperatives, which leads to an objective need to develop the organizational and economic basis for the formation and operation of agricultural cooperatives. In this regard, the research and study of theoretical aspects, analysis of objective conditions for the formation and operation of agricultural cooperatives, development of methodological provisions and practical recommendations to substantiate their organizational and economic mechanism, including matters of management, profit, price, credit, formation and distribution are topical to the issue and most of the components listed above are of great practical importance. Aim and tasks. The aim of the research is to develop scientific, organizational and economic basis for the establishment and operation of agricultural cooperatives in a multistructural economy. The objectives of the research are: identifying the essence of the cooperative, adding several principles to the formation and classification of agricultural cooperatives, determining the conditions and factors necessary for their creation. Results. Theoretical and regulatory aspects of formation and development of agricultural cooperatives were specified taking into account the introduction of new principles for their operation: mandatory creation of indivisible funds for innovative activities, agricultural producers' interest and expediency for their participation in the associations; and classification of cooperatives in the production and service industries. Conclusions. Based on consideration of the integrated approach to the formation of cooperatives and farmers' organizations, necessary documentation and calculation of economic efficiency, the methodological provisions developed in the process of the research on the establishment and operation of agricultural cooperatives will allow agricultural producers to approach the formation of necessary cooperatives skillfully, easily determine the absolute and specific tax burden of agricultural cooperatives.},

    abstract = {Cooperative organizing around food and agriculture is nothing new (Knupfer, 2013). However, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in the cooperative legal form. This research has followed this rebirth in a region in the western United States where rural producers and urban consumers, gentrifying communities of color, and environmentally minded communities strive to improve other communities and food futures. As part of these efforts, it can be easy to assume cooperation within a legal status. Yet, as this research examines, cooperatives can be quite uncooperative in practice. Through extensive field work, we found that food and agriculture cooperatives struggle to make decision-making inclusive, may reproduce inequities through leadership performance, and may unevenly distribute the emotional work necessary to cooperation. These patterns also relate to how cooperatives access resources and point to tensions in expanding networks. While homogeneity can make interactions smoother-thereby making trust and day-to-day activities easier-it also limits a cooperative's (co-op) resource access. Resource access can be improved through partnerships, such as with nonprofits. However, these connections can lead to certain leadership performances that delegitimize cooperative efforts from the perspective of structurally disadvantaged community members. Further, the anonymity that consumers have become accustomed to creates challenges for recruiting shoppers because co-ops take more emotional work. A disproportionate amount of emotional work falls on staff members, contributing to resentment and insincere performance. We make a number of suggestions about how cooperatives can work to improve both organizational and interactional forms of cooperation.},

In Ethiopia, cooperatives are considered as important vehicles for linking smallholder farmers to markets and for rural development more generally. However, member commitment in cooperatives is not self-evident. Different scholars confirm that there is a decline in commitment of members to their cooperative. Consequently, it is important to identify what factors drive this decline to enhance member commitment and promote the performance of cooperatives. Thus, this paper seeks to explore the determinants of member commitment. Our empirical analysis is based on a 2014 survey among 240 members of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia. This paper makes two contributions to the academic body of knowledge on member commitment in agricultural cooperatives. First, it distinguishes between three elements of commitment: loyalty, identification and participation. By exploring the determinants of each element of commitment, we obtain a much richer picture of what drives members. Second, we make a distinction between multipurpose cooperatives and specialized marketing cooperatives. The study has important implications for policy makers, government and stakeholders of cooperatives for devising appropriate interventions that could enhance the commitment of members in agricultural cooperatives.},

In the qualitative section, by holding several meetings with experts and through the method of brainstorming, the opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses for the adapting of the agricultural cooperative organization to learning organization were identified. Then, using the SWOT model, strategies and action plan were identified for adapting the cooperative organization to the learning organization. Also, in the quantitative part of the research that was conducted among the members of the cooperatives, through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the role of the identified strategies was evaluated and the designed model was approved.

Although these cooperatives have been promoted as ideal bottom-to-top organizations to integrate women into economy as entrepreneurs, there has been significant decline in their numbers. This paper tackles with this contradictory situation and intends to offer an alternative research framework on the viability of the women's agricultural cooperatives in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach The paper is built on a critical assessment of the existing literature. It argues that a framework that brings together macro-, meso- and micro-factors will provide a springboard to unfold the gendered processes integral to rural female entrepreneurship in Turkey. Drawing on intersectional theory, the multilayered factors which operate to rural women's (dis)advantages through the cooperatives are unfolded as policymaking, policy implementation and everyday experiences. Findings For policymakers and implementers, it points out the need for a holistic and integrated understanding of rural female entrepreneurship and for re-formulation of policies at the state level. For rural women, it draws attention to the measures required to be taken at the cooperative level to overcome inequalities. Originality/value This paper is original in making explicit social, political and economic embeddedness of female entrepreneurship in rural Turkey.},

As a data collection instrument, the Scale of Perception of Organizational Support, short version (EPSO-R), developed by Queiroga, Brandao and Borges-Andrade (2015) was used. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used in order to list the most important criteria and sub-criteria under the perception of the investigated collaborators. Main findings: As main results, it is observed that employees prioritized Promotion and reward practices, especially with regard to symbolic and material rewards, the cooperative is also concerned with ensuring equipment and materials necessary for the effective performance of their tasks and granting bonuses to its employees as profit sharing (PLR). Employees also prioritized Material support for performance, this action demonstrates that the investigated cooperative provides individuals with an adequate and comfortable environment to carry out routine activities. Methodological / social / managerial contributions: It was found that the cooperative promotes the recognition of its employees and encourages the development of new ideas. Given the significance of these organizations, it is important to understand the elements prioritized by employees in relation to organizational support in cooperatives in the agricultural sector. Originality / relevance: It is noteworthy that this research opens the way to highlight the importance of the theme of organizational support for the area of people management and organizational behavior in the context of cooperatives.},

We find both similarities and differences between sample cooperatives and their counterparts in other countries. Estonian agricultural cooperatives tend to perform better than those without a board. However, more research at the member level is needed in order to draw definite conclusions. Member preference heterogeneity emerges as a potential future threat to organizational health and, thus, demands the attention of cooperative leaders in Estonia. We conclude that there exists considerable room for improvement through the introduction of a more flexible legal framework and the adoption of professional board governance processes, which includes director orientation training, inclusion of additional financial expertise and board evaluation routines.},

Understanding cultural embeddedness provides insight into why individuals and firms behave as they do and how their behavior can influence network structure. Contrary to the belief that firms act solely for profit and growth, we note that cultural contents such as values, social issues and political ideologies explain firms' motives and guide their economic activities. We explore the role of cultural embeddedness through a grounded study of Country Natural Beef, a sustainability-oriented agricultural cooperative in the western United States. This supply network demonstrates strongly competing cultural claims among its members as well as a unique institutionalized culture. Cultural interactions at the node and network levels explain the functioning of and changes to the network. Through interviews, analysis of archival information and direct observation of pivotal events over a period of 5 years, we unpack cultural embeddedness and take an incremental step toward a theory of cultural embeddedness in cooperative supply networks.

The current economic crisis has led to the development of cooperatives in Romania as well. Thus, we may say that at national level, according to the year they were established, there has been an increase in the number of cooperatives beginning with 2009, when 56 were registered. In 2010 the number increased to 81, and in 2011 the number of registered cooperatives decreased, reaching 54. At region level, the North-Western region stood out in 2010 with a number of 48 agricultural cooperatives. The year 2009 was representative for the Western region, with 7 cooperatives and for the North-Western region with 14 cooperatives, and the year 2011 was the most representative for the North-Western region with 16 established cooperatives.

They support collective activities where individual incentives are insufficient to produce public goods. The government of Nepal has been investing economic resources in this sector, prioritizing cooperatives as part of a strategy for poverty reduction. This study examines poor farmers' access to agricultural cooperatives and the impact of membership on farm and total household income, based on a household survey of 572 households and key informant interviews of 37 cooperative managers. The ethnicity of the family and the neighborhood, smallholder land size, distance to an agricultural cooperative, distance to the nearest local market, and distance to a motorable road are key determinants that influence cooperative membership. The analysis of the effects of cooperative membership is based on propensity score matching, controlling for a large array of household and community characteristics. The estimates imply that cooperative membership may significantly affect family net crop income, but the overall effects on total family income are modest. Agricultural cooperatives appear to be focused on financial services such as savings and credit activities but are less concerned with agricultural production, and cooperatives engage in almost no marketing activities.},

Moreover, drastic reductions in the cost of obtaining, processing and transmitting information are changing the way of doing business. In highly competitive times, increasing efficiency in the use of information and communication technology is essential to business sustainability. The methodology of the study is qualitative, because it analyzed the management reports from the last 20 years of the cooperatives operation (secondary data), which were crossed with the information obtained in the interviews (primary data) with the ICT managers of these organizations, and quantitative, because statistical analyzes and correlation tests were applied in the data. The results showed that the efficiency used in the entire production chain can yield better profitability and that the cooperatives with the highest percentage of ICT investments also have higher results in net assets. The tests show a correlation between ICT investments and the evolution of the results of most cooperatives studied.},

Thus, to critically explore the knowledge gap, the study evaluates the effects of cooperative participation towards adopting environmentally friendly production technologies based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The key variables used in the study have been extracted from an extensive literature investigation, while the empirical data has been collected from October to December 2020 from 292 kiwi-fruit farmers within the Shaanxi province of China. Simultaneously, the partial least square of structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) tools has been utilized to craft the final assessment. The factor loadings of all three latent variables have been statistically significant and interrelated for quantifying the proposed model. The statistically proven framework portrayed that cooperative organizations' participation positively impacts and shapes behavioral factors and facilitates the adoption of environmentally friendly production technologies. The study found the social structure like China, the impacts of cooperation could be crucial. As cooperative participation is an ample predictor for facilitating environmentally friendly technologies, the government should broaden the technical supports, and agricultural extension should also provide extended training for a smooth transition of the cooperatives.},

The research uses a quantitative approach based on a survey of agricultural cooperatives established in Brazil. The procedures focused on the descriptive analysis of empirical results, the use factor, and discriminant analysis. Factor analysis reported two dimensions of governance (reliability and transparency) and three of performance (financial control, profitability, and sustainability). The discriminant analysis allowed us to distinguish cooperatives with the best governance practices and those with the best performance. This study presents a performance model based on structured governance principles and practices.},

Explorative factor analytical methods revealed the attitude construct to be two-dimensional in both datasets, covering the domains named Commitment and Trust in both cases. Thus, the coverage of the attitude construct seemed unchanged. However, the strength of evaluation of both attitude dimensions was significantly increased. These findings have clear policy implications for agricultural cooperatives, since understanding the nature of changes in attitudes to these organizations is important for their successful development.

The author focuses on members' satisfaction, changes in governance structure in accordance with cooperative values principles and practices. The article shows the driving forces behind the change in agricultural cooperatives. The research methodology includes qualitative methods: in-depth interviews, observational narrative analysis, statistical information, and literature review. The results show that the transformation of the governance structure, in accordance with the cooperative values, principles and practices, has a direct impact on the number of Bulgarian agricultural cooperatives and the members' satisfaction/ dissatisfaction. The members' satisfaction is enhanced by the fact that cooperative principles and values are applied in practical activities, which are regulated, moreover, by the law and charters of cooperatives. If all the principles are observed and used in the operational activity of the cooperative enterprise, then such a cooperative enterprise becomes more sustainable. The facts of the reduction of cooperative membership and the enterprises themselves, in this context, can be explained by their dissatisfaction.},

Entrepreneurial organization can provide an environment in which all members can participate in entrepreneurial affairs. According to 44th principle of the constitution, a special place is given to the cooperative sector in all sectors including agriculture. The purpose of this study was identifying factors affecting the development and strengthening entrepreneurship in agricultural production cooperatives in Zanjan province. A descriptive-correlation survey approach was used in this study. The study population consists of agricultural cooperative managers. Research samples was selected using randomly stratified method with using Cochrane formula ( n=165). Reliability of instruments was determined by pilot test and calculating Cronbach alpha coefficient. Cronbach alpha values were 0.82. Validity of instrument was determined by investigating the attitudes of specialists in university and cooperative office in Zanjan. Results showed that from the perspective of managers the most important factors in strengthening entrepreneurship in agricultural cooperatives are: Providing financial support and tax breaks, reform the banking laws and making regulations to adjust with entrepreneurs conditions and preparing the document of national entrepreneurship development. Results also demonstrated that there is significant relationship between the entrepreneurial scores of managers and education level of board members, the total number of cooperatives and success level of cooperatives. One-way analysis of variance showed that there is significantly different between entrepreneurial scores of agricultural cooperatives in cities in province. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Given the principles and values that guide cooperatives, they have a greater responsibility in respecting the pillars of good governance such as transparency, integrity, and accountability. However, cooperatives may not be exempt from corruption. The objective of this paper is to assess farmers' perception of corruption in the agricultural cooperative sector and to analyse if that level depends on their personal characteristics, on farm-specific characteristics, and the relations with the cooperative. With data collected through a survey, a logistic model was estimated to analyse the impact of personal characteristics of farmers and of their farms in the odd of score very high the level of corruption in the agriculture cooperative sector. Results suggest that farmers perceive high levels of corruption and that gender, age, turnover, and seniority as members of the cooperative are relevant predictors of the said level of corruption. These results raise awareness for the greater need of social accountability, more attention for management and supervisory bodies for the ethics of governance, as well as the need to implement internal control systems.},

The cooperatives were divided into two groups: a collective marketing group for farmers and an equivalent non-marketing group that did not provide a marketing service, although other functions remained the same. Using the propensity score matching (PSM) procedure and stochastic production frontier (SPF) modelling, cooperatives' key functions that potentially increase farmers' TE can be identified. The results indicate that membership of either group is positively related to yield. However, cooperatives that were not engaged in marketing achieved higher TE than non-members. This suggests that policy makers should encourage cooperatives to focus on activities that do not include direct marketing to increase TE in apple production in China.},

The targeted key performance indicators (KPI) for the Core Strategic V of National Cooperative Policy 2011 - 2020 stated that, at least 90% of the co-operatives have audited annual financial report and 90% of the co-operatives conduct the annual general meeting. This study addresses a question, does educational background and training attained has a relationship with the competency of the BOD in ensuring the effectiveness of financial reporting? Based on previous literature, competency is believed to be influenced by individual educational background and training attended. 42 cooperatives on agriculture based in the whole state of Perak were selected in this study, however only 258 questionnaires were returned. Hierarchical regression analysis technique was used, and the result shows that there is a significant relationship between education background and training attained by the BOD member with their competency in managing the agriculture cooperative society activities in state of Perak.

The aim of this study was to evaluate institutional relations and information between the various actors within the agricultural knowledge and information system (AKIS). The study focused on eight actors within the AKIS in Dakahlia governorate of Egypt, namely policy, extension, research, agricultural cooperatives, higher education, secondary education, credit, and the private sector. Thus, the survey sample included 11 representatives of each actor with 88 respondents. Data were collected by a standardized questionnaire distributed online. The graph theoretical technique was used for the quantitative assessment of information flow and institutional linkages established among actors. The findings indicated that agricultural extension ranked first about their real cause and effect on the rest of the system, having a value of 7.95. Two critical information pathways within the AKIS sustained innovation outcomes: (1) higher education-extension-agricultural cooperatives, (2) research-extension-agricultural cooperatives. The results also revealed that agricultural cooperatives ranked second after the extension component on the extent of supplying information to other members in the AKIS, with a value of 4.8. In contrast, the highest component received information from other components (7.6). By analyzing institutional linkages and information flow, this article gives insights to policymakers on the mechanisms that still need to be strengthened and the information gaps between actors to address the challenges of sustainable rural development.},

Although the consensus from the literature suggests that participating in these organizations significantly affects farm production, there is inconclusive evidence on whether this effect is positive or negative. Moreover, previous studies solely focus on the magnitude of this effect and fail to explain the mechanism behind it. This study contributes to this knowledge gap by estimating the impact of agricultural cooperatives on farm profits. To do this, we apply the causal mediation analysis to explain the potential mechanism behind this relationship. Using a nationally representative survey of farm households from Taiwan in 2013, we find that participating in cooperatives increases farm profits. Furthermore, this effect is more pronounced for producers with higher profits. Concerning the mechanism, we find that the use of food labels accounts for approximately 15 to 28% of the total effect of cooperative participation on farm profits.},

The cooperative sector, although guided by principles of solidarity, democratic control, member economic participation, mutualism and transparency, may not be free from corruption. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the perception of corrupt and similar practices in agricultural cooperatives in Northern Portugal by its members, their perception of corruption in the agricultural sector, and if this perception is different according to their socio-demographic profile, business characteristics and relationships with the cooperative. Additionally, it is intended to group cooperators according to their level of perceived corruption and investigate the characteristics of these clusters. Through the results of a survey, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses followed by a cluster analysis were performed. The results suggest that cooperators have dissatisfaction with the quality of management and alerts for the existence of corruption. Differences in the level of perceived corruption may be more due to differences in the dimension of their farms, family involvement, the dependency of the cooperative and seniority as a member than to their socio-demographic characteristics. It was possible to find three significant distinct clusters of members according to their opinion about corruption. Although the importance of agricultural cooperatives and the nobility of the principles of the cooperative movement, this article warns of ethical failures that can have the consequent reputational loss.},

This study decomposes the membercooperative relationship into four organizational mechanismsmarket, hierarchy, community and democracy, which all play a role in generating commitment. Data originate from 148 farmers, all members of the same agricultural cooperative in Brazil. The results suggest first, that it is possible to disentangle commitment to collective action from commitment to a customer-oriented strategy. Second, although members commitment to a customer-oriented strategy might be affected by market and hierarchy mechanisms only, commitment to collective action might depend on the four organizational mechanisms.

Using primary data from a field survey of cattle farmers in China, this paper empirically examines the impact of policy cognition on livestock farmers' investment in manure recycling facilities. The impact is tested through the multiple mediator model to accommodate two potential mediating mechanisms, which are the agricultural cooperative membership and land leasing. Three conclusions arise. First, policy cognition has a significant posi-tive impact on both the diversification and amounts of farmers' investment in manure recycling facilities. Second, membership in agricultural cooperatives and participation in land leasing are two important mediating mecha-nisms for policy cognition to affect farmers' investment decisions on manure recycling. Finally, for the two medi-ating variables, leasing additional agricultural land promotes more investment in manure recycling facilities, but less in investment diversification, while cooperative membership has the opposite impact. This study contributes to three areas of literature on the factors affecting investment decisions, the mediating effects of policy cognition and the investment in non-production related assets. Regarding policy implications, we identify the importance of promoting policy awareness and agricultural cooperatives among livestock farmers, as well as developing land lease markets in agricultural regions in promoting investment in manure recycling facilities.

This analysis draws mainly on data from the parliamentary debates that preceded the enactment of three pivotal laws. In comparing the debates in 1991/1992 and 1995, the examination focuses on the shift in the argumentation put forward by representatives speaking on behalf of cooperative farms. A dramatic shift in reasoning about the character of cooperative enterprises and appropriate voting rights is interpreted as a pragmatic, effect-oriented action. It is argued that both delicate work with the hybrid nature of post-socialist cooperative farms as well as the initial withholding of cooperative principles contributed to the preservation of the specific kinds of agricultural cooperative, and consequently also large corporate farm, which now exist in Slovakia.},

The main results indicated that the agricultural cooperatives in the sample hired independent auditor by reasons such as: detect human error, detect accounting mistakes, technical accounting help, provide more security of accounting information to users, detect fraud in management, detect fraud, avoid fraud, provide more transparency between the members, bank requirement, competitive advantage, motivate accounting time and to provide easier access to credit. In addition, we detected that 68.75% of the presidents and 45.83% of the fiscal councils presented motivations related to agency relations in their responses.

Nearly ten percent of the respondents used other ICT applications such as WhatsApp (7.33 percent) and Facebook (11.33 percent) for seeking agricultural information. It was also found that pesticide dealers and private companies' representatives were the major sources for seeking information by respondents. Majority of the respondents (82.00 percent) were members of agricultural co-operative societies in their villages. Farm literature, TV telecast and radio broadcasts were some other information sources utilized by the Bt cotton farmers in Punjab state. It was also found that area and productivity of Bt cotton at the fields of respondents started decreasing gradually due to decreased yields, price fluctuations, leading to lower gross income of the respondents. Study suggests that the pesticide dealers and personnel of agricultural cooperative societies need to be regularly trained for providing scientific farm information to the Bt cotton farmers of the state.},

But during the process of co-ops there exists the problem of attracting more producers to join by improving its competence with the IOF. In this paper we present a simple two-stages mixed duopsonies model where the co-op and IOF compete in the input market. The impact on member commitment of pricing strategy of co-op and IOF are analyzed through the comparison of welfare of members. The results indicate that the objective set by co-op affects the pricing strategy as well as agent efficiency of co-op, which then has significant effect on member commitment.

However, research on the observed survival of farmer cooperatives in spite of their weaknesses and limitations is scarce, in part because academic attention to cooperative performance has been static and introspective. Using evidence collected from case studies and print media publications, this paper contributes to the literature with a qualitative study of farmer cooperatives which spurred survival and longevity by means of strategic adaptation in response to four current developments in the external environment: industry consolidation, consumer segmentation, price volatility, and policy change. The qualitative study concludes farmer cooperatives in general respond to such developments by means of organizational growth. Common strategies are vertical integration, geographic expansion, and portfolio diversification. While survival and longevity are promoted in theory, strategic adaptation also often facilitates the pursuit of investor-oriented as opposed to user-oriented objectives. In some scenarios, member ownership and control may become burdensome to the business and prompt conversion to another structure if further adaptation to internal and external developments is unsuccessful. More research is therefore needed to explore the dynamic and variable impact of strategy on cooperative survival.},

In this case, the cooperative acts as a mechanism for rural development. The defining feature is that the mechanism of integrated development of rural territory to provide a comprehensive solution to the problems of the economy of the area and settlement, the formation and increase of investment attractiveness of the territory of the rural settlement and the creation of a working climate for private business are agricultural cooperatives. Analyzing the state of cooperation in the context of the European integration tendencies, which currently permeate the agrarian sector of the Ukrainian economy, studying the experience of cooperation among farmers of the European countries can be useful both from the point of view of its adaptation to domestic realities, and from the point of view of the most significant mistakes in development and miscalculations in rural areas. In addition, marketing studies have been conducted in rural areas of Ukraine, which have revealed the most significant areas of rural settlement development, including the creation and development of enterprises of meat, construction, tourism and recreational clusters and the development of joint ventures as growth points that activate the development of small and medium-sized businesses around them and the formation of interregional ties and rural cooperatives. Methods. Creating an agricultural consumer supply cooperative is the most effective mechanism for developing identified growth points and creating infrastructure to support them in rural Ukraine. The basis for the construction of an agricultural cooperative in rural areas is the formation of a model of maximum cost reduction for all members of the cooperative. Results. The further development and effective management of the cooperatives will contribute to solving socio-economic problems, improving the well-being of the peasants and, as a consequence, ensuring the integrated development of rural areas. Value/originality. Analyzing the activities of agricultural cooperatives operating in the world, we point out that research on the institutional foundations of the cooperative and its functioning as a mechanism of economic self-regulation give reason to claim that the cooperative does not have sufficient state support for its development. As a consequence, the number of cooperatives is steadily decreasing, we believe that the cooperative system of interaction of economic agents in the agricultural sector should include nationwide programmatic measures on institutional adaptation of cooperation as a mechanism of market self-regulation, a special form of integration, institutional mechanism for regulating entrepreneurship and the basis of cooperation, rules, traditions, organizations and institutions, the task of which is to determine the behavior of economic entities for the sake of satisfaction individual and social goals in the system of production and exchange of goods and services.},

An informal conversation was held in sequence in order to understand the familiarity with the procedures studied. The results demonstrate that the institution's managers use concepts from the two performance evaluation models. However, they are not used in a standardized way by all managers, that is, they are used in some sectors and not in others. Still, it was found that these tools complement each other in the performance evaluation process in the analyzed cooperative, but that this use is instinctive, as soon as they demonstrated ignorance of the institutionalized use of the models.},

We present a mathematical programming formulation of the model that represents the logistics management problem. As solving the exact model is computationally expensive, we opt for a hybrid heuristic approach that first uses an insertion heuristic algorithm to obtain an initial solution and then improvement processes are performed using the so-called simulated annealing metaheuristic. We have built a graphical interface that allows easy use of the system and, in particular, efficient post-optimality analysis. Moreover, this interface can easily interface with other management tools. The utility of our model is shown with real and simulated data sets.},

This paper examines the differences in financial level of these two categories (mandatory cooperatives versus traditional agricultural cooperatives) with the help of a financial approach, which is based on panel data analysis techniques. Several notions and concepts forming the financial engineering methodological framework are adopted for the design of this approach.

Case studies of four cooperatives serve as illustrations. There is a large amount of social capital in these cooperatives, with their operations simple enough to allow members to be involved. The supplying members (common members) are few and well acquainted with one another. They have close relationships with those individuals (core members) who have the dominating ownership and who run the cooperatives. These case cooperatives were chosen because they have innovative financial solutions. For example, members let their private assets and those of the cooperative constitute joint collateral when money is borrowed from financial institutions. In another case, the members trust each other sufficiently for there to be a mutual fund that lends money both to members and their cooperative. Yet another model involves members having low demands concerning capital returns when lending to their cooperative.},

With a cohort of 421 farmer members in the Kampong Speu and Pursat provinces of Cambodia, household surveys were designed to consider how factors influence local engagement. It was discovered that: (i) local engagement in ACs operations is limited, and management of boards of directors is a critical constraint to motivating local involvement; (ii) local engagement in ACs operations is associated with access to water, benefits from ACs, participation in ACs activities, risk control and ACs management, and ACs operations do not promote access to agricultural inputs; and (iii) ACs operations have faced several constraints, including poor management, inadequate capital accumulation, unavailable loans, loan mismanagement, a lack of skills, high illiteracy levels, small share values, a lack of access to credit facilities, access to the competitive market and a lack of support from extension services. This empirical study, with implications from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), addresses a gap in the literature by exploring engagement in ACs operations.},

The final model illustrates nine significant relationships, including satisfaction and long-term commitment. The result suggests the long-term survival or viability of farmer cooperatives is not only dependent on its financial performance but also the utility of its members. In terms of member attitudes and perceptions, trust and mission support may offer the best opportunities for farmer cooperatives to foster member satisfaction and thus address the negative consequences of heterogeneity.},

This crisis is characterized by three adverse effects on the relationship between the cooperative and its associates: complexity, distance, and confusion.

The sample consisted of 129 agricultural cooperatives, headquartered in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana. Data collection was conducted by questionnaire containing 81 questions divided into three blocks. As for the approach to the research problem, the study is mainly quantitative. Corporate governance mechanisms (MGC) were determined from the guidelines issued by the Brazilian Institute of Corporate Governance (IBGC) and included: the participation of cooperative members, the board of directors, the executive board, the audit and fiscal council. The CVO were determined from Miller and Friesen's (1984) theory: birth, growth, maturity, rejuvenation and decline. For the data analysis procedure, we used descriptive analysis, application of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and multinomial logistic regression. The research findings demonstrate a development of corporate governance mechanisms, participation from cooperatives and the board of directors, in the initial stages and weakening participation from the stage of maturity. Although results are limited in terms of statistical significance, the other mechanisms still have significant participation within the cooperatives' corporate governance structure.},

Using large sample data from Jilin Province, this paper examines the decision-making mechanism of farmers in joining cooperatives and analyzes farmers' awareness of cooperatives and relative laws, willingness to participate, real behaviors and performance in cooperatives. Empirical results show that farmers' education level, the variety of agricultural products, planting area, future planting plan, sales difficulties, low prices of agricultural products, labor shortage, agricultural production costs and risks are the most influential factors in deciding what behaviors to take, while planting area, agricultural production costs, the variety of agricultural products and lack of agricultural insurance are the most influential factors deciding the final performance achieved.

We analyse a self-managed practice that embraces assembly, community and solidarity values.

The Polish communist regime didn't abolish private farm ownership and agricultural cooperatives have a long tradition. Polish cooperatives undertake more joint activities, such as processing and financing investment for members, while Romanian ones limit themselves to raw milk production. Some of the problems Romanian and Polish organizations are facing are common. Additionally, Polish cooperatives are also facing problems related to their milk processing activities. Romanian cooperatives must think of vertical integration and include processing in their activities, as a necessary step for development and for gaining more negotiating power in the milk chain.},

The observed differences between the human factor variables that determine the innovative and cooperation propensity of agricultural cooperatives' members in contrast to social purpose enterprises' members illustrate the presence of different channels through which public sector-social actor cooperation in the filed might be built. Important insights for decision making in the field are provided.},

    abstract = {In developing countries, producer organizations (POs) are important for achieving women empowerment mainly through promoting women's access to the organization's resources and services. However, by improving access to markets and technologies, household membership in POs often results in commercialization of smallholder farming, leading to women disempowerment as men take over control of the farm. We use data from dairy smallholders in Kenya to explore the impact of membership in bargaining and processing POs on women empowerment. Applying the Women Empowerment Livestock Index, we capture six domains of empowerment: production; nutrition; resources; income; opportunities; and workload. We find that when a household joins any PO, regardless of whether the man or the woman in the household is the registered member, women achieve a higher control over production decisions, buying and selling of land and cows, use of loans and receiving dairy income. Distinguishing by gender of membership, there is stronger women empowerment when the woman in the household is a member. We also find that woman membership in bargaining POs results in greater empowerment, in terms of ownership of cows, than woman membership in processing POs. The paper suggests that women empowerment is affected by the functional characteristics of POs.},

The province of Almeria, Spain, is an example of smallholding rapid development due to the expansion of intensive greenhouse horticulture. It was the poorest Spanish province per capita in 1955, semi-arid, drought-ridden, and devoid of significant infrastructure. Its undereducated population held little promise for economic growth and a massive migration out of the province left it depopulated. Subsequent economic and social development of Almeria was closely tied to the establishment of both credit and agricultural cooperatives, which supported a new greenhouse agriculture for small plot family farmers organized around cooperatives. This paper focuses on how cooperatives were fundamental in constructing civil society for the benefit of poor rural people, even in the presence of significant negative social capital and undemocratic institutions during the Franco dictatorship. As the sector has modernized and matured, cooperatives have led the sustainable transformation of the business ecosystem. However, current shortcomings in the Almeria cooperative movement and civil society and challenges yet to be met are also raised.},

    abstract = {Productivity growth is essential for food security and sustainable development of agriculture. Since rice is a major staple food in China, understanding factors affecting the performance of rice total factor productivity (TFP) is of great importance for China's future food security. Despite the growing importance of agricultural TFP, rigorous evidence-based studies on the impacts of cooperative membership on agricultural TFP, especially rice TFP, are scant, hindering the understanding about the potential contribution of agricultural cooperatives to TFP growth. This study examines the impacts of cooperative membership on rice productivity in China by using country-representative survey data from 2014 to 2018. An endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias. The empirical results show that cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact not only on rice TFP but also on TFP change, technical change and technical efficiency change. The results are robust to alternative choice of instrument variables. The effects of cooperatives on rice productivity are highly heterogeneous with regard to regions, farm scales and mechanization levels. Rice TFP gains through cooperatives are larger for producers in the eastern and central regions, while the effect on TFP growth is the highest in the western region. Regarding farm scales, cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact on rice TFP for small and medium farms but not for large farms. Moreover, cooperatives help improve rice productivity for provinces with low mechanization level of producers. This study further explores the underlying channels through which cooperative membership impacts rice productivity, and identifies that mechanical cultivation, high-quality inputs and technical training appear to be the main channels.

Another relevant conclusion is how a cooperative's business strategies relate to the type of services that the cooperative.

An ordered multi classification logistic regression model was utilized to empirically analyze the association between the variables. The results showed that social networks have a significant positive impact on the households' participation in cooperatives/communities. Among other variables, network interaction, network learning, network trust, and households' participation in green energy technologies and cooperatives/community showed significant and positive correlation, but the variable network reciprocity was found to be negatively correlated to the adoption of green energy technologies. Study findings further revealed that, there is an interaction effect in the participation of households' behavioral decision-making and joining cooperatives. Furthermore, the social experience of the head of the household and the source of income of the family showed a significant positive association with households' participation in cooperatives/communities.

Stochastic frontier models were used to estimate the relative level of efficiency and to relate it with cooperativism level measured as participatory decision-making and integration to cooperatives' networks. Results showed that the former dimension of cooperativism presented a positive effect that dominated the negative effect of network integration. So that efficiency (weakly) increased with an index aggregating the two cooperativism's dimensions. This was coherent with case studies attesting Brazilian cooperatives capacity to overcome threats to efficiency with organizational changes including the introduction of probation, dismissing and hiring of non-member workers, thus preserving core principles. Results were also consistent with theoretical studies which both argue that shirking and high transaction costs are the main threats to efficiency facing cooperatives and also that these are mitigatable by common principles fostering consensus and a participatory environment minimizing conflicts and disclosing private information. Government support to creation of cooperatives is recommendable as a poverty alleviation policy whether homogeneous social groups more prone to mutual trust are prioritized.},

The farmer is required to purchase a certain amount of shares within specific limits to join in the co-op. The equity investment entitles the right to deliver a particular amount of qualified raw commodity in proportion, and the shares are transferable and appreciable. We consider a multi-period model in which the farmer first considers a one-time decision on participation (whether to join in the co-op). If yes, the farmer determines the production capacity and the initial equity investment in addition to the periodic production planning and equity investment adjustment when yield, spot prices, and share price are uncertain. We propose the condition under which the farmer shall participate in the co-op and characterize the optimal capacity and equity investment policies in closed form. We also investigate how the transferability of shares affects the farmer's optimal decisions and profitability by fixing the initial equity investment. Further, we examine the performance of a variety of heuristic policies when the quality requirement or the yield uncertainty is ignored. The results provide insights into a farmer's decision making, production planning, and cash management. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Both positive and negative effects of social capital on performances of farmer cooperatives are observed. To be specific, bonding social capital is positively associated with common members' economic benefits. Bridging social capital generates beneficial outcomes for the financial and social performances of cooperatives, while exhibiting negative influence on common members' income increase because of member heterogeneity.},

This is underlined by agricultural cooperatives in Germany, a major EU grower, farmer and producer, at the forefront of agricultural excellence. Agricultural cooperatives are associations of farmers and family farms working together on the land. They are established by law to increase efficiency and strengthen market positions. At the same time, they take responsibility for all aspects of the environment, thereby preserving the landscape and preserving the biodiversity of plant and animal species. On the one hand, many cooperatives use the latest technologies in fields such as farming, fertilization, plant protection, and the introduction of digitalization in the production process promotes the development of environmentally friendly management. After German reunification, existing economic units were dissolved or converted. Those who continued their activities took the legal form of agricultural producers' cooperatives, sponsored and represented by the Cooperative Audit Association and the German Association of Raiffeisen.

We derive the optimal contract to elicit the quality and quantity incentives for producers, depending on whether the DS firm directly deals with producers or indirectly deals with them through a producer-owned cooperative. We find that when the DS firm directly deals with producers via secret contracts, the opportunistic behavior of the DS firm on producers leads to lower quality and quantity levels. The opportunistic behavior is prevented when the DS firm deals with the producer cooperative. However, the contract should offer a sufficiently high quality payment to overcome the free-riding inefficiency of the producer members.},

In this article, we propose an original approach which consists in solving first local viability problems and then studying the real viability of the combination of the local strategies, by simulation where necessary. In this article, we consider as multilevel viability problem a stylized agricultural cooperative which has to keep a minimum of members. Members have an economical constraint and some members have a simple model of the functioning of the cooperative and make assumptions on other members' behavior, especially proviable agents which are concerned about their own viability. In this framework, the model assumptions allow us to solve the local viability problem at the agent level. At the cooperative level, considering mixture of agents, simulation results indicate if and when including proviable agents increases the viability of the whole cooperative.

Leadership was analysed from multiple perspectives using an explanatory sequential mixed approach involving quantitative and qualitative methods. We interviewed 293 cooperative leaders and members. The partial least squares structural equation model was used to examine the relationship between multiple constructs and variables. We concluded that leaders do differ in some of their characteristics from other members. They are the most active in the group, influencing all major decisions, playing a crucial role in trust-building and group cohesion. Their skills and leadership style are significantly important for members' commitment to the group's success. However, the dominance of group founders and lack of understanding of cooperative principles among members indicate some emerging challenges to the cooperatives' sustainability and efficiency, and it is necessary to focus on the progressive professionalization and capacity building of leaders while maintaining a transformational leadership style.},

    abstract = {To maintain and increase small producers' competitiveness, Zagreb County has successfully established a Distribution Center for Fruit and Vegetables (DCVP) in cooperation with Velika Gorica and the agricultural cooperative Zagrebacki Vocnjaci. Registered as a limited liability company, the center provides long-term product storage, product preparation for the market, and sales management. Despite a small share of ownership and management of this distribution company, fruit and vegetable producers benefit from increased sales security, extended sales periods, and secure collection. DCVP assures customers of higher product quality, which, combined with the extended selling period, leads to the increased selling price. Over the period 2009-2019, DCVP steadily increased its total assets by keeping its gearing ratio below 50%. DCVP reduces the number of days to collect receivables and the number of days to pay suppliers, i.e., farmers. A satisfactory liquidity level is achieved during the observed period, but the center's profitability is low. The average ROA during 2015-2019 is 0.07%. However, it should be emphasized that this institution's primary objective is not to maximize profits but to ensure a better position of small producers of fruits and vegetables in the market. The interviews conducted show a high level of satisfaction of the co-owners and the management with the center's achievements so far. Based on the results, we conclude that the DCVP is an excellent example for future public-private cooperation projects to increase domestic fruit and vegetable producers' competitiveness. The main recommendation for future projects is to involve producers in the decision-making process and develop accompanying activities to train farmers in new technologies and strengthen farmers' cooperation.},

    abstract = {The cooperative movement in Venezuela reached unprecedented levels of growth with the adoption of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (1999) and the Cooperatives Act (2001). By 2006 there were 108,000 cooperatives, and the figure rose to 306,792 in 2011 estimated that by 2013 only about 40,000 will survive, mainly due to the lack of consideration of associated labor and other cooperative values. These data justify the need to analyze the cooperative principles in the success of agricultural cooperatives in Zulia State. The research was conducted in the counties located at the South of Maracaibo's Lake, a questionnaire to 51 cooperatives and interview to cooperative specialists were applied. Overall rate of success factors (IGFE), index review of success factors (IOE), and the index of productive activities (IAP) which have been subjected to correlation and means tests: success rates were constructed. The results emphasize that the principles with high average values and statistical significance in successful cooperatives are democratic management (0.7059), equal economic participation of partners (0.5233), education, training and information (0.4560), cooperation between cooperatives (0.4882) and commitment to the communities (0.3331). A significant correlation (P<0.01) between the IGFE (0.598) and IOE (0.598) with the dependent variable IAP was observed. It was concluded that the application of cooperative principles in the constitution and organization of cooperatives has been a condition of success.},

Several researchers assert that member interest in cooperative governance is related to social factors. The empirical basis consists of surveys of random samples of Swedish farmers conducted in 1993, 2003, and 2013. The results indicate a strong relationship between the social networks and the farmers' propensity to participate in cooperative governance. This relationship has persisted even though the investigated 20-year period was very turbulent for Swedish agriculture. Over time, members have become more willing to be elected when they receive backing from their social networks, with personal networks being more important than professional networks. The professional networks are related only to the level of aspiration and not actual participation in governance. [EconLit Citations: D73, P13, Q13].},

The results showed that the practices of the 1 and 2 stages were the most used / valued by the respondents, since the average levels of use (62% and 64.67%, respectively) approached those of importance 65.00% and 72.25%). However, those practices belonging to the 3 and 4 stages were effectively underused and less valued by the Controllers, since the average degrees of importance (42.75% and 47.25%, respectively) exceeded the respective average levels of Use (9.67% and 13.67%). Also, with regard to the life cycle, evidence has been found that leads us to believe in the association of the practices used in the life stages of these cooperatives, especially those classified in the Maturity phases (D, E and F And Maturity / Decline (A and C), but less evident in those in the Maturity / Growth stratum (B and G).},

Encouraging farmers to self-organize was regarded as a useful tool to enhance the adoption of agricultural product certifications in Taiwan. However, previous studies solely focused on the association between membership in a production organization and single food certifications. Moreover, little is known of how different types of organizational participation could improve the adoption of agricultural product certifications. This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by employing multinomial logistic regression model (MNL) to investigate factors affecting farmers' decisions to participate in agricultural product certification. Special attention is paid to the role of different types of organizational participation in farmers' choices for agricultural product certification. The study used a nationally representative sample of core farmers in Taiwan, and its results revealed evident differences in farmers' organization types. For example, the farm operators who participate in agricultural cooperatives (co-ops) tend to use organic labels. In contrast, farm operators who participate in agricultural production and marketing groups (APMGs) tend to adopt the Traceable Agricultural Products (TAP) label. Moreover, age, education level, farming experience, farm labor, farm type, agricultural facilities, and regional location have a significant effect on farmers' choices for participating in agricultural product certification across different models. The findings suggest that policymakers should consider these differences in the organizational operation of APMGs and co-ops and provide customized measures by promoting different types of agricultural product certifications.},

We find significant differences between these firms, with slower adjustment rates for current and debt ratios in cooperatives. These findings may arise from the weakness associated with ownership structure in cooperatives, which reduces their adjustment processes compared to those of IOFs. The identification of differences in adjustment processes between cooperatives and IOFs may provide us with additional information regarding the specific management characteristics of these agri-food firms, thus identifying those firms that are most dependent on external market conditions.},

This research aims to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) of farmers in the GAP-Harran Plain for services that would ensure sustainable agricultural income, the factors affecting their willingness, and the minimum amount they would be willing to pay. The main material of the research has been obtained by means of face-to-face surveys involving farmers selected by a simple random sampling method in the GAP-Harran Plain. The sampling volume was determined with a 95% confidence limit and a 5% error margin. Heckman's two-stage model was used for the analysis. According to the results of the research, 22.61% of the participants showed WTP, and the average amount they were willing to pay was 180.82 TL/hectare (ha) ($31.86/ha). This amount was 3.08% of the average annual agricultural income calculated. About 41.22% of the participants showed no WTP. They believed that the public sector is accountable of the services and consequently, they should be provided free of charge. About 23.14% of the participants showed WTP only for the services that they needed. The average WTP for all participants was calculated as 40.9 TL/ha ($7.21/ha) and 1.2 million $/year for the GAP-Harran Plain. This amount is the minimum and may increase by several folds with a demand-based variety of service delivery. The factors that statistically effect WTP have been determined as age, education, experience, number of households working in agriculture, amount of land, agricultural income, non-agricultural income, membership status of agricultural cooperatives, and product pattern. The results provide useful information to guide researchers, decision-makers, and policy-makers.},

The divergence is puzzling given strong similarities in Japan and Korea's agricultural sectors and institutions. Electoral competition that accentuates the urban-rural divide in society works in favor of centralized farm political mobilization, whereas electoral competition that minimizes the urban-rural divide works in favor of decentralized farm political mobilization. The logic is that when electoral competition cuts across the urban-rural cleavage, farmers face greater challenges in mobilizing under a centralized farm group for electoral purposes. Simply put, farmers are unable to act as a unified voting bloc. Relatedly, political parties also face less electoral incentives to specifically target farmers as a unified voting bloc.},

The main purpose of this empirical study is to investigate the most important factors that motivate Greek producers to participate in marketing cooperatives, as well as those motives that discourage them. The prefecture of Imathia, in the northern part of Greece, was chosen because it is characterized by a high involvement of cooperatives, wholesalers and retailers in F&V trading. A structured questionnaire was answered by 61 producers of Imathia in 2020. The results indicate that producers recognize that they ensure safer financial transactions and direct distribution of their fresh agricultural produce via marketing cooperatives. Moreover, the study showed that there is a statistically significant difference in the motives of participation in a marketing cooperative that has bargaining power and direct distribution of fresh agricultural produce between the three categories of education level. However, producers appeared to agree that (1) the great divergence in members' reasons for participation in a marketing cooperative and (2) the inability to take collective decisions by the general assembly are the most important disincentives for participation in marketing cooperatives.},

It has now been recognized that producer cooperatives might possess paradoxical potentials of promoting egalitarian economy and democratic management whilst at the same time constructing class hierarchies. So far, agrarian scholars have already identified how pre-existing social differentiation facilitated privileged members to exploit the marginal non-members. However, they have not explored how members exercise their agency in challenging the class division. In summer 2013, at the height of China's cooperatization movement, I embarked on a project of engaged anthropology to mobilize shrimp farmers in South China to establish a cooperative so as to challenge agribusinesses that squeeze farmers' returns, but members ended up hiring outside labour. However, members tried hard to bridge the hierarchy between investors and workers as well as between managers and labourers in order to expand its membership and build the village's reputation. This paper traces how cooperative members deal with the dilemmas between profit maximization and egalitarian distribution, highlighting the importance of class analysis for a pro-poor cooperative movement.},

He finds that codetermination laws are negatively associated with productivity, but profit sharing, worker ownership, and worker participation in decision making are all positively associated with productivity.

The analysis focusses on the dimensions of economic control, voice and agency, and shows that co-operatives can promote inclusion. However, co-operatives are inevitably influenced by the wider context in which they are constituted and are therefore part of an ongoing, and often contradictory, process of change. These dynamics need to be understood and addressed by members, co-operative leaders and policy-makers alike, as well as international organisations supporting co-operative development.},

It is shown that social interactions mitigate the free-riding effect of pooling and that the amount of members' social interactions depends upon, and increases with, the cooperative's pooling ratio. We show that the complete pooling policy is not only economically efficient but also socially advantageous when the context of the cooperative is conducive to frequent social interactions among members.},

This paper establishes a typology of cooperative exporters based on a sample of 45 Spanish citrus cooperatives and analyses the existence of significant differences between them based on their knowledge of markets, market orientation and innovation. The results show that there are differences in knowledge of markets among those cooperatives that export through second grade cooperatives and those who export directly.

The element design of this proposed framework has considered three key principles, which are (1) smart members, (2) the smart economy, and (3) smart governance. A smart co-operative is a term used to extend the concept of a smart city into co-operative organization to promote a sustainable development approach in the co-operative sector. Therefore, the smart co-operative combines ICT, smart concepts, co-operative business aspects, business models, and innovation. The findings suggest that the smart and sustainable development co-operative framework is suitable for co-operatives, providing a comprehensive framework for value creation through the smart co-operative concept.},

The results demonstrated that the return of erosion is likely due to the absence of crop rotation in favor of repetitive year-to-year planting of the same plant species (early soybean/main [second harvest]/wheat), soil revolving to decompress the surface layer, and the elimination of agricultural terraces and the consequential downslope planting.},

The objective was to implement certain rapeseed cultivation operations that had shown their efficiency in previous studies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: (i) the use of decision support systems (DSS) to calculate nitrogen fertilisation rates, (ii) the cultivation of legumes as intercrops with rapeseed or (iii) as previous crops. This paper first presents an estimate of the potential GHG effects of these cultivation operations, using results from previous studies obtained under experimental conditions or using crop modelling. It then presents the level of adoption by farmers of these cultivation operations in the context of the Demarche de progres DIESTER (R) initiative to continuously improve the environmental performance of rapeseed biodiesel. Depending on the year, 39 to 74 agricultural cooperatives and grain trading companies were involved in the study, and 90 170 to 283 480 hectares of rapeseed have been monitored. This is the first time in France that an attempt to improve cultivation operations for environmental reasons has been made on such a scale. The average GHG reduction values, compared to fossil fuels, varied from 49.5 to 55.8% depending on the year, which was most often above the 50% minimum reduction value for sustainable biodiesel, but well below the 70% minimum for very low GHG emission biodiesel. Using the results of previous studies, this article shows that the widespread use of decision support systems to calculate mineral N fertilizer rates, and the cultivation of legumes as a preceding crop or intercrop, would make it possible to significantly reduce GHGs and make it possible to produce very low GHG-emitting biodiesel in certain locations and/or years. However, the actual changes in cultural operations were too small to be effective. The reasons for this lack of impact and how to achieve results in the future are discussed in this article.},

We assume that the legal form of a farm determinates the level of the agency costs. There were three measures used: the ratio of operational expanses to annual sales, sales-to-total assets ratio and return on equity. Using MANCOVA and ANCOVA techniques, we find that the legal form of a farm is a relevant determinant of agency costs level. We also conclude that the use of operational expanses to annual sales ratio is recommended only in industries in which its mean value in long run is lower than 1.},

A priority-based max-min heuristic (PMMH) is proposed to solve this problem. A social objective of the PMMH is to minimise the standard deviation of the revenue per greenhouse. The proposed heuristic reduces this standard deviation in the solution by reallocating crops among the greenhouses of the farmers, especially those farmers with very high or very low revenues. The PMMH is tested on various problem scenarios. The solutions obtained with the PMMH provide better objective function values than those from What's Best solver. The results also show that the revenue per greenhouse is affected by the number of greenhouses per farmer.},

In addition, agricultural cooperation stimulates the development of agrarian market infrastructure, plays an exceptional role in strengthening the economic potential, competitiveness and social status of agricultural producers, improving economic conditions and creating incentives for the growth of commodity products. However, so far its development is at a low level, the main reasons being the underestimation in the process of economic reforms of cooperative forms of economic activity, general unfavorable conditions for agricultural production, psychological unwillingness of peasants to cooperate and insufficient knowledge of the rural population about the benefits of cooperation, weak state support for small businesses in agribusiness and agricultural cooperatives. Methods. The countries of the West in every way stimulate the development of cooperation: by appropriate laws, privileges, subsidies. Ukraine needs to take the example from these countries in order to develop the cooperative movement, which will stimulate rural development. Results. Ukraine is trying to build on the experience of different countries in the field of agricultural cooperation, backing up on the best of the countries studied. Practical implications. Studies have shown that world experience convinces that cooperation has contributed to the development of many countries in the world.

    abstract = {This dataset presents data collected from joint cropland management practices survey in agri-food cooperatives of Mediterranean Spanish Regions. The objective was to examine to what extent cooperatives offer joint services, including joint management or integral exploitation of smallholdings, for the incorporation of new professionals. Data collection was conducted to five agri-food organizations: three agri-food cooperatives federations -Castilla-La Mancha, Comunitat Valenciana, and Murcia-, two second-degree agrifood cooperatives -Anecoop and UnioNuts-, all of them located in Mediterranean Spanish Regions. A total of 1.168 survey questionnaires were distributed between July 2020 and February 2021 across five organizations through the snowball sampling method. Data from 112 collected questionnaires were correctly answered, but 106 were selected for analysis. The dataset includes socioeconomic data, productive information, and innovative characteristics from agri-food cooperatives surveyed, all in order to be able to examine the relationship between those factors and joint cropland management practices they carry on.

After indivisible capital components and their economic importance in Slovenian cooperatives are analysed on the basis of financial statements for the year 2019, the legal framework for each category of indivisible capital is studied more in detail, addressing not only the purpose and use of such capital but also issues of governance. As the indivisible capital benefits not only the current but also future generations of members, special attention is paid to external control mechanisms and other broader discussed issues of sustainable management of indivisible capital in cooperatives.},

Following the Transaction Costs Economics framework, the paper aims to investigate which are the main drivers of the collective forms of organization in the Italian agro-food system, paying particular attention to transaction costs' attributes and to the increasing role played by the institutional environment as well. The choice to join a cooperative or producer organization is therefore conceptualized as a governance structure choice. In this regard, based on the Italian version of the Farm Accountancy Data Network, econometric models are estimated in order to account for the two organizational alternatives under investigation.},

We apply this framework to two case studies: an open-air market promoting short food supply chains in France, and a partnership between an agricultural cooperative and several solidarity purchase groups (GAS) in Italy. Analysing the trajectories of the two initiatives, we highlight the processes through which new economic models are jointly built via interactions between different actors. Our results open two lines of discussion: one concerning the 'new economic models' that emerge from the two cases, a second regarding the actors' participation in elaborating and enacting these new models.},

The analysis is based on the perceptions of supply chain leaders about the challenges to improving the industry's competitiveness. The paper also presents various strategies already implemented by some actors to overcome such barriers to competitiveness. The empirical results have manifold implications. One of which is that the problems and strategies must be the target of managers and authorities in a sustainable common project of development to the benefit of the whole dairy supply chain.},

Secondly, to evaluate the Paris principles in terms of dynamic processes rather than simply outcomes, thus entailing the need for systemic evaluations, also through participatory methods. The Ethio-Italian cooperation project Agricultural Value Chains in Oromia'' is analysed as a case study, assessing its coherence with the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness by involving stakeholders at different levels. Overall, the project's focus on transformative quality-oriented value chain processes is proved to substantially shape dynamic multi-stakeholder interactions in enhancing Paris principles at local, national and international levels.},

The dominant heritage narrative (depicting Lake County's character as agriculturalist, cooperative and harmonious, and antiregulatory) is shown to be a major factor shaping and justifying the creation and operation of EPEC. Despite the existence of counternarratives, the dominant heritage narrative prefigured the emergence of EPEC and helped reinforce EPEC as the county's way of handling the growth of grape growing in the region and the resulting erosion problem. This article argues for greater attention to the role of community narratives about place in understanding how decisions are made on environmental and land-use issues.},

However, once we consider the degree of participation by classifying participants into nominal and active participants, status changes from nonparticipants to nominal participants nurture personal social capital, but status changes from nominal to active participants fail to enhance personal social capital. Our findings suggest that increasing the level of participation does not necessarily contribute to social capital development in a linear way because active participation may bring about not just positive features-such as frequent interactions with others or experiences of successful collaboration-but also conflict among community members.},

The government also seeks to promote agricultural exports and farmers' participation in processing and distributing agricultural products. Led by the Prime Minister's Office, and taking advantage of changes in the political environment of agriculture that have weakened the political power of farmers and JA, the government has launched a reform offensive with variable impact: progress has been made in some areas (e.g. JA reform) but little change in others (such as rice production adjustment).

We applied a multinomial logit model to data collected among 413 farmers in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. The results suggested that all three types of uncertainty significantly affect the business relationships chosen by vegetable farmers. In particular, it was found that as production uncertainty increases, farmers prefer contract farming and both cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction over market exchange; while as behavioral uncertainty increases, farmers are less likely to be involved in contract farming. Environmental uncertainty does not affect the likelihood that farmers choose market exchange or contract farming, while mixed results are obtained for its effects on cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction.

Many questions have arisen in recent decades in relation to the environmental impacts caused by agricultural activities. But the matter cannot be reduced to discussions, often dogmatic and sterile, opposing agriculture to the environment. To contribute to a better understanding of this problem, this study aims to examine the role of agricultural cooperatives in the dissemination of sustainable agricultural practices among its members. The data collection method involved interviews with managers of cooperatives and producer groups, direct observation on the field, and when possible and relevant, literature reviews. It is concluded that cooperatives have promoted actions to increase producers' access to more sustainable agricultural practices, but, however, they still face difficulties in disseminating these practices among its members.},

Building on Galbraith's insight that corporations cause subtle but pervasive societal imbalances, the paper locates the role of nonprofit organizations in compensating for these imbalances, thus showing corporations and nonprofit organizations to be mutually complementary rather than antagonistic actors. This argument is supported by Niklas Luhmann's vision of the precarious relationship between the complexity and sustainability of social systems as well as by Kenneth Boulding's analysis of the farmer and labor movement. Luhmann's and Boulding's perspectives show profit-seeking corporations to be social systems developing high technological complexity at the cost of sacrificing their societal sustainability, while the improvement of the latter constitutes the rationale of many nonprofit organizations. The same systems-theoretic logic suggests, however, that nonprofit organizations may tend to underestimate the technological complexity of implementing their mission-related activities, thereby undermining their own effectiveness.

Using data from 11 expert interviews and a quantitative survey involving 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya, a propensity score matching estimation is employed to assess membership effects. We show that membership in POs positively and significantly influences smallholders' adoption of food safety measures related to milk storage and the milking area. We highlight the importance of social incentives in improving food safety adoption among farmers even when price incentives are absent. Our recommendation is that PO policies that alleviate barriers to food safety adoption among farmers will be helpful in scaling up adoption.},

Consequently, as ownership is dispersed and control is delegated, members may face increasing agency cost. In spite of the potential to impact performance and even survival, empirical attention to agency problems in farm producer organizations is limited. The purpose of this paper is to address the gap in the literature with an empirical study. Design/methodology/approach With survey responses from 365 farm producer organizations in the USA, the author uses a two-limit tobit model to estimate the relationships of six ownership and governance characteristics (i.e. board size, management size, director independence, manager independence, CEO independence and non-member ownership) to agency cost, which is proxied by the operating expense ratio. Findings While controlling for heterogeneity in scale and technology, the author finds positive relationships of board size, management size and CEO independence to agency cost. The novel result illustrates there is a significant cost to the adoption of non-traditional ownership and governance characteristics by farm producer organizations. Originality/value Agency cost is rarely studied in relation to farm producer organizations. Recent contributions in the empirical literature lacked an explicit connection of ownership and governance characteristics to agency cost.},

Approximately 100 such value-added ventures formed during a period called 'cooperative fever', but public and producer interest dissipated in the 2000s. With secondary data collected from print media publications, we conclude that many of the original NGCs exited by means of bankruptcy or liquidation because of challenges common to most business organizations. However, other failures and conversions of large, successful NGCs also indicate an inherent equity and liquidity constraint, suggesting a limited ability of the organizational form to drive complex and capital-intensive value-added ventures.

A variety of diverse studies on the Almeria agricultural and credit cooperative sector and the exploration of social-economic and eco-social indicators, in addition to economic-market indicators are presented. Each correspond to a cooperative logic that spans theoretical perspectives from the dominant economic-market model, new institutionalism, and an eco-social approach, echoing theories on collective coordination governance, and the avoidance of the tragedy of the commons. The latter is of particular importance given environmental challenges and scarce resources for agricultural activity. The cooperatives in Almeria have increasingly relied on collective collaboration and coordination in order to meet social-economic and social-ecological challenges, transforming their role from that founded on a market dominant logic to that of cooperation as a coordination mechanism based on the mutual benefit of the community and environment. In turn, their ability to meet a wide range of needs and challenges of members and the community leads to their longevity. Cooperatives are able to act as both a market and non-market coordination mechanism, balancing the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, such that neither market nor non-market logics are dominant or exclusive.},

Highest price was received by farmer members of co-operative society during the corresponding year as compared by APMC and pre-harvest contractor.

However, these ventures were much less well supported than their proponents had hoped. This was not only because the War strained government financesfunding for kenzhiqu was always limited relative to support for agricultural cooperativesbut also partly because kenzhiqu attempts to recruit settlers clashed with the acute labour shortage in core zones of unoccupied China, which led to the abandonment of already cultivated land there, and partly because of the mistrust between central and regional governments. Nonetheless, wartime advocacy for more land cultivation in the Northwest did have important repercussions, leading to a renewed interest in penal colonies.},

    abstract = {In a domestic market, a duopoly produces a homogeneous final good, pollution, pollution abatement, and R&D, which reduces abatement cost. One of the firms (foreign) has superior technology. The government regulates the duopoly by levying a pollution tax to maximize domestic welfare. We consider the potential implementation of three innovation agreements: cooperative research joint venture (RJV), non-cooperative RJV, and licensing. In the cooperative (non-cooperative) RJV, the firms (do not) internalize R&D spillovers. We show that, for the domestic firm, the cooperative RJV dominates, and licensing is the least desirable alternative. Although licensing is dominant for the foreign firm, it is not implementable. Both RJVs are implementable. Implementation of both types of RJVs improves the competitiveness of the domestic firm and welfare. This study yields an important policy prescription: a subsidy policy that induces the foreign firm to accept a feasible cooperative RJV when it strictly prefers a feasible non-cooperative RJV is always welfare improving.},

    abstract = {All over the globe, cooperatives are plagued by pervasive member heterogeneity problems that are induced by the radical and dynamic changes in the business environment. Most current solutions to these problems emphasize strengthening member loyalty and commitment. Yet, many of these solutions are symptomatic rather than fundamental. Searching for fundamental solutions, this paper draws on the Luhmannian system-environment paradigm. Bringing this paradigm to bear on the cooperative scholarship, the paper views cooperatives as operationally closed systems maintaining a precarious relationship to their outer environment, which includes cooperative members. In view of their operational closure, cooperatives tend to overstrain the carrying capacity of their environment by being active in the areas marked by a limited extent of the true commonness of member interests. This overstraining results in a host of problems associated with member heterogeneity. The fundamental solutions following from the system-environment paradigm require the adjustment of cooperative boundaries and goals in light of the evolving range of the true common interests of members. In terms of methodology, we review the extant literature, synthesize the main elements of the system-environment approach and conduct a meta-analysis of case studies and other empirical research to highlight our theoretical arguments.},

The results of monitored heavy metals (Cd, Co, Ni) prove that the content of cadmium and nickel is the main polluting factor of soil in this region. The increased contents of these elements in soil produce a high risk of the uptake to plants. This further affects the technological quality along with the quality of hygiene of farmed products and finally the food itself as well.

Only very few farmers could attend some insurance programs, attend cooperatives or sign contracts to mitigate risk. Because there is a huge population of low-income, resource-poor subsistence farmers, and the investment for agricultural infrastructures is far away from sufficiency and many farmers' livelihood could not be insured, the capacity of farmers' resisting agricultural risks in China is very poor. So governments should strengthen agricultural risk management. Governments should establish special agencies responsible for agricultural risk management and enact relative acts to insure agribusiness and agricultural insurance programs profitable, and take different risk management approaches according to the status of local economy, and encourage and support farmers set up agricultural cooperatives, and intensify financial support for agricultural development.},

This paper aims to explore the determinants of pig farmers' safe production behaviour, giving special focus from the perspective of cooperatives' services. This study adopted cross sectional survey data from 27 pig cooperatives and their 540 farmers in China to test the influence of cooperatives' services on farmers' safe production behaviour. The hypotheses were tested using a logit regression model. The findings indicated that although the number of services is not a key determinant of farmers' safe production behaviour, service quality matters. When a cooperative is strongly capable of involving more farmers in certain services, and provides certain services in more frequency, member farmers behave more safely. The results also show that veterinarian and pig-selling services play an important role in ensuring farmers' safe production behaviour. For this study, the quality of cooperatives' services is implied to have a positive impact on farmers' safe production behaviour. Leaders/managers of cooperatives must try to improve the quality of their services instead of merely attempting to provide a large number of services. For government officials and policy makers, designing policies that encourage cooperatives to improve their service quality is important. This research contributes to the scant literature on how cooperative services could help farmers engage in safer production behaviour, which would improve the safety of pork products in the future.},

Different combinations of belief systems, limits, diagnostic control, and interactive control were observed depending on whether the cooperative adopted defender or prospector strategic behaviors. Control of the cooperative's strategy is achieved by combining the MCSs, since their strength lies in their joint use and their complementarity. Practical & social implications of research - The combined use of rigid and flexible controls allows agro-industrial cooperatives to simultaneously target operational efficiency and the pursuit of innovation. Originality/value - By demonstrating that not all MCSs are individually relevant to different strategic behaviors, with evidence ofequifinality in MCS combinations, the study provides an original contribution.},

We argue that GIs encourage producer quality because they attenuate free-riding problems, provide incentives to invest and facilitate knowledge sharing. Focusing on the Spanish wine industry, the results reveal that except for wineries with the lowest GI category (i.e., protected geographical indication), GI wineries show higher quality than non-GI wineries. We also observe that more stringent categories increase quality but at a decreasing rate. Regarding the influence of organizational features, we found that collective action problems seem to be relevant. First, above a certain threshold, the number of producers affiliated with a GI decreases the wine producer's average quality (i.e., it shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with quality). Second, GIs covering very large geographic areas are found to be less effective. [EconLit Citations: L15, Q12, Q18].},

Semi-structured interviews with a cross section of key stakeholders and thematic content analysis are used to identify key factors. Leadership, information sharing, trust, market forecasting, risk sharing, accountability, and provision of agronomic and other support to growers are identified as key factors that distinguish this cooper-ative hybrid model from more standard business models. Achieving both horizontal and vertical integration maximises resource utilisation and returns to growers, as well as reducing market uncertainty and maximizing product consistency. However, there are also higher costs involved with hybrid models, particularly the focus on communication and engagement required to maintain the trust of growers. These costs increase with the size and complexity of the cooperative, which creates a tension because size and scale are often required to generate the efficiencies and market power necessary to deliver benefits.},

Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used to collect data on the level of women's participation in household decision making and their involvement at different levels along the vaccine value chain (VVC) for the NCD and RVF. Data were collected from 55 chicken and goat farmers-36 of which were women-as well as representatives of chicken farmer cooperatives, sector veterinarians, agrovet shop owners, and personnel from local NGOs working on livestock production and improvement. Our results reveal that women's ability to use livestock vaccines is constrained by cultural norms that limit their decisions over productive assets and income that they can use for buying vaccines. Women are also hindered by unavailability of livestock vaccines, lack of information and knowledge about livestock vaccination, and limited access to veterinary extension services. Our results highlight a need to organize gender training targeting men and women to change the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that affect women's ability to make independent decisions regarding the purchase and use of vaccines.

Yet, its success rate is particularly dependent on the managerial capacities of urban gardeners to coordinate and organize collective actions for the successful exploitation of the gardens. The calls from governments to organize cooperative structures among farmers seem justified and merits a high priority on agricultural policy agendas. Although principles of cooperative structures exist, there is no blueprint available that indicates how to start a gardeners' cooperation. Moreover, these collaborations need to ally with and build on existing social structures of the urban gardeners involved. Our research can contribute to this alignment process by exploring and comparing international standards of prevailing organizations and their functioning among 261 gardeners in two cities in Benin. We found that a vast majority of urban gardeners are members of a cooperation. Nevertheless, their membership is largely titular because gardeners mostly behave semi-autonomously and few decisions are taken collectively. The obvious economic advantages of leveraging bargaining power, reducing transaction costs, and increasing possibilities for loans are seriously underutilized. We suggest that capacity building can help to develop cooperation among urban gardeners to reach their full potential which, congruently, should also improve the livelihoods of the urban poor.},

In comparing organic and conventional vegetables chains, we have identified five types of POs and we have investigated their distinct organizational characteristics. We found, first, that POs in the organic value chain are responding to market incentives, whereas POs in the conventional value chain are responding to public incentives. Second, contrary to POs with a focus on social and political activities, POs with economic activities are small, they have a product focus, they require member investment, and they have a high formalization status. Third, POs with output-driven objectives have higher levels of horizontal and vertical coordination than POs with value-driven objectives.

In this article, we propose a method that can operate on nominal and numeric attributes to obtain fuzzy classification rules by combining a competitive neural network with an optimization technique based on variable population particle swarms. The fitness function that controls swarm movement uses a voting criterion that weights, in a fuzzy manner, numeric attribute participation. The efficiency and efficacy of this method are strongly conditioned by how membership functions to each of the fuzzy sets are established. In previous works, this was done by partitioning the range of each numeric attribute at equal-length intervals, centering a triangular function with appropriate overlap in each of them. In this case, an improvement to the fuzzy set generation process is proposed using the Fuzzy C-Means methods. The results obtained were compared to those yielded by the previous version using 11 databases from the UCI repository and three databases from the Ecuadorian financial system one from a credit and savings cooperative and two from banks that grant productive and non-productive credits as well as microcredits. The results obtained were satisfactory. At the end of the article, our conclusions are discussed and future research lines are suggested.},

Results revealed that cooperatives and FCs have similar control and benefit attributes and different ownership and governance attributes. These FCs accepted external investments while the cooperatives accepted products from non-members. The FCs were more specialised in the specific type of rice grain sold to regional and specific markets. Both types of collective organisations had received substantial governmental financial support, however cooperatives were also strongly influenced by external governmental departments and exempted from tax.},

In agrarian practice, insufficient attention is paid to the legal form of agricultural performance, so our economic analysis focused on this area of research. The aim of the paper was to evaluate the effect of financial support in the form of subsidies resulting from the EU's common agricultural policy and to verify its connection with the performance of agricultural enterprises in terms of the legal form in the context of sustainable development of the agricultural sector in Slovakia. No statistically significant linear correlation was found between farms' performance results and the volume of subsidies per hectare of agricultural land for each legal form throughout the reporting period. In each analyzed year, business companies achieved a better overall assessment than agricultural cooperatives based on monitored parameters.},

    abstract = {Parties to the Paris Agreement can engage in voluntary cooperation and use internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards their national climate pledges. Doing so promises to lower the cost of achieving agreed climate objectives, which allows countries to increase their mitigation efforts with given resources. Lower costs do not automatically translate into greater climate ambition, however: Transfers that involve questionable mitigation outcomes can effectively increase overall emissions, affirming the need for a sound regulatory framework. As Parties negotiate guidance on the implementation of cooperative approaches under the Paris Agreement, they must consider governance options to secure environmental integrity and address the question of overall climate ambition. But country views are far apart on central questions. Of all the issues under negotiation to operationalize the Paris Agreement, cooperative approaches are the only agenda item still under debate. Drawing on an analytical framework that incorporates economic theory, deliberative jurisprudence, practical case studies, and treaty interpretation, this Article maps central positions of actors in the negotiations and evaluates relevant options included in recent textual proposals. It concludes with a set of recommendations on how operational guidance can balance necessary safeguards for climate ambition with flexibility to contain transaction costs and allow for greater participation.},

The richness of this case is neither reviewed in geographies of Guyana nor incorporated in leading theories of indigenous territoriality. The government's ambitious agenda of resource development included agricultural cooperatives, a new regional structure of governance, a villagization scheme, a hydropower project, and growth in small-scale mining. Archival research and interviews in two Amerindian villages draw out these projects in specific places to demonstrate how a collective government agenda of racial and resource consolidation redefined or re-placed a diverse indigenous landscape. The legacy of diffuse village-state relations is compromising cultural and territorial integrity as distinct peoples under transitions to neoliberalism in the postsocialist era. Whereas most literature expects essentializations ascribed to clearly defined territories, debates over land rights and resource development in Guyana indicate overlapping spatial and temporal territorializations redefining territory, identity, and space on multiple scales. This complexity is described in terms of liminal indigeneity to reflect the dynamic nature of the movement and to suggest pathways for further research.},

The opportunity to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the sector offered by new technologies comes together with its potential to face new economic and environmental challenges. This research aims to analyze the level of digitalization of the European agri-food cooperative sector from the construction of a composite synthetic index. Such an index is to be based on a diverse set of variables related to electronic commerce and the services offered through the internet. It also evaluates how European cooperatives influence the degree of technological adoption depending on their size or the wealth of the country where they carry out their activity. The empirical analytical method is thus used, through the analysis of frequencies and correlations. The results obtained reveal the existence of a suboptimal and heterogeneous degree of digitization of European agri-food cooperatives, clearly conditioned by their size and the wealth of the country where they operate. In this situation, it is recommended to promote public policies that guarantee high-performance digital connectivity, an improvement in training in digital skills and the promotion of cooperative integration processes.},

The exit behavior meant establishing a marketing or processing operation in parallel to cooperative deliveries or the planning such an action. Scale development to measure cooperative attributes resulted in six latent variables: A need to restructure the farm business, the membership role in the cooperative, opportunity, fear of negative evaluation, self-efficacy, and cooperative (dis)loyalty. The latent variables identified were tested against behavioral intentions in two logistic regressions where the dairy farmers' plans for remaining or exiting the cooperative and their plans for postfarm gate entrepreneurial activities were the dependent variables. Two latent variables emerged as significant predictors: restructuring the farm business and the membership role. These predictors were push factors in the model, suggesting that dissatisfaction with delivery to existing dairy cooperatives, rather than job or life satisfaction from setting up their own business, acted as farmers' motive to exit. These results can be used in developing communication and strategies for more viable dairy cooperatives and in understanding the incentives behind the ongoing restructuring of the dairy market from a supply perspective.

Collective organizations are becoming increasingly important; however, these organizations are rare in the settlements. Based on this finding, this study identifies the factors that influence collective action in rural settlements in the Brazilian Midwest. For that, 1162 questionnaires were completed in 54 settlements in the states of the region, and 55 presidents of collective organizations were interviewed. Organizations were classified as commercial, political and mixed, depending on their activities. Most organizations invest mainly in short-term investments for which it is difficult to exclude beneficiaries. Sanctions are rare, and when they are possible, they are rarely applied. This is a problem in commercial organizations, where it is an obstacle for the effective participation of members. In political organizations, membership is not a problem, but the lack of leadership should be addressed. Mixed organizations are not a solution, since the characteristics of political and commercial organizations are antagonistic. The creation of two distinct organizations is preferable.},

The empirical results show that (1) farmers' participation in cooperatives can improve their net income level; (2) the education level of farmers has a significant effect on their participation in cooperatives; (3) household factors, production and management characteristics and external environment also have an important effect on farmers' participation. Based on the above conclusions, this research proposes the encouragement of farmers to actively participate in cooperatives, improve their education level, vigorously improve rural infrastructure and enhance farmers' self-development efficiency to promote the continuous increase of farmers' incomes, and give rise to the positive role of cooperatives in rural development, in order to realize the revitalization and sustainable development of rural areas.},

However, although, in reality, many cooperatives indeed perform poorly, and some are apparently able to completely avoid or at least reduce the problems that are considered prototypical for this hybrid organizational form. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics required to reduce the problems resulting from poorly specified property rights and information asymmetries and, hence, to successfully compete in the market. The data we use to identify the characteristics that separate good and bad cooperatives encompass 136 organizations in Austria, Germany, and northern Italy. Our logistic regression estimations show that older and larger cooperatives (in terms of acreage) have a significantly higher probability to be listed in at least one of two highly respected wine guides. Moreover, German cooperatives have a significantly lower probability of being listed than either Austrian or northern Italian cooperatives. The findings suggest that differences in performance can be explained by the management of cooperatives.},

In the diagnosis carried out, it was found, through surveys and interviews, documentary analysis and observation of the areas, that there was a lack of knowledge on the subject, which leaves it exposed to any eventuality, especially because of its exposure to natural and biological risks. With the implementation of the methodology, a better identification and evaluation of risks was obtained, mainly in the prevention and control of tobacco cultivation and other various crops. In economic terms, losses and their valuation are minimized or reduced in the event of their materialization or occurrence. It can be affirmed that the application of this methodology contributed positively to the development of the Agricultural Cooperative, both from the economic point of view, by reducing risks, and from the social point of view, by protecting the interests of the associates and the community.},

Our empirical exercise is based on annual samples of nearly 6000 credit unions, including nearly 300 merger participants, during the 1988-1995 period.

To enhance the sheep productivity, 16 Bonga sheep breed improvement cooperatives were established in Kaffa zone of southern Ethiopia. Even though the cooperatives bring success in terms of breed improvement and income generation, there's no empirical evidence of this. Thus, this study was intended to identify factors affecting cooperative membership and estimate its impact on farmers' income. To do this, data from 320 sampled households were collected by using multistage sampling techniques. For analysis, the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model was employed. The result of ESR estimation shows that the probability of farmers' membership decision is decided by the number of sheep owned, extension contact, and proximity to a cooperative office. The model results further confirm that members get significantly better (34%) than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better (56%) than members if they had joined cooperatives. This suggests sheep breeding cooperatives are effective in improving the income of sheep producers. Thus, efforts need to be made to tackle factors that are impeding households' cooperative participation. Further, strengthening of the existing cooperatives and establishment of additional cooperatives is suggested.},

Multistage sampling and in-person interviews were used to collect information from 334 nonmember and 327 member cooperative farmers from two prominent goat production districts in Nepal. We use translog production function to calculate the technical efficiency. The endogeneity associated with cooperative membership is addressed through an instrumental variable approach. The one-step analysis was used to avoid bias due to the one-sided stochastic frontier analysis error. All conventional inputs have significant and positive impact on performance. Cooperative membership shows positive and significant impact on technical efficiency. The average technical efficiency score of cooperative members was 93.2%, while of nonmembers was 90.7%, and the difference was significant. Variables positively affecting technical efficiency include number of family members in agriculture, education, and training on goat production.

The study supports the use of the logit model to develop the system because it gives more accuracy in predicting the probability of default and debtor classification than the artificial neural network model. The working process of the system is classified into two sections including credit risk management, which is the process of screening the loan applications and setting the credit approval or rejection criteria, and affordability risk management, which is the process of determining the maximum loan amount for the debtor who has passed the credit approval criteria. In this study, the author caps the debt service ratio as a threshold for determining the amount of credit (the loan amount approved and interest expense) at 70% and determines that the maximum loan principal is 63% of the debtor's total annual income. The system is also used as an instrument to support the implementation of appropriate credit policies in handling agricultural households' excess debt and promote the building of financial discipline for agricultural households in the rural sector of Thailand.},

In periods, when the members' satisfaction is higher, we notice increasing of the number of cooperatives and vice versa. In each period the relation between members' satisfaction, cooperative values and principles and existing and operating governance structures differs seriously. We identified three historical periods for this development: pre socialism, socialism and post socialism. This paper is concentrated on the measuring the members satisfaction and to show the potential of using the new technologies (digitalization) for increasing the members satisfaction. For this purpose, we will try to evaluate the influence and application of the governance structure and cooperative values and principles on members' satisfaction. It our research we argue that the members' satisfaction is higher when the governance structure of the cooperative fits with the cooperative values and principles. For this fit we stand that the digitalization can contribute to the recovery of members involvement and transparency. The methodology of the research comprises qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative method includes in depth interviews, observations and narrative analysis. We use Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as instrument for quantitative valuation of governance structures according to the cooperative values and principles as a criterion and will use it to measure member satisfaction in each historical period.},

Design/methodology/approach - Analysis based on secondary data sources and interviews with people involved when the dominant meat co-operative in Sweden underwent major changes. Findings - The decline in the Swedish meat industry is interpreted using the theory of institutional change presented by Aoki (2007, 2011). The country's former national agricultural policy created a specific set of norms and values. Co-operatives were considered to be indispensable. The co-operative sector was large and hierarchically organised. Therefore, external signals did not create sufficient endogenous processes within the co-operatives. Co-operative adaptation to rising competitive pressure took place only reluctantly and belatedly. Hence many farmer-members defected and the major co-operative faced finally insurmountable problems. A strong ideological conviction caused the once dominant co-operative to collapse and much of the Swedish meat industry to disappear. Originality/value - This study shows that strong ideology (here a conviction about the advantages of politically governed co-operatives) can hamper endogenous processes within an organisation. Management may ignore outside influences, to the extent that even a large industry is impaired. Other large, hierarchically structured and top-governed organisations with a strong ideology may behave in a similar way.},

Originality/value This paper provides empirical support for suggestions about the factors that influence member loyalty within CMEs and the relative importance of non-financial motivations. It also provides a strong foundation upon which directors and executive managers of CMEs can build more effective member marketing and communications strategies.},

    abstract = {Chinese agriculture is experiencing a transition from smallholder farming to the emergence of commercial farms that are characterized by intensification and specialization in production, as well as commercialization and cooperation in management. It requires substantial capital to facilitate such a transition, but it is very difficult for farmers in China to access bank credit. One way that commercial farms have to overcome such handicap is by organizing themselves into cooperatives. To assess the effect of cooperatives on the credit accessibility of commercial farms, we have developed a theoretical model as well as an empirical study of commercial farms in Jiangsu Province based on data from a survey of 754 commercial farm owners. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method that control endogeneity problem are used in the analysis. The empirical results show that cooperatives have a significant positive impact on the credit access of commercial farms. Commercial farms participating in cooperatives may alleviated their credit constraints by about 17.3 percentage points and increase the average credit per capita by nearly 80,000 Yuan. Cooperatives improve the credit access of commercial farms by exerting strong market power and reputation effect based on its organizational advantages. A disaggregated analysis also reveals that small commercial farms tend to benefit more from cooperatives in improving credit access than large commercial farms.},

Of 52 samples that contained pesticide residues, carbendazim was detected in 27 (51.9%) in the concentration range of 0.02-0.04 mg kg(-1), hexythiazox in 22 (42.3%) in the concentration range of 0.02-0.05 mg kg-1, imazalil in 8 (15.0%) in the concentration range of 0.02-1.2 mg kg(-1), imidacloprid in 5 (9.6%) in a concentration range of 0.02-0.07 mg kg(-1) methidathion in 17 (32.6%) in the concentration range of 0.06-1.3 mg kg(-1), and methiocarb in 1 (2%) at a concentration of 0.02 mg kg(-1). Bitertanol, pyriproxyfen, thiabendazole and trichlorfon were not detected in any sample. Although 19 samples contained residues of two or three of the studied pesticides, no sample exceeded the European Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). The results show that despite a high occurrence of pesticide residues in oranges and tangerines from Valencian Community, the contamination levels of these residues could not be considered a serious public health problem according to European Union (EU) regulations.

It also helps to select and determine factors influencing farmers' perception and adaptation to uptake organic vegetable farming and to investigate if this in turn supports sustainable development of farmers' livelihood in the study zone. A total of 108 organic farmers of Chiang Mai Organic Agriculture Cooperative were randomly selected from three districts based on current farming practices experience, in transforming to organic vegetable farming in 2013. Information was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussion from January to April 2013. Adaptation of organic farming and farm practice's were analyzed using the three point rating scale method. In order to fulfill the objectives mentioned above, descriptive was used. The findings revealed that a number of farmers in three study areas had previous experience in organic vegetable production, organic vegetable farming practice, i.e., land preparation, vegetable seed, types of crop, planting method, soil nutrient management, pest management, weed management and harvesting. The disadvantages or constraints in small-farmer adoption of organic agriculture include: debt and income, bio-physical and knowledge constraints. The multiple regression analysis results indicated that age, education level, household labor, farm income and extension visit significantly contributed to farmers' perception on organic vegetable production. Moreover, education level, experience, natural water and farmers' networks or membership significantly contributed to farmers' adaptation on organic vegetable production.

A large sample (n = 856) of CME members and IOF customers was drawn from an online consumer panel, with broadly equal numbers in each, who completed a questionnaire examining their CE, CL, and propensity for WOM. A path model, estimated by PLS, was used to examine the relationships between four dimensions of CE (engagement attention, co-development, enthusiasm, and interaction). Although the study did not find significant differences between CME members and IOF customers in terms of the influence CE had on CL and WOM, it did find CME members had higher CE scores across all dimensions. With engagement enthusiasm (EE) as the most influential factor, followed by engagement attention (EA). The study provides empirical evidence of the influence CE has on both CL and WOM, as well as the propensity of CME members to have higher levels of CE. This offers robust support to the importance of mutuality within CME businesses. The study provides further evidence of the importance of CE in fostering CL and WOM, as well as the relative importance of EE enthusiasm and EA in this. For managers of CMEs the study shows the strength of mutuality in fostering member CE. For IOF managers, it suggests that CE does matter, and it should be monitored.},

At this end, it focuses on two research questions: What financial dynamics the Italian cooperatives have involved before, during and after the 2008 crisis, that is, in the decade 2004/2013? Are there statistically differences between business sectors and geographic area? Design/methodology/approach - Secondary data on AIDA database have been used. The financial structure is assessed using two ratios: the financial leverage ratio and quick ratio. The final sample consists of 1,446 cooperatives. The trend and exploratory analysis, analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test have been used. Findings - The financial structure of cooperatives has not been substantially affected by the crisis in any geographic area and business sector, by virtue of resilience of their business model. Moreover, these two factors produce statistically significant differences in the financial structure of cooperatives. Research limitations/implications - The study takes into account only the cooperatives that survived the crisis, so, presumably, the strongest. Moreover, another and more ratios should be considered at the end to have a more complete view on the financial dynamics. Originality/value - The literature on resilience of cooperatives is still not very rich. Moreover, this work analyses and integrates aspects and approaches that are not usually considered together.},

Interesting results were received after making statistical analysis and relevant conclusions were made. Specifically, research finds that there are material and labor resources and sustainable climatic conditions for the continuous supply of herbs on the EU market in the Imereti Agrozone. In addition, the creation of green and greenhouse industries requires interested population to provide targeted state support for credit availability, quality seed materials and pest control and irrigation infrastructure.

We access ten online databases and various working paper series and focus on summarising evidence from quantitative studies that use rigorous evaluation methods. Together, this yields 158 studies. We then retain 66 studies that contain a credible counterfactual. We visualize the interventions and outcomes in an Evidence Gap Map, highlighting both the available evidence and remaining knowledge gaps. Most studies suggest that strengthening local institutions can improve the delivery and targeting of public services and overall satisfaction with local governance. There are however, clear limitations and knowledge gaps highlighting priorities for future work. Few studies assess impacts on final outcomes such as household income or agricultural productivity and no studies assess inclusive and green outcomes jointly. We discuss the key benefits of a structured literature search and Evidence Gap Map for policy-makers and development practitioners and illustrate how it serves as a knowledge repository and identifies where evidence is lacking, thus setting the agenda for future work.},

Farmers have been exposed to multiple stressors including climate change, and they have managed to adapt to those risks. The adaptation actions undertaken by farmers and their decision making are, however, only poorly understood. By studying adaptation practices undertaken by apple farmers in three regions: Nagano and Kazuno in Japan and Elgin in South Africa, we categorize the adaptation actions into two types: farmer initiated bottom-up adaptation and institution led top-down adaptation. We found that the driver which differentiates the type of adaptation likely adopted was strongly related to the farmers' characteristics, particularly their dependence on the institutions, e.g. the farmers' cooperative, in selling their products. The farmers who rely on the farmers' cooperative for their sales are likely to adopt the institution-led adaptation, whereas the farmers who have established their own sales channels tend to start innovative actions by bottom-up. We further argue that even though the two types have contrasting features, the combinations of the both types of adaptations could lead to more successful adaptation particularly in agriculture. This study also emphasizes that more farm-level studies for various crops and regions are warranted to provide substantial feedbacks to adaptation policy.},

Workshop participants were divided into smaller multidisciplinary groups and given the opportunity to interact with representatives from eight actor positions in the value chain of the agrifood cooperative Terrena located in Western France. The four stages of the workshop were: (1) key actor interviews, (2) sharing proposed solutions for overcoming barriers, and (3) developing possible interdisciplinary concepts. Expressions of frustration were recorded serving both as a motivation for group members to become more aware of the scientific concerns and practices of their colleagues, as well as a recognition that some researchers have better skills integrating qualitative approaches than others. Nevertheless, the workshop format was an effective way to gain a common understanding of the pertinent issues that need to be addressed to meet overall multiactor-approach objectives. Working with the actor networks was identified and emphasized as a means to overcome existing barriers between academia and practice in order to coproduce a shared vision of the benefits of species mixture benefits.

Additionally, we examine changes in individuals' WTP before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated total economic value of the policy is KZT 1335 bn for the length of the program at KZT 267 bn per year, which is approximately half the total program budget, which includes other interventions beyond the creation of production co-operatives. The total economic value of the policy would equal the cost of the whole program after 10 years, indicating public support for this policy amongst Kazakh citizens. Psychological factors, i.e., attitude, perceived social pressure, and perceived behavioural control, and the respondents' awareness of the policy and views on the Soviet Union regime are associated with their WTP. Sociodemographic factors, namely, age, income, and education, are also statistically significant. Finally, the effect of the shocks of COVID-19 is negatively associated with the respondents' WTP.},

The paper presents the data of a project which is the collaboration of a Swiss and a Romanian team in a three-year programme (SCOPES programme of Swiss National Science Foundation), in which a survey was carried out with the help of questionnaires. This was applied in a sample of 612 rural households in four municipalities. The main questions focused on land use and land inheritance as well as agriculture. The sample included two generations: the parents and their children (362), men and women. The research team looked for an answer to the question: who are the next generation farmers in Romania and are there cultural and ethnic and also gender-based differences between rural families? As the data show there are four different strategies applied in the four regions. In one, traditional sustainable agriculture was preserved, combined with a high rate of international migration. In another village there is a good perspective for farming, but a lot of young people are going to other sectors of activities. In the third location the former socialist cooperative was transformed into a new type of agricultural cooperative. This region has the best developmental perspectives. In the fourth region agricultural activity is maintained and the local economy also includes other types of activities which are,complementary to agriculture (trade, industry and other services).},

In the present work, the effect of thermal processing on phytochemical profiles, antioxidant capacity, and volatile compounds of fig wines was investigated. The results show that varieties of detected volatiles and the content of anthocyanins in fig wines decreased significantly owing to fig drying, while individual phenolic concentration increased. The drying process exhibited no significant effect on the contents of total polyphenols and flavonoids, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and oxygen radical-scavenging capacities, whereas prefermentation heating showed a negative effect on the antioxidant capacity and phenolic compositions, and resulted in a significant decrease of the contents of acetaldehyde and acetoin. Overall, fig drying showed a stronger effect on the flavor profile of fig wines compared with prefermentation heating. Choosing an appropriate thermal processing procedure is essential to preserve the antioxidant capacity and flavor of fig wines. Practical applications Figs are sodium-, fat-, and cholesterol- free, while they are rich in fibers and antioxidants compounds. Our previous study indicates that figs are excellent raw materials for winemaking attributing to their high sugar and polyphenol contents. At present, there is a lack of studies on systematical investigation of the manufacture and the quality control of fig wines. The phytochemical compounds, antioxidant capacity, and volatiles in fig wines as well as the effect of thermal processing during prefermentation were investigated in this study. We expect our study will provide guidance for producing innovative and high quality products in the wine industry.

    abstract = {There is no doubt that in today's world establishment of cooperatives is an effective way of attracting people's involvement at macro level. The agricultural sector is so extensive that achievement of national goals and high levels of development is practically unattainable without active participation by farmers. Provision of a combination of agricultural functional requirements by cooperatives would lead to enhancement of the standard of living of their members. Rural production cooperatives, also known as agricultural cooperatives, are defined as a modern construct with their own specific organization and management. Cooperatives incorporate their own ruling principles, structures, networks, rules, regulations, and bylaws. These features provide concrete benefits in the process of agricultural development. This paper aims to review the activities of rural agricultural production cooperatives in Iran and propose a strategic planning approach for development and institutionalization of their operations. This qualitative research was conducted in Iran using case study and purposeful sampling method. The proposed strategies for promotion of production cooperatives include: provision of support in terms of financial credits, organizational and management expertise, technical know-how and technology, equipment and training, empowerment of members aimed at transforming them into successful farm managers, promotion of team work among members, and extraction of appropriate information and practical advice from research data provided by contemporary investigations. In conclusion, it is proposed that establishment of cooperatives alongside other issues should be considered by policy makers and local leaders and representatives trusted by farmers be involved in their implementation.},

Despite promises of increased efficiency, it is not clear whether this paradigm shift will change how we decide when our self-interest (e.g., comfort) is pitted against the collective interest (e.g., environment). Here we show that acting through machines changes the way people solve these social dilemmas and we present experimental evidence showing that participants program their autonomous vehicles to act more cooperatively than if they were driving themselves. We show that this happens because programming causes selfish shortterm rewards to become less salient, leading to considerations of broader societal goals. We also show that the programmed behavior is influenced by past experience. Finally, we report evidence that the effect generalizes beyond the domain of autonomous vehicles. We discuss implications for designing autonomous machines that contribute to a more cooperative society.},

    abstract = {The article explores the histories of oil palm in Nicaragua during the 20th century within a drastically changing Political Economy. In Nicaragua, palm oil cultivation dates back to the 1950s, when the United Fruit Company started to plant oil palm on the Atlantic Coast. In the 1980s, due to the agrarian reform of the Sandinista revolution, political conditions and economic strategies changed completely. In this era, a socialist government started to create agricultural cooperatives for oil palm. After the defeat of the revolution, during the neoliberal era of the 1990s, palm oil cultivation expanded in different surges. This expansion was tied to funding from international organizations, especially during the conjuncture of the bioenergy framework, which implied a new narrative of sustainability from the global level. The extent of the territory on which oil palm is cultivated more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2010, and again more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, although the Sandinista government was back in power and not particularly supportive of oil palm. The article argues that although the drivers, the main actors, their specific arguments, funding sources, and policies promoting oil palm have varied over time, the narrative of 'already degraded land' has consistently been used. Social contestations from below point not only to environmental and social consequences, but to the funding schemes and narratives of international institutions sponsoring and promoting oil palm.},

    abstract = {This document describes two case studies of cooperative experiences in Spain. The two cases are significantly different in terms of production, volume and scale, however they have evolved in a similar way. Specifically, each of the cooperatives began when a small group of producers organized to collectively obtain inputs. Since then, through a series of stages, they have reached the point of collective transformation and commercialization of a great diversity of products. The first case is the Sobrarbe Agricultural Limited Cooperative (Sociedad Cooperativa Limitada Agropecuaria del Sobrarbe-SCLAS), created in 1983, with its headquarters in Ainsa, the Sobrarbe county seat, in the province of Huesca in the Autonomous Community of Aragon. Sobrarbe County, with a population density below three inhabitants per square kilometer, is one of the areas in Spain that has most intensely suffered a depopulation process since the middle of the 20(th), century. SCLAS has a strong connection with the territory where it operates and is focused on maintaining and promoting agricultural life in Sobrarbe County and the Pyrenean mountains in general. Since its origins as a bakery established to supply bread to the most remote mountainous areas, the cooperative has been expanding to include a range of different facets and activities, such as: (i) supplying fertilizers and seeds; (ii) purchasing and storing harvested crops (cereals, oleaginous seeds, hay); (iii) a cooperative store for food, veterinarian pharmacy, plant health, livestock material, hardware and miscellaneous (work clothing, shoes, etc.); (iv) compound and mineral feed manufacturing; (v) veterinarian service, feed advice, and fiscal and financial advice; (vi) completing paperwork for the CAP and agro-environmental assistance; (vii) plans for new facilities; (viii) technical reports; and (ix) commercial technical management. The endless list of the cooperative's activities provides livestock producers and farmers with a framework for meeting their needs. This would otherwise be difficult, given the disadvantages in a challenging rural setting (poor roads and highways, depopulation, lack of services, etc.). The range of activities carried out by the cooperative was recognized with an Award for Diversification granted at the 1995 Conference of the Spanish Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives (Federacion Espanola de Cooperativas Agrarias). One example of the cooperative's diversification can be seen in its veterinarian services, which provide clinical attention to various animal species, as well as animal feed services, plans for livestock facilities, R&D activities with research institutions, quality controls, a veterinarian pharmacy, management of genealogical books, and the promotion of new production efforts. SCLAS also fulfills an important role by assisting producer groups that have been organized in the county to address natural resource management and the sustainability of agro-livestock activities. Some examples are the Sierra y Canones de Guara Livestock Farmers Association (Asociacion de Ganaderos de la Sierra y Canones de Guara), the Association of Pyrenees Inhabitants (Asociacion de Habitantes del Pirineo), and the Huesca Extensive Meat Producers Community (Comunidad de Productores de Carne Extensiva de Huesca). The second case study is on the Pedroches Valley Agro-Livestock Cooperative (Cooperativa Agroganadera del Valle de los Pedroches-COVAP), located in the southwestern part of the Iberian peninsula. It operates in a territory consisting of 15,000 square kilometers, with a population of 250,000 inhabitants who work primarily in the areas of agricultural and livestock farming. Significant economic activity has been developed during recent years around the agro-food industry and related services. The average altitude in the area is 650 meters above sea level, with low rainfall at 350mm/m(2), and an extreme continental climate. The land is not particularly apt for cereal cultivation or pastureland. The entire territory is dominated by the oak-meadow ecosystem, which is characteristic of the southwest part of the peninsula, with the holm oak (Quercus ilex) as the dominant arboreal species. In this territory COVAP has developed a unique agro-food model that integrates the entire production chain, including animal feed, genetics, breeding centers, a slaughterhouse, a milk industry and the commercialization of all products. The number of dairy cattle has increased to 30,000, distributed in 450 operations; the number of beef cattle integrated into the enterprise is 20,000 and the number of sheep, 180,000. Ninety percent of milk production is distributed in the domestic market, and ten percent in the European Union and other countries. Seventy percent of meat production is distributed in the domestic market and thirty percent in the European Union. Previously, dairy farming was practically non-existent in the area, however at the end of the 1970s, dairy cattle breeding was initiated, and numerous operations were established, with 2-3 cattle per farmer. With COVAP's support to farmers and efforts in commercialization, this area has become one of the most important centers of dairy production in Spain, with an annual production of 220,000 metric tons.},

Although there is an extensive body of literature on comparisons of food safety control practices across different governance structures, these studies have been conducted mainly in terms of qualitative and descriptive analysis. In addition, little attention has been given to family farms. This study addresses the food safety control practices adopted by firms with different governance structures in China. Food safety control is expressed by the following aspects, i.e., pollution-free, green, organic, and/or geographical indication products certification, establishment of production records, and pesticide residue testing. Three types of governance structures that engage in agricultural production are distinguished: farmer cooperatives, agricultural companies, and family farms. The food safety control practices of various governance structures are investigated based on a database that comprises 600 vegetable and fruit enterprises in Zhejiang, China. The results show that (1) pesticide residue testing is adopted by the most firms, followed by products certification, and production records are adopted by the fewest firms, and (2) agricultural companies adopt more food safety control practices than family farms, while farmer cooperatives adopt the fewest food safety control practices. Governance structure features of a cooperative in terms of ownership, decision-making, and income distribution are the main reasons for the low level of food safety control in the cooperative.},

To evaluate the influence of nitrogen-rich fertilizers on quality characteristics of celery, shelf life tests of celery grown with 2 levels of nitrogen and 2 different nitrogen fertilizers were performed. The treatments of the celery samples were identified as follows: T1, mineral nitrogen (80 kg ha-1); T2, mineral nitrogen (120 kg ha-1); T3, organic nitrogen (80 kg ha-1); T4, organic nitrogen (120 kg ha-1); R4, residual organic nitrogen (120 kg ha-1); and C, untreated control. Celery plants were selected and packaged in either of the following 2 plastic films: antifog polyolefin (AFP) film or microperforated polypropylene (MPP) film. The nitrate contents, weight loss, hardness, changes in color parameters, and total phenols were studied for both packaging types during storage. The results demonstrated that celery fertilized with organic nitrogen and packaged in AFP film reached a shelf life of 37 d. The control sample packaged in MPP film was not marketable after 20 d, but the same untreated sample packaged in AFP film reached a shelf life of 30 d. Practical Application We consider the opportunity to apply a new packaging solution that could increase the shelf life of the product having highest interest on the markets. The positive effect of the organic nitrogen fertilization supply together with the packaging solutions a possible increasing in shelf life, reducing almost completely weight loss, and guaranteeing better hygiene and conservation. The organic nitrogen fertilization and the packaging solution could achieve the best result for the environment and for the economic management of agricultural cooperative.},

This trust is shaped by homophily and the tendency of individuals to prefer interactions with similar individuals. Using mortgage loan data from a cross-section of credit unions in the United States from 185,446 applications, I find that credit unions where the majority of board members are minorities are less likely to reject a similarly qualified minority applicant than their counterparts. Governance by minority directors significantly reduces the effects of discrimination faced by minority applicants. The board's effect is strongest in minority neighborhoods and where the homophily is stronger between directors and applicants.},

The attractive theoretical properties of membership markets are examined, along with some factors that may account for their rarity in practice. These practical difficulties help explain the rarity of labor-managed firms themselves, along with various facts about their design, behavior, and distribution across industries.},

Their intention and behavior related to implementation of vegetable traceability systems directly determine the success or failure of the implementation of those systems. The objective of this study was to identify factors that affect participation behavior in vegetable traceability systems by using a structural equation model and a logistic regression model. Data collected from a 2019 in-person interview survey of vegetable farmers located in Jiangxi province, China were analyzed. Results from the structural equation model showed that perceived usefulness positively affected farmers' participation intentions and their participation intentions positively affected their participation behavior. The impacts of social influence on perceived usefulness were greater than the impacts of traceability system characteristics on perceived usefulness. Facilitating conditions such as equipment resources, knowledge, and skills that farmers have a significant positive impact on the perceived ease of use. Facilitating conditions and perceived usefulness were two key factors influencing participation intention. Results from the logistic regression model showed that gender, age, marital status, cooperative organization membership, and whether the respondents were near a city had a significant impact on participation intention. The conclusions of this study further expanded the current research scope regarding farmers' quality and safety behaviors and revealed the internal decision-making mechanism for farmers' participation behavior regarding vegetable traceability systems. This study has implications for implementing vegetable traceability systems to ensure food safety in China or elsewhere in the world.},

Given recent trends in urban migration and increased opportunities for off-farm work, aging farmers increasingly face problems with farmland succession and usage in China. This study investigates the usage of farmland in the absence of a farm successor. Using multinomial logit regression model and data from rural households, we find that aging farmers without successors tend to have options for farmland usage. Specifically, the presence of a grain subsidy increases the likelihood of keeping the farmland in agriculture-albeit by hiring labor or leasing out farmland and decreases the likelihood of pooling farmland into farming cooperatives as shareholders. Off-farm work decreases the likelihood of using hired labor and leasing out farmland. Rich rural households are less likely to keep farmland idle. Large farm operators are more likely to lease out farmland. Finally, rural people with pension plans are more likely to pool their land in land cooperatives - a less-risky option.},

    abstract = {In Europe, cooperatives have a long tradition and are widespread in the agricultural sector. Cooperatives in the wine sector of some EU countries even surpass a market share of more than 50%. In Germany, the first wine cooperative was established in 1868 in the Ahr region. Despite the decline in the number of cooperatives, of members and of the vineyard area cultivated by cooperatives, wine cooperatives are still accountable for roughly a quarter of the German vineyard area. Due to developments in the field of sustainability and digitalisation, cooperatives are facing increasing pressure. Based on the definition of cooperatives by the International Co-operative Alliance, one can conclude that cooperatives are a sustainable form of enterprise. A previous study from 2019 showed that sustainability and digitalisation were not mentioned by cooperative management as important topics in the competitive analysis. Also, sustainable management practices have not been analysed explicitly for wine cooperatives so far. We therefore consider sustainability and digitalisation in the context of the strategic management of wine cooperatives. Our article does not aim to show further development in the areas of sustainability and digitalisation but rather to unveil existing managerial practices in order to provide a basis for management decisions. As only limited knowledge exists, a qualitative approach was chosen. Interviews were conducted with the management of wine cooperatives (n = 13) and representatives of the regional and national cooperative associations, which in turn represent the wine cooperatives as a whole (n = 4). A data content analysis was performed. The results describe state of the art of sustainable management practices and digitalisation in wine cooperatives. Even if the understanding of sustainability and digitalisation is quite similar among the respondents, the operationalisation in the cooperatives differs strongly. However, it is clear that innovation, adaptability and sustainability are strongly interlinked. Options for future research and the limitations of the study are provided as well.},

The current research indicates the different activities developed by this cooperative as part of a sustainable model aimed to permeate in rural communities all over the northeastern Sierra of Puebla. Today the cooperative is integrated by 290 communities from 22 municipalities in the northeastern Sierra of Puebla, whose members are mainly from Nahuatl and Totonaca origin aiming at a sustainable development for their families, communities and the region. The model promoted by the Cooperative is based on the premises of democracy, fair economic participation, self-reliance, autonomy, compromise, gender equality and cooperation, aiming to provide a healthy diet, profitable businesses while employing the community members, stressing the importance of improving their skills on the individual and the collective level. Revaluation, rescue and preservation of their culture are some of the ultimate goals, working within a sustainable framework. This research emphasizes some activities implemented by the cooperative as good examples of sustainable strategies to achieve development in rural areas. A few instances are: The creation of an eco-friendly hotel featuring 15 rooms and 14 cabins where different eco techniques are applied, such as the usage of bamboo for building and a rainwater collector system, among others. Organic pepper and coffee production and trade, as well as the region's endemic honey. An educational project comprising English teaching, computer literacy and training on management, sociopolitical affairs, ethnicity, and environmentally related issues concerning the region inhabitants. The creation of a women's association aiming to work together to gain their livelihood, implementing activities such as sightseeing, handcrafts, clothes confection, among others.

However, the income growth rate of farmers is relatively low, and the income gap between urban and rural areas is widening. Using a sample of 1,325 large-scale farming households in Lin'an, this study constructs a theoretical path for how the level of vertical integration and an organization model affect farmers' income levels and empirically tests the path using a mediation effect analysis model. The results indicate that organization models and vertical integration are important factors that affect farmers' income levels. The total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who participate in agricultural operation organizations are greater than that of farmers who do not participate in an operation organization. In addition, the total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who produce and process and those who produce, process, and sell are higher than those of farmers who only produce. A farmers' organization model has both a direct and an indirect positive influence on their income level, with the indirect positive influence coming through the mediating variable of vertical integration. The application of the organizational model can promote the growth of rural households' total family income and agricultural income by 13.48% and 14.48% respectively, consisting of direct increases of 9.67% and 10.19%, and indirect increases of 3.81% and 4.29% through vertical integration. The results also show that access to credit, agricultural technology training, and the farmer's education level have significant positive impacts on farming income levels. The findings suggest ways to increase farmers' income by perfecting agricultural management organization systems, promoting agricultural industrialization, strengthening rural financial support, improving agricultural technical training for farmers, and increasing their level of education.},

Eastern Germany has a special advantage in producing bioenergy crops: the former agricultural cooperatives built up quite large farms with, compared to Western Germany, comparatively large fields. Therefore, a modelling study of the potential and the impacts of aspen SRC plantations in the five eastern federal states of Germany under the recent climate and future climate projections was conducted. The ecophysiological forest growth model 4C was used to simulate the growth of aspen SRC plantations and their impacts on carbon in soils, and groundwater recharge, on selected suitable areas currently under crops but with marginal site conditions for cropping. A clear signal to enhanced growth condition over the whole area can be seen in the simulation of the mean annual woody biomass yield under conditions of climate change, which increased from 7.47 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate to 9.26 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) at the end of the considered future period 2034-2055 under climate change. The mean soil carbon sequestration rate was 0.81 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate and could rise up to 0.93 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the assumption of climate change. On the other hand, the mean annual percolation rate, used as an indicator of impacts on the regional water budget, will diminish under future climatic conditions. The results suggest that aspen SRC plantations are a suitable contribution to regional CO2 mitigation and carbon sequestration under possible change of climate, but that negative impacts on the regional water budget are possible.},

The results show that, rural households' land utilization mode affects heavy metal content in soil, e.g., the degree of heavy metal pollution of soil for intensive planting is higher than that of traditional planting, viz. vegetable greenhouse > garlic land > traditional crop farmland. The management of cultivated land with due scale is beneficial to reducing heavy metal content in soil, that is, the land fragmentation degree is in direct proportion to heavy metal content in soil, so rural households are encouraged to carry out land circulation and combine the patch into a large one. Excess application of fertilizer, pesticide and organic fertilizer will lead to heavy metal pollution of soil, while agricultural technical training organized by government department and the foundation of agricultural cooperative can promote the technical level and degree of organization of rural households and enable them to be more scientific and rational in agrochemicals selection and application, hence reducing or avoiding heavy metal pollution of soil. Single factor pollution level of heavy metal in the soil for planting various crops is different, so it is recommended to prepare various pollution reduction programs for different land types and pollution levels for the harmony and unity of human-nature system.},

    abstract = {The objective of this paper was to develop a framework model for sustainable supply chain risk for dairy industry based on knowledge base. It presented a conceptual framework with integrated risk supply chain and knowledge base systems. The critical point of dairy located on the product which has the characteristic easy damage. Risk-damaged dairy contaminated with bacteria due to improper handling of dairy. Risk occurred in each activity in the supply chain network ranging from farmer, cooperative and dairy processing industry. The structured approach of supply chain risk divided into the phases of risk identification, risk measurement and risk assessment, risk evaluation and risk mitigation and contingency plans; and risk control and monitoring system based on knowledge base system. Adding Knowledge base component to risk supply chain will produce the following process: knowledge base risk capture, knowledge base risk discovery, knowledge base risk examination, knowledge base risk sharing, knowledge base risk evaluation and knowledge base risk repository. The relationship between risk factor, risks and their consequences are represented on Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FNMA) and Hierarchical Risk Breakdown Structure (HRBS). Likelihood of risk event occurring, the level of dependence between risks and severity of risk event are quantified using linguistic variables and fuzzy logic. The proposed system was designed by Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS). The design of this model was able to improve the effectiveness of decision making with regard to the organization of knowledge, storage and sharing of knowledge in the agro-industry supply chain risks dairy.},

Producers seeking broader marketing opportunities often turn to co-ops. This study examines how, within alternative food networks (AFNs), co-ops play a role in the emergence of the Domestic Fair Trade (DFT) movement in the USA. The DFT movement is based on the idea that family farms and small-to mid-sized farms in the global north are facing many of the same pressures as producers in the global south. The Domestic Fair Trade Association (DFTA) in the USA is the umbrella organization for a variety of stakeholders. The DFTA seeks to 'support family-scale farming, to reinforce farmer-led initiatives such as farmer co-operatives, and to bring these groups together with mission-based traders, retailers and concerned consumers to contribute to the movement for sustainable agriculture in North America'(1). This study assessed five co-ops (through interviews and document analysis) to determine their experiences with integrating DFT into their business practices. The research reveals that DFT concepts are important to co-operative decision-makers, but they are faced with challenges when it comes to actually integrating DFT into their business model. Insight into stakeholder perceptions and professional-level DFT activities, indicates that co-ops will be a key factor in determining whether the DFT movement will succeed in the USA.},

Nonetheless, efficient farm practices can enhance productivity, farmers' profit, and the price and quality of marketed rice. This study analyzed the profitability and efficiency of rice production in the Ayeyarwaddy Region of Myanmar and identified the influencing socioeconomic characteristics and farm-specific characteristics. Primary data from 130 randomly sampled farmers in the Ayeyarwaddy Region were collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and Tobit regression analysis. According to the average overall technical efficiency, farmers have an additional rice yield potential of 25 percent that can be attained by improving input utilization. The best practices benchmarked in the region showed that technical inefficiency is caused by excessive use of inputs, especially herbicides and animal power. Most rice farms in this study suffer from allocative and economic inefficiencies resulting from wrong combinations of input usages. The average economic efficiency level indicates that farmers can increase their profitability by 57 percent if they adapted to reduce input costs. Moreover, efficiency was significantly higher for farmers who were younger, better educated, more experienced, had access to agricultural extension services, and cultivated the Aye Yar Min variety. Efficiency can be improved by setting up farmers' cooperatives to increase the scale of operations. Moreover, the government should intervene to reduce input prices, control the quality of input seeds, and install an appropriate financial crop insurance mechanism. Effective and systematic agricultural extension services should be widespread to improve the efficiency and decision-making skills of rice farmers in the study area.},

The increased popularity of entrepreneurship education toward the end of the twentieth century in many European welfare states is usually associated with a shift toward neoliberal, market-oriented, policies. It is argued here that an important reason for young entrepreneurship's success was its ability to connect with the Swedish tradition of cooperation and democratic decision making, in combination with values such as individualism and competition. A case in point is the surprising compatibility between progressive pedagogical ideas and neoliberal entrepreneurialism. The article is based on a study of Ung Foretagsamhet (Young Entrepreneurship, henceforth UF), the Swedish version of the American organization Junior Achievement, and the ambition of the consumer cooperative movement's think tank, Koopi, to offer a different kind of entrepreneurship education. In the analysis, the concept of the entrepreneurial self is applied to these two different programs, and the results show how they clashed, but also overlapped, in ways that help explain the success of UF. The article is a contribution to our understanding of how entrepreneurship discourse emerged and manifested itself in everyday environments in the late twentieth century, and as such also contributes to the history of Nordic neoliberalism.},

We posit that whether that package of information is evaluated by itself-in separate evaluation (SE)-or side by side with another package-in joint evaluation (JE)-matters. Across a variety of contexts, four studies show that people average in SE and add in JE. Consequently, mildly favorable information hurts evaluations in SE but helps in JE. Study 1 demonstrated this adding-and-averaging effect among persons with expertise: law professors judging law faculty candidates. Adding middle tier academic publications to a higher tier publication on a CV decreased evaluations of a candidate judged in SE but increased evaluations of the same candidate in JE. Study 3 examined a linear pattern prediction, showing that each piece of mildly favorable information linearly added to the overall impression of a package of information in JE but linearly detracted from evaluations of the identical target in SE. Finally, Study 4 traced these differences in evaluative judgments to a shift in reference points brought about by evaluation mode.

While there is a shared interest among the three basic stakeholder areas of industry, government, and education institutions, these stakeholders recognize that each area has many other interests and issues that are divergent from the interests of the other stakeholder areas. In this case the garment industry was expanding its scope of service to its customers. However, the education and training resources in the, country needed to be brought into the development program at the outset. In addition, the various government agencies responsible for economic development also had a major role to play in achieving a successful outcome. Other nations were equally concerned about their garment industries as well. This project examined what in any other countries in the region, the U.S., and European countries were doing. The resolution evolved around the three sectors setting up a cooperative organization of partners that maintained the independence of each sector while encouraging cooperation where their interests were in common. The European Union Technology Platforms were seen to be an appropriate model for Sri Lanka. A symposium of key stakeholders from the Private, Public, and Academic Sectors was convened for them to decide how they could best organize themselves as equal partners in a flexible organization structure for change and development of human resources for the garment industry.},

The authors also consider the effect of farmer participation in cooperative-like organizations known as Farm Bases (FBs). Design/methodology/approach The authors use multiple list methods and elicitation strategies to measure Chinese apple farmers' risk attitudes and time preferences. Because these farmers can either sell their apples immediately to supermarkets or intermediaries or place them in storage, the authors assess correlations between their storage decisions and their preferences regarding risk and time. The authors also differentiate risks involving gains and losses and empirically examine individual risk attitudes in different scenarios. Findings Marketing decisions are moderately associated with risk attitudes but not time preference. Farmers with memberships in local farmer cooperatives are likely to speculate more in cold storage. Thus, risk aversion behavioral and psychological motives affect farmers' decision-making of cold storage and intertemporal marketing activities. However, membership in cooperatives does not always result in improved income and welfare for farmers. Research limitations/implications The research confirms that behavioral factors may strongly drive vulnerable smallholder farmers to speculate into storage even under seasonal and uncertain marketing volatility. There is the need to think deeper about the rationale of promoting cooperatives and other agricultural forms, because imposing these without careful consideration can have negative impacts. Originality/value Do risk and time preferences affect the decision of farmers to utilize storage facilities? This question is important because it is not clear if and how risk preferences affect the tradeoff between consuming today and saving for tomorrow, especially for farmers in developing countries.},

Sitajakhala Dugdha Utpadak Samabai Samiti Limited (Sitajakhala Dairy Producers Cooperative Society Limited) is a successful cooperative society in the northeastern region of India. The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how the cooperative manages its production and supply chain of milk and milk products and highlights several issues that the cooperative encountered in the recent past and how those issues were managed. This case also illustrates how an agribusiness cooperative has been growing over the years, including expansion of business and the creation of a brand image, as well as benefiting its members and their communities. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a case study approach where they went for in-person interviews of Sitajakhala's executive members and office staff; in addition, the authors were given access to Sitajakhala's marketing and financial records as well as its annual reports and vision documents. Findings Sitajakhala Co-op provides a platform where individual dairy farmers (most of who are small farmers and many of them are illiterate) can unite to bargain for higher prices for their milk. Due to its member-oriented business strategy, Sitajakhala Co-op has been growing well with active support of its members. Consistent quality control and marked improvements in labeling, bottling and packaging of milk and milk products has helped the cooperative to establish itself as a leader in dairy products supplier in Assam among bulk buyers as well as individual consumers. Sitajakhala cooperative also provides dairy farming related services to its members for free of charge to improve milk production and quality. One of the shortcomings of the cooperative is underutilization of its modern milk processing plant which needs to be addressed by the management in earnest. Research limitations/implications This case study is based on information from one dairy cooperative in Assam, India; thus, the findings of this case may not translate into other dairy cooperatives in India or elsewhere. Nonetheless, cooperative practitioners may find the findings useful from a management perspective. Social implications Sitajakhala Co-op management was keenly aware of the non-dairy related needs of the community it serves. Some of such services include free medical ambulance service for its members, supporting secondary education through providing merit and need-based scholarships and funding physical improvements to a local high school and a local college. In addition, the cooperative regularly provides funding to local sports and cultural events and local social institutions which have positive impact on the larger community. Sitajakhala cooperative has been providing employment to the local youth in the Morigaon area and plans on continuing to do so. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case study focusing on the management and operations of a dairy cooperative in the northeastern part of India. Knowledge gained from such study is expected to benefit not only Sitajakhala cooperative but also other dairy cooperatives in a similar situation. This case study will also benefit senior undergraduate and/or graduate students specializing in agricultural economics/agribusiness and can also be used for executive training for the management of academic institutions and food companies.},

Since the 1980s, over 3000 women-only dairy cooperative societies have been founded in Karnataka, India, with the objective of economically and socially empowering women. First we review the broader literature on gender and collective action in a development context and then empirically assess empowerment levels among fifty-eight female dairy farmers in Karnataka. We discriminate between membership and non-membership status in women-only versus mixed-gender dairy cooperatives and compare empowerment levels among those groups, borrowing categories from the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. We find that, in a context of rural poverty in which women-only cooperatives are promoted without offering additional development opportunities for men, the empowering effects remain limited to increased leadership abilities. Cooperative membership as such does not automatically enhance women's control over income or their intrahousehold decision-making power. In fact, members of women-only cooperatives perceive themselves as having even less control over dairy income and productive decisions compared with unorganized female dairy producers. These findings suggest that collective organizations in the dairy sector which systematically exclude men may fail to increase women's empowerment at the household level. At the same time, women face entry barriers to participation in mixed-gender cooperatives. We conclude that policies in support of women-only cooperatives and female members in mixed-gender cooperatives may require more rigorous evaluation.},

This study integrates problems of agency between principal-principal and conceptions of cooperativism.

In order to reach the objective of the research, multivariate data analysis was used as a technique with the use of panel data from 39 cooperatives affiliated to SICREDI, from 2008 to 2014. The data indicated that the dominance index is an influential factor and statistically significant return on assets (ROA). Another relevant contribution was the identification of domination by borrowers and the absence of neutral cooperatives, which may violate the real function of credit cooperatives, their sustainability and their commitment to the guiding principles of cooperativism, thus moving away from their assumptions, culminating in practices contradictory to his discourse.},

Before making any credit decisions, credit analysis (the assessment of the financial history and financial backgrounds of the borrowers) should be completed as part of the screening process. Good borrowers with low credit risk would be granted a loan, while a high risk borrower would be denied. A good credit risk assessment assists financial institutions on loan pricing, determining the amount of credit, credit risk management, reduction of default risk and increase in debt repayment.

The data used in this study is from Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC), a major lender in Thailand agricultural sector. During the period of 2001 to 2003 a total of 16,560 agricultural loans were made available. The logistic regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to identify critical factors in lending decision process in the agricultural sector and to predict the borrower's creditworthiness (probability of a good loan). The results of the logistic regression verify the importance of total farm asset value, capital turnover ratio (efficiency), and the length of bank-borrower relationship (duration) as important factors in determining the creditworthiness of the borrowers. The results show that a higher value of farm assets implies a higher creditworthiness, which lead to a higher probability of a good loan. However, the negative signs found on both capital turnover ratio and the length of bank-borrower relationship (duration), which contradict with the hypothesized signs, suggest that the borrower with a longer relationship with the bank and a higher gross income to total assets has a higher probability to default on debt repayment. The overall prediction accuracy of the logistic lending decision models is above 85% on both in-sample and out-of-sample forecast, and is higher than the probabilistic neural network (PNN) model on out-of-sample forecast. However, the neural network models can detect Type I error (accepting a bad loan as a good loan) more accurately than the logistic models. The costs of classifying a bad loan as a good loan (Type I error) are more significant than the costs of misclassifying a good loan as a bad loan (Type II error). The overall prediction accuracy is not completely reliable since it ignores the relative cost difference between Type I and Type II errors. Thus, when the expected loss of misclassification is computed and compared, the results indicate that the misclassification cost of the PNN model is the best model with the lowest misclassification costs. In summary, the empirical results found in this study support the use of PNN model in classifying and screening agricultural loan applications in Thailand.},

Pellervo is an interest group and a service organization for over 300 Finnish cooperatives. This study is based on data collected from Pellervo delegation members with an aim to examine, how co-operative ideology is interpreted among a group that consists of key people in co-operative organizations. Data is interesting because Finland is the most co-operative country in the world and Pellervo delegation represents Finnish co-operative organizations broadly. By using qualitative text analysis method we studied how the 27 members of the delegation construct the meaning of co-operative movement and co-operative organizations. The aim was to understand how co-operative identity was interpreted and if the interpretations were collective of fragmented. Based on the analysis we conclude that the interpretations regarding co-operative identity, its central, distinctive and enduring features, were interpreted very collectively. Since the study is based on the premises of interpretative research paradigm, we believe identity at a collective level is an evolving phenomenon constructed by individual interpretations. The findings suggest that co-operative ideology should be promoted actively and with high quality in all areas of life in order to create and maintain the identity of co-operative ideology in the society.},

    abstract = {For many people in the United States, as well as the world, the State of Alaska is a symbol of nature - clean air, clean water, and a clean environment. Their image has the Aurora Borealis dancing in the winter sky; the wonderful Denali National Park surrounding the tallest mountain in North America, Mt. McKinley (20,320 feet); and, abundant wildlife in all parts of the state. All of these images symbolize the beauty of nature where man's power doesn't reach. Alaska is the largest state in the U.S. at 591,000 square miles and is larger than Texas, California and Montana combined. Alaska's environment zones include the Arctic, sub-Arctic and rainforest. Each area presents many challenges for its communities such as solid waste disposal, recycling and wastewater treatment. The greatest challenge for these three issues is in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions for Alaska's 200+ remote villages. Even transportation in remote areas comes with unique complications and considerations that are not apparent at first - such as the wide utilization of 4-wheelers and snow machines in the Arctic and sub-Arctic as well as boats in the Southeast rainforest. Seagoing barges from Seattle bring fuel oil, gasoline, food supplies, building supplies, vehicles and other necessities to coastal and Yukon River villages. Circumstances unique to Alaska with its huge landmass and different environmental zones are not experienced in the Lower 48 states or in countries such as in Japan where space is limited and recycling is critical. Part of the answer to assist remote rural communities to address all these issues involves the transfer and utilization of NEW Technology as well as the application of other Educational Technologies and Processes to assist the transfer process. Distance, costs, culture, population size, etc. are all factors that become very relevant to the success of the endeavor. Prior to 1959 - The early years - to augment face-2-face and class room/workshop sessions, there was radio, telephone, and mail as the means of communication. The dog sled in winter and bush planes were the common mode of transportation between villages. These were the limitations when we discuss information/technology dissemination methodologies. The University of Alaska with its Land Grant Status and the Cooperative Extension Service circa 1935 Matanuska-Susitna (Matsu) Colony, was one model with the intended purpose of information/technology transfer to remote rural Alaska. There were others. This presentation analyzes Alaska educational, information, communication, and demonstration technologies along with their relative successes and limitations in the educational process, both formal and informal. The focus initially will be through the experiences of the US Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension system in Alaska as it relates to technology transfer and to educational delivery. The experiences presented will include the University of Alaska which will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1917 and its statewide network of local community campuses; and, various governmental, NGO, and private sector experiences in utilizing various educational technologies (to include organizational management approaches) to connect and move forward Alaska's communities, both large and small.},

A cost efficiency model is used to understand the relationship of product offerings and business cycle response upon bank performance. Design/methodology/approach - A cost efficiency model is used to understand the relationship of product offerings and business cycle response upon bank performance. Markets comprised of alternate size and type of financial institutions are compared. Findings - Greater values of X_EFFi when institutions compete are observed in this analysis. Cost efficiency is lowest when community banks are the only institution in the market, and second lowest when credit unions are the only competing institutions. Call report data are analyzed from 1994 to 2013. The number of big banks increases community bank efficiency and efficiency of large banks. Also, the number of community banks does affect big bank cost efficiency. The magnitude of the effect pertaining to the number of community banks upon big bank efficiency is much smaller than that of the number of big banks on community bank efficiency. Originality/value - This study considers cost efficiency and profitability as measures of institution on the performance of a competing institutional type. The modeling approach uses cost efficiency as a method of observing the performance of financial institutions and an explanation of how firms persist, grow, and respond to changes in technology or regulation. The effects of the presence of each type of financial institution on the performance of another type are compared. Situations in which any number of one or more institutional types is present in a market are considered for analysis purposes.},

    abstract = {Croatia has 2.95 million hectares of farmland, of which it uses only 1.2 million hectares. The areas are exploited to produce inefficiently, and so is the system of incentives and subsidies. Therefore, Croatia is highly dependent on food imports. Although there are still one in three people living in agricultural households, only a few food products are being produced in quantities sufficient for national needs. On food imports such as the one in 2008, Croatia has spent $ 1.5 billion. Rural areas occupy about 85 percent of the territory, and 85 percent of villages are affected by depopulation. Residents of rural areas are characterized by increasing life expectancy and a fifth of the rural population aged between 25 and 40 years wants to move to the cities. In fact, almost half of agricultural land is classified in the group threatened by erosion. Nearly a third of all agricultural land suffers from acidity. More and more farmland is lost by converting agricultural land into construction land. For these reasons, the strategic goal of increasing agricultural production will not be easy to achieve. To achieve this we need to change priorities in national policy towards agriculture and rural areas. It is considered that a major obstacle in the way of raising productivity is the small area (approximately 1.9 hectares) owned by agricultural households. These households, on the other hand, have approximately 80 percent of agricultural resources. Fragmentation of agricultural land does not adopt the global economy, but emphasizes large, easier and faster cost-effective systems. Small agricultural households are facing destruction, and without them there is no life in rural areas and caring for the environment. The imperative to raise productivity in agriculture comes into conflict with the objectives of rural development and sustainable development. In order to counter such trends, the EU wants to use incentives to adjust small and medium-sized farms to market conditions. However, the distributional impact of incentives is such that large manufacturers picked the most money, rather than small and medium producers. This effect leads to land consolidation, the creation of large landowners and the development of profitable food industry. Deregulation and the promotion of competitiveness in agriculture and food industry further complicate the survival of viable rural communities. In surviving villages, the EU wants to develop the competitiveness and diversification of agricultural production in rural households (e. g. tourism and rural crafts). In this paper we explore the ambivalence of European agricultural policy and its impact on Croatian agriculture and countryside, and try to answer the question whether this policy, in the case of Croatia, will lead to the collapse of local agriculture, the disappearance of rural communities and food price increases. Based on experiences of other countries and theoretical models, the paper gives outlines of a national agricultural policy which would, for example, through the development of cooperatives and clusters protect family farms and households living in rural areas. At the same time such a policy could affect the increase in agricultural yield and income of small and medium-sized farmers.},

    abstract = {Cooperatives are expected to help generate economic growth; become competitive business entities; remain as effective self-help organizations and uphold sensitivity towards the environment. However, cooperatives like their business cousins in the public corporations have been plagued with governance issues (Shaw, 2006). This has prompted studies to isolate the probable causes of their predicament. The issue of corporate governance of cooperatives has begun to become mainstream in research and conventional wisdom dictates that governance procedures and processes that abound in the corporate world can prudently be applicable in the governance of cooperatives (Cornforth; 2004). In a cooperative the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the collective interest of the members (Jussila, Goel, & Tuominen, 2012). Board of Directors need to demonstrate adequate and effective monitoring of organizations they are helming. This paper examines how the board of directors can act as a custodian against financial fiasco in cooperatives organizations. Our study focuses on the association of size of Board of Directors of cooperatives and the frequency of board meetings with performance. Outcomes from the study indicated both the size of the board and the frequency of board meetings has no relationships with performance of cooperatives organizations in Malaysia. The results suggest that the board of directors may no longer be effective in managing the cooperatives towards achieving their members' objectives. Various literatures supported this finding. This result lends the conclusion that governance of cooperatives is in dire need of revision to increase its effectiveness and eventually rightly positioning cooperatives as a bona fide catalyst of national development as well protect the interest of the members.},

    abstract = {The paper focus on the concept of food and agriculture as an infrastructure - which is both spatial and relational -, within the context of the urban Mediterranean phenomenon, where, with all its political, cultural, economical, social and environmental differences, there is a common relationship with food and food production in an urban setting. The aim of this paper is to explore the agricultural context of Rome, focusing on its relationships with development in the metropolitan area, within the framework of sustainable food planning. Starting from the relationship between food and city, we have mapped the foodscape, identifying a number of representative conditions - typologies - in the metropolitan area of Rome. Through a of criteria - relationships with the urban fabric, production patterns, flows, services, infrastructures, environmental characters, social behaviour linked with the production - the study tries to summarise Roman agriculture. We focus on a set of recurring elements, involving both criticalities and opportunities, that bring together city and food production. Rome has what we could call a compact structure compared to the dispersed urban model and this has encouraged the development of local agricultural systems, where both flows and landscapes involve the city. While production is organised into wedge-shaped areas, the places where exchanges occur are mainly within the municipal area of Rome, with the exception of farms involved in direct sales. Despite a strong urbanization pressure caused a reduction of 42% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) between 1990 and 2000, this trend was reverted back between 2000 and 2010, with an increase of the UAA of 14%. The analysis of land use (CLC, 2006) reveals a system of wedge-shaped agricultural areas, where short supply chain models can be used efficiently to manage and promote the use of land and landscape. In synthesis, in terms of their production systems, there is a high number of short supply chain farms in Rome (over 40%), mostly with mixed production systems linked to multifunctional farming. The role played by the local food network in Rome is remarkable, particularly in case of farmers' market, SPG' and those linked to box schemes experiences have seen significant success. The increasing importance of Alternative and Local Food Networks is showed in the data: the 60% of Rome municipalities farms sell directly (Istat, 2010) it was registered an increase of + 57% Farmers' market at municipality level and of + 64% in Rome's province (2010/13) (Marino et al., 2013). The local food network behind agriculture in the city, within a number of integrated social agrarian cooperative, who represented an alternative food production system and landmark for many initiatives carried out by the civil society, associations, cooperatives, volunteer and school sectors, community supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives. This account of short supply chains in Rome is inevitably the account of an urban phenomenon. It is indeed the city that determines its special characteristics for both physical and relational aspects. The mapped farms are mostly located near the main routes that radiate from the city to the countryside, underlining the centrality of the flow of exchanges that take place with the city. The processes of transformation affecting the primary sector in urban and suburban environments reflect an agriculture that forms (and produces) new landscape and functions, typically reconnected to the historical value of agriculture in and around the Mediterranean cities. Food, because of its cultural and historical place in Mediterranean tradition, has a significant role in configuring the areas where exchanges takes place, which are, therefore, specific places for meeting and forming relationships within the public spaces of a city. The system identified by the paper configures the set of all the different forms of agriculture and food in Rome as a device of resilience for the city, made up of places where flows, relationships and processes become increasingly more sustainable, and where both physical and intangible spaces act as an infrastructure in their exchange with the city.

    abstract = {In Romania, the microfinance market is a concept at a starting point. In the general context of sustainable development, to achieve this objective, of the needs of rural microfinance, implementation of economic models that gives an impulse to align this area to the market economy principles and requirements is essential. The models must be adapted to the concrete and real needs of those who are living and working in rural areas. Being at the start of this research theme that I want to draw, I realize that such a challenge is both difficult and subject to the risk that some of the advanced ideas may not be in the accordance with the current financing policy of decision makers. Beyond these considerations, is necessary to disclose that to the level of community states, this dynamic market is still quite heterogeneous because of the institutional and legislative disparity and also because of very diversified microcredit providers. In the EU, microcredit is provided by financial institutions regulated by the Central Banks and those unregulated by the Central Bank, but covered by Community Directives, such as commercial banks, savings banks, cooperative banks and public banks. To these are added a number of non-banking institutions namely microfinance institutions, enterprises specialized in microfinance, foundations, credit unions, charities, NGOs and others. It should be underlitied that the 2014-2020 Romanian rural development strategy, in the context of the 2020 Europe, strategy is a strategy of economic growth with objectives for a smart economy, sustainable and favorable to social inclusion and the improvement of agricultural and non -agricultural SME's competitiveness from the countryside. The scientific approach that I try to define starts from the fact that the Romanian rural area, a total of 2.7 million peasant households, which together account for more than 5 million hectares or 34 percent of the agricultural area of the country is outside the current system of agricultural financing. They are added 2 million people in rural areas without any plot of land, without a job, who live in extreme poverty. Transferring these european ideas in the Romanian context and correlating it with the statistic economic situation in Romania, I believe that through the creation of economic models of microfinance and in accordance with current regulatory framework, we can contribute to the sustainable development of this considerable potential that we identified in rural Romania.},

Although water-saving technologies (WSTs) have been introduced for decades, sustained commitment to WST is not being met. This paper investigates factors affecting adoption and sustained adoption of WST based on 261 households in the North China Plain. We employ Heckman's two-stage sample selection process: (1) households decide whether to adopt WST or not and (2) households decide whether to sustainably adopt (adopt for a long time) WST or not. Particular attention is paid to the role of water scarcity in the initial adoption and sustained adoption stages. Several indicators relating to water scarcity are used to calculate a water scarcity index based on principal component analysis. The results showed that water scarcity exerts a significant and positive effect on both adoption and sustained adoption of WST. Non-adopters and non-sustained adopters face less severe water scarcity than adopters. Membership in cooperative organizations significantly improves the likelihood of sustained adoption; 63.6% of sustained adopters have a membership in cooperative organizations, compared with 18.2% of non-sustained adopters. The number of plots negatively affects the sustained adoption of WST; sustained adopters on average have 3.0 plots, and non-sustained adopters have 5.3 plots. Education, extension service, farm size, off-farm work, relatives working in the local government and irrigation costs are positively and significantly associated with adoption and sustained adoption decisions. Finally, we find that labor-saving capacity significantly influences both stages, whereas capital-saving capacity is only significant in the adoption stage. Only 10% of non-adopters consider adoption of WST as more labor- and capital-saving than conventional irrigation practices, in comparison with nearly 50% of adopters. These results imply that the extension of WST should consider focusing more on cooperative organizations and hold more demonstrations for farmers. Moreover, given that the degree of water shortage varies from region to region, the WST extension standards should vary accordingly. Governments should strengthen awareness by enhancing education and publicity concerning water scarcity and conservation.},

We consider food quality a social construct and farmer cooperatives key players in the 'quality battlefield'. Using a case study approach, we investigate the everyday practices of three farmer cooperatives. We show that farmer cooperatives are capable of establishing or joining quality food networks, but the benefits are often limited because of their weak position or instability of the network. Building strong alliances with other network actors is difficult because of cooperatives' limited communication capacity and lack of economic and social capital. Our findings suggest that policies that support farmer cooperative capacity building at the micro level could improve the performance of smallholder farmers and their cooperatives in the expanding domestic quality food market.},

In the market, there are methodologies for credit scoring, each analyzing a large number of microeconomic and/or macroeconomic variables selected mostly depending on the type of credit to be granted. Since these variables are heterogeneous, the review process carried out by credit analysts takes time. The objective of this article is to propose a solution for this problem by applying fuzzy logic to the creation of classification rules for credit granting. To achieve this, linguistic variables were used to help the analyst interpret the information available from the credit officer. The method proposed here combines the use of fuzzy logic with a neural network and a variable population optimization technique to obtain fuzzy classification rules. It was tested with three databases from financial entities in Ecuador - one credit and savings cooperative and two banks that grant various types of credits. To measure its performance, three benchmarks were used: accuracy, number of classification rules generated, and antecedent length. The results obtained indicate that the hybrid model that is proposed performs better than its previous versions due to the addition of fuzzy logic. At the end of the article, our conclusions are discussed and future research lines are suggested.},

At present, the alienation is difficult to be eliminated as specialized farmers' cooperatives are in their initial stage. This paper firstly points out three essential features of specialized farmers' cooperatives which are different from those Of generally profit-oriented enterprises, namely, serving the members as a primary goal, being controlled by all members and benefiting users first. The reason why these cooperatives exist in large numbers is the imbalance of benefits of government which represents the public interest, regulatory agencies and their staffs, social capitals, rich farmers and vulnerable smallholders. The key to restraining this kind of alienation is promoting the standardization of specialized farmers' cooperatives.},

By way of guaranteeing scale, quality of produce, and professionalism, cooperatives are assumed to be capable to subvert current trading patterns and contribute to sustainable market access for small-scale farmers. However, such change logic does not hold up well with the circumstances of African farmers and traders. We argue that for understanding how a cooperative organizes sustainable market linkages, attention should be paid to its capacity to navigate within its specific context. This article traces the emergence and development of two cooperatives in distinct contexts, Uganda and Mali. We use a critical institutionalist approach, called bricolage, to show how in both cases farmers organize sustainable market access by blending novel arrangements with existing institutions embedded in social and economic relations. We suggest agricultural policy and programmes to shift attention to the ability of a cooperative to embed new institutions in socio-historical shaped local realities rather than requiring them to comply to an ideal-type organization.},

The results show that the stock of social capital can enhance the economic performance of farmer cooperatives and that social capital has a larger impact when there is stronger formal governance with regard to income distribution. Social capital and formal governance are therefore complementary. An improvement in some aspects of formal governance is favorable to the outcome of social capital. Cooperative practitioners need to consider the creation of both social capital and formal governance.},

Co-operative Movement, in the early days after the founding of the PRC, followed the rule of centralization, which was the imposed institutional change from the top down. Household Contract Responsibility System (HCRS) has followed the rule of decentralization since 1978. And Farmers' Cooperative Organizations (FCOs), which were based on the HCRS, followed the rule of centralization. They actually realized the combination of centralization and decentralization in operation. Compared with the HCRS that was the induced institutional change from the bottom up, the FCOs Were also the induced institutional change which resulted from the combination of government's promotion and guidance with farmers' initiatives. Under the dual influences of development path dependence of the FCOs and government' standardized administration, the FSCs are booming and take the forms Smallholders' Cooperation(SC), Agriculture-related Departments' Establishment(ADE), Rural Grassroots Units' Establishment(RGUE), Leading Enterprises' Establishment(LEE), and Professional Farmers' Establishment(PFE), which adhere to the rule of interest driven. Among these patterns, the SC, which is mutual aid economic organization characterized by democratic management, is the only one that conforms to classical cooperatives' principles. Considering the domestic settings, such as urbanization, smallholders engaged in nonagricultural industries, reconstruction of government-enterprise relation, etc, and the international environment of rapid economic globalization, the right strategic options in the future are to boost the development of the LEE and the PFE, and even the cooperatives' unions and share holding cooperatives further if conditions are mature.

Promoting the stable collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain is an urgent problem. Considering the characteristic demand of consumers for agricultural products, this paper takes the supply chain mainly operating characteristic agricultural products and dominated by farmer cooperatives as the research object and constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of farmer cooperatives, manufacturers, and retailers. We study the supply chain collaboration mechanism from the main strategy choice and the specific factors affecting its strategy choice. The results show that farmer cooperatives implement a strict supervision strategy and increase the reward and punishment to promote the collaboration in the supply chain, but the increase in supervision cost is not conducive to the income of farmer cooperatives. In the case of loose supervision, the difference between the additional income and the collaboration input is higher than the free-rider income obtained when adopting a non-collaboration strategy, which is conducive to its evolution towards collaboration. In addition, increasing additional income, improving synergy coefficient, and reducing collaboration input and free-rider income will increase the probability of the system evolving to Pareto optimal, and accelerate the realization of comprehensive collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain dominated by farmer cooperatives. The research results provide a certain supplement to the related research on agricultural product supply chains in theory, and provide a reference for the comprehensive collaboration of the agricultural product supply chain dominated by farmer cooperatives in practice.},

The objective of this study was to test low-cost, easy-to-implement modifications to a locally available convection dryer, to improve its energy efficiency. Experiments were conducted in cooperation with a Hmong farmers' cooperative in Northern Thailand. Insulation of the air ducts and control of the air recirculation rate led to energy cost savings of US$2.45 per dryer-load. With the modifications required being simple, the investment needed was recovered after only approximately 20 loads, while the energy efficiency of the dryer increased from 33% to 39%.},

The literature reports that firms are increasingly entering into long-term, high dependency exchanges as a result of increased demand for quality goods, demand for variability of goods, demand for constant innovation, severe price competition and increasing technology costs. These changes are forcing firms to enter into complex relationships with other firms in order to remain competitive. Examples of such relationships are: relational contracting, network organisations, strategic alliances and horizontal co-operation. The increase in number and complexity of these exchanges in an environment characterised by uncertainty has led to the increased interest in the use of obligation contracting. Furthermore, this interest has been reinforced by the changing nature of products being exchanged. More knowledge-based products and information-based modes of production necessitate the sharing of strategically sensitive data. Hence the rise of importance of obligation contracting is not only due to the increased number of complex exchanges in uncertain environments, but also the very nature of the goods being exchanged.},

Regional cooperation to reduce disaster potential is a rather recent endeavour both internationally and in the region. Cooperation to enhance environmental security in post-Soviet Central Asia is slowly strengthening monitoring, planning, and prevention of natural disasters with a new approach that anticipates risks and hazards and seeks to reduce the likelihood of disasters instead of responding to the aftermath. Empowerment of regional associations to coordinate states' activities to understand and solve common problems is needed. The legacy of the Soviet past and the contemporary states' efforts to participate in regional cooperative organizations are reviewed and the prospects for new instruments for DRM cooperation are discussed. The needs are multifaceted and complex, but there are glimmers of promise for regional and borderland cooperation.},

We study if and how farmer cooperatives can build brand equity to drive or support product differentiation. With emphasis on ownership type and product origin, we conduct two choice experiments with cheese and cereal consumers in the United States. The results of our multinomial logit model indicate farmer cooperatives can command a price premium as compared to store brands, but not as much as non-cooperatives. Cheese and cereal consumers also indicate a general willingness to pay for product origin and family ownership attributes, but the effects are not always compatible with farmer cooperatives. Overall, although price premiums for cooperative brands and labels may exist across various product categories, the heterogeneity in willingness to pay estimates for other product attributes is suggestive of the difficulties farmer cooperatives face in pursuit of product differentiation.

This research analyses the strategic management of CSR in the 28 electric cooperatives that market electricity in Spain with the aim of determining their level of commitment to CSR and stakeholder participation in their corporate policies. The analysis is based on the descriptive-exploratory study of the whole population of electric cooperatives. The results indicate that the CSR management of most electric cooperatives is still in an emerging stage within the Value Curve. Importantly, there is a significant percentage of cooperatives that have already advanced towards the consolidating and institutionalized stages. However, most of these social-economy organizations are not developing programs that link their CSR strategies with their priority SDGs and sustainability as a commitment to their community.},

Creation of recommendations for praxis towards successful cooperation is an important step in the following analysis. The coexistence of cooperation and competitiveness is a common solution that will support the creation of added value (synergy effects) of the cooperative relationship of several environmental elements. This research confirms the versatility of synergy within different conditions and environments, achieving it as a result of being managed. Mapping the synergy in a current environment within the chosen cooperation relations shows that each one contributor of such a relationship builds stronger relation if all cooperation's actors build stronger competitiveness.

There was a positive relationship between member satisfaction with the cooperatives and farmers' assessment of the cooperatives' environmental actions, although the cooperatives' economic and social contributions were even more appreciated. Consequently, at least under the prevailing circumstances, member satisfaction with their cooperatives is positively associated with the farmers' view of the environmental ambitions of their cooperatives.},

This article examines the cooperative sphere to draw out how affect and relationships in cooperatives may radically alter the sense of working democratically. It draws on methods of social dreaming and free association to examine cooperative development in three cases at different developmental stages: in Hamilton, Bermuda; Preston, UK; and Mondragon, Basque Country. It examines evidence of the way relationships and affect may emerge in organisational systems that place a focus on participatory democracy as opposed to hierarchical structures. We draw from intensive work in these cases to consider the distinctive background and contextual features that may be present within cooperative development processes. This article concludes that cooperative working can foster developmental relationships and present distinctive expressions of the affective realm over time.},

Namely, the findings show that: a) values have ordering properties, since they foster identification and collective action when invoked by managers in day-to-day work; and b) values have disordering properties (generating tensions, resistance and discursive struggles) when these position people to speak on their behalf.},

His desire and ability to communicate with every level involved in the implementation of the CCP as well as his considerable autonomy from the governor enabled him to create, articulate, and implement the strategies necessary to change the equilibrium.

Design/methodology/approach Provincial-level panel data from 2007 to 2017 are used for this study. A linear dynamic panel regression model is estimated using multiple estimation methods, i.e. the generalized method of moments (GMMs), fixed-effect model and ordinary least squares (OLS) are applied. Findings The empirical analyses indicate that the role of the government is important for the development of farmer cooperatives but limited in some specific aspects. First, the coverage of financial support is positively associated with the growth of cooperative population and membership size, but the strength of financial support, measured by the total amount of financial support divided by local agricultural gross domestic product (GDP), has no statistically significant effects on the development of cooperatives. Second, financial support does not exhibit significant influence on the revenue of cooperatives. Third, the magnitude of the effect of government support on cooperative development is heterogeneous across different sectors. Originality/value The research study adds to the institutional economics literature on the association between institutional environment and organization development by focusing on a particular and an important type of organization, i.e. farmer cooperatives.

The many state organizations that were previously involved in providing water management services in the drinking water, hydropower and irrigation sectors have been consolidated into autonomous and accountable private, public or cooperative organizations, supported by an improving legal framework and an emerging regulatory capacity. This process has already led to improvements in operational performance. To activate overall water resources management, the Water Resources Management Agency (WRMA) and its five River Basin Management Organizations (BMOs) were recently established under the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP), which has a broad natural resources mandate. In this paper, it is argued that the current single biggest challenge of the MNP is to revitalize water resources monitoring, water use permitting and enforcement, which will be essential for future basin planning and management. This will require that the MNP streamline cooperation among its various monitoring and enforcement agencies and the WRMA/BMOs. At the same time, financial mechanisms need to be designed to finance these basic water resources management needs, so that they are sustainable. These priority measures are now being developed in the first National Water Program (NWP).},

    abstract = {Both global and domestic markets place increasing importance on the quality and safety of food products that are produced in China. The presence of microbial agents, toxic animal and plant products and chemical contamination remain because of the existence of small and dispersed farmers, who are not educated to use agricultural inputs correctly. This inability raises the issue of safety control in the agricultural sector. This study proposes that cooperatives' self-inspection of agricultural products before they enter the market can better organize small farmers to utilize a standardized production and safety management system. Therefore, we attempt to explore the factors that influence farmer cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. An Ordered Logistic Regression Model is employed to estimate the factors that influence cooperatives' choices of inspection frequency. The results show that the respondents expressed a medium to high level of implementing self-inspection but a lower level of concern in testing products by batch. The regression results indicate that subjective norms from the social environment, the perceived behavioral control of managers, ability and rules including input management, production documentation, and social demographic variables, significantly affect cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. The future implementation of safety inspection depends on the extent to which subjective norms, ability, and internal rules can improve agri-product safety in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The principal-agent relationship of Chinese farmer cooperatives has its own characteristics. By constructing theoretical models of agent incentives which suit for Chinese farmer cooperatives, and based on it, this paper analyzes those related factors, and discovers that the degree of effort made by the core members is inversely proportional to their rents obtained; the incentive for core members' effort has positive correlation with the proportion of their own agricultural products to the total; the higher proportion that the core members shares is, the larger the incentive for them is, the higher the degree of their effort is, and the higher output and surplus to be distributed are. So it is of crucial role that explicitly motivating and implicitly motivating the core members, raising the proportion of ordinary members in leadership structure, increasing internal information transparency to effectively curb the opportunism behavior of the core members and ease the principal-agent problem of the farmer cooperatives.},

These include institutional pluralism, institutional logics, competing rationalities and pluralistic contexts. The French pragmatic sociologists Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thevenot have contributed to this line of research with a sophisticated theoretical framework of orders of worth, which has been applied in an increasing number of empirical studies. This article explores how the order of worth framework has been applied to empirical studies of organizations. First, I summarize the basic ideas of the framework, stressing the aspects of special relevance for studies of organizations. Second, I review the empirical studies focusing on the coexistence of competing orders of worth in organizations showing that the order of worth framework primarily has been related to three main themes in organizational research: non-profit and co-operative organizations, inter-organizational co-operation, and organizational change. Third, I discuss how the pragmatic, process-oriented aspect of the research program, focusing on the intertwining of values and action in various forms of 'justification work', has been translated into empirical studies. I argue that even if highly interesting empirical studies have begun to appear on the pragmatic aspects of the order of worth program, empirical studies of 'justification work' may be a potentially very promising focus for future empirical studies.},

Second, until court decisions made in 2011-2014, the reach of the Capper-Volstead Act and the legality of pay-for-delay conduct in the drug industry were in doubt.

The cooperative purchases this seed from members at N$ 2 kg(-1), cleans it, and sells it at N$ 3 kg(-1). Distribution to farmers is currently done by the government extension service, but the cooperative is negotiating with private firms to take over marketing.

While many analyses have blamed the 'tragedy of the commons' and government mismanagement for environmental destruction, this paper provides a case study of resin tapping in Honduras which formulates the hypotheses that common property regimes can be successful and that economic liberalization policies may be detrimental to community-level resource schemes. Over half of the 6000 farmer-resin tappers in Honduras are organized into forty-six co-operatives that market the tree sap, wood and other forest products. These activities combine the twin goals of community-based forest preservation and income generation. Established legally in 1974, the tapping groups have expanded to include a variety of organizational and technical arrangements. The two co-operatives of Villa Santa and San Juan de Ojojona demonstrate contrasting histories, ecological endowments and economic outcomes. Currently the Honduran resin tappers are facing problems over their access to forest resources, the fluctuating profitability of extractive activities and the stability of the co-operative organization. These three issues are relevant to a variety of community-based environmental activities, and the lessons of the Honduran experience can be applied to analyse the processes of environmental degradation and community response elsewhere in the Third World.},

The article draws experiences from the rapidly emerging FC field in China. Three cases are selected to cross check findings from them and innovation journey analysis is used within each case to understand FCs' engagement in innovation processes. The findings show that FCs cover a wide range of knowledge intermediation and innovation intermediation functions identified by the literature. FCs recognize the importance to connect technical, social and economic dimensions of farming practice and provide corresponding services to link farmers to relevant actors, like extension agencies, research institutes and supermarkets. Though they mainly work through bilateral relationships as opposed to acting as a systemic intermediary, they could take the role of coordinator in the service system and bridge the gap between the research and policy system and everyday farming practice, especially in the absence of a systemic coordinator. However, their legitimacy as intermediary might be challenged due to the potential conflicts with governments, market actors or their members, and their local position may provide insufficient clout for developing durable relationships with relevant actors.

The different approaches are due to the multiple perspectives suggested by a phenomenon multi-faceted in itself and that can be observed starting from different premises and purposes. Starting from these considerations, it seemed us appropriate to analyse the cooperative forms of enterprise focussing on the economic aspects of the production of goods and services, carried out in enterprises in which the management is entrusted to bodies different from those allocating the financial capital. Taking this into account, the first part of this work will focus on the definition of the cooperative forms of enterprise in general economic theory and in business theory. On the basis of the theoretical-conceptual profiles of reference, this study proposes an interpretation of the cooperative enterprise representing a reference model of the economic production that can at the same time increase both the economic development and the wealth of a whole community. With specific regard to this latter aspect, the second part of this work will focus on two cooperatives from Puglia, structured as community-based cooperatives, which tend to associate the pursuit of economic goals with the social and economic development of the local communities in which they operate. Through the illustration of two case studies (the community-based cooperatives Melpignano and Jemma) this paper aims to highlight the potential of community-based cooperatives for the support and the economic and social development of local area and its residents.},

The perception is now commonly held that it is necessary to radically rethink the entire set up of the institutional school towards a more flexible, adaptable and co-operative organization (Irgens and Jensen in Skolen som kunnskapsorganisasjon. Utdanning, nr.3,1. februar, 2008). This paper explores an empirical case, where a school is implementing a device called 'flexible timetables' in an attempt to depart from former fixed structures and private teaching practices. By combining process thought and liminality theory, the paper offers a theoretical framework for understanding some of the dynamics and unintended consequences of this transformation process. In so doing the paper calls attention to some important limits to the vision of flexibility and openness that informs this program of organisational change and subjectivity. Flexible timetables are conceptualized as a liminal affective technology (Stenner and Moreno-Gabriel in Subjectivity 6(3):229-253, https://doi.org/10.1057/sub.2013.9, 2013), designed to disrupt structures supporting former institutional practices, and to engender circumstances that are describable in terms of liminal experience. We use the concept of liminal affectivity to describe the collective atmosphere of ambivalence and volatility that is summoned through the intervention. We also draw attention to certain unexpected side effects, as when the participants experience themselves both paralysed by the ensuing paradoxes, and captured in dynamics of polarisation (Greco and Stenner in Theory Psychol 27(2):147-166, https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354317 693120, 2017). The paper proposes the concept liminal affective leadership wherein the use of the technology is framed as a continuously sensitive balancing of the volatile liminal affectivity that it induces.},

Therefore, an exploratory study has been undertaken to provide empirical insight into Bangladeshi coastal shrimp farmers' risk perceptions and risk management responses. Data from our study show that 95% of farmers have no formal training in shrimp aquaculture. Shrimp farmers' cooperative societies operate in only 13.3% of the studied areas and only 15% of shrimp farmers are involved with these cooperative societies. The results reveal that shrimp diseases, price and availability of quality shrimp seeds, exploitation by intermediaries and uncertainty about the future demand for shrimp in foreign markets are perceived as the most important sources of risk. On the other hand, prevention of disease, timely supply of shrimp seeds, elimination of middlemen from the supply chain and farm management training are considered among the best methods to manage the risks in the shrimp-farming business. We also observe some disparities in farmers' perceptions. For instance, farmers mentioned that removal of influence of middlemen from supply chain is essential for the betterment of their business. However, they did not consider market monitoring, direct contract with processors and improved marketing facilities as important risk management strategies, although these factors play a significant role in reducing the influence of intermediaries and private money lenders.},

    abstract = {The Mondragon Cooperative Experience has been one of the worker-owned alternative organizations that has received the most attention in the academic world. Despite its economic success, this experience has also been wrought with its own share of tensions and internal paradoxes. Surprisingly, the perspective of worker-member-owners in the analysis of those inconsistencies in Mondragon has been given very little prominence. Similarly, the equivalence between the formal policies defined in that experience and the day-to-day activity has been widely taken for granted in the literature. This article aims to fill this gap and contribute to the literature by analyzing the extent to which Mondragon's basic cooperative principles are applied in the daily practice from the perspective of worker-member-owners. To that end, in-depth interviews were conducted with worker-member-owners of Mondragon outside their working environment. An interpretative analysis provides evidence of a decoupling of cooperative principles from the workers' daily activity. Furthermore, a tacit and non-formal principle frequently surfaces in the interviews: the principle of the primacy of secure membership and guaranteed employment. This seems to be the most solid tie that binds members to their organization, in a context with growing individualization and precarious employment conditions, together with a ubiquitous managerial discourse that encourages shallow forms of workplace participation. This work contributes to the broader field of organizational theory and sheds light on the dissociation process in formal policies of organizations governed by alternative founding principles. It also tries to contribute to the study of the sustainability of such alternative organizations.},

The central member position is due to the cooperative being an organization of, by, and for members. Furthermore, the presence of a central position is due to members having a function as owners and users of cooperative service. Member education, as one of the cooperative principles, is necessary because the members' knowledge of the cooperative will support the role or central position of the members. Efforts to implement member education, among others, are implemented by means of best practice development. Best practice (dictionary.com) is a procedure or set of procedures that is preferred or considered as a standard within an organization, industry, etc. Best practice development is based on organizational management experience. This research was conducted on Multipurpose Cooperative Makmur Sejati Malang. Analysis of information from key informants is done by triangulation analysis. The findings of the research indicate that the analysis of best practices is in line with the stages of development of cooperative organizations as part of member education. Best practice, in establishing Rukun Ibu for example, gives awareness to members to avoid lending activities. In addition, best practice at development stage is emphasized on member education. The fact that the fulfillment of obligations is executed by the 12th, as well as the loan service starting on the 13th of each month, instills an understanding of the need to balance the fulfillment of obligations and the utilization of rights as members of the cooperative.},

In the face of increasingly fierce regional competition, it is an urgent need to seek new ways of developing agriculture for the zone. According to the actual situation of agriculture development in the construction process of the zone, the necessity and current situation of the development of farmer cooperatives were described by investigation and practice. And then, some problems were found out in the development of cooperatives. Finally, the countermeasures for promoting development of the cooperatives in the zone were proposed, such as publishing more support policies, enhancing the service level of cooperatives, and paying attention to training farmers' entrepreneurship and management knowledge. The hope is to provide useful lessons for the development of cooperatives under the background of construction of Central Plains Economic Zone.},

Lean Six Sigma is one of the best techniques which has been used for more than two decades to make quality products by reducing defects. The current scenario for the development puts more effort towards sustainability, and hence stakeholders and consumers are all demanding for sustainable products. Nowadays, an integrated approach of sustainability and Lean Six Sigma has started to gain attention from researchers, which includes the financial, environmental, and societal factors of the organisation. The present study is a case study-based implementation of a hybrid framework of Sustainable Lean Six Sigma for manufacturing organisations. Through literature review and experts' opinions, a total of thirty-four barriers and twenty-nine solutions were identified. For the ranking of barriers, the Best-worst method technique has been applied, and the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment technique is used for prioritisation of the solutions. The top barriers found out as lack of top management attitude towards sustainability concept, lack of project plans, techniques, and standard practices, lack of continuous improvement culture. The top solutions found are management participation to Sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation, provide consulting to top management regarding Sustainable Lean Six Sigma benefits, develop a cooperative organisational culture. The obtained results are expected to be helpful to the managers for the implementation of the Sustainable Lean Six Sigma in their organisations. Hence, the present study will provide valuable insights to the researchers and practitioners.},

The paper aims at a better understanding what market conditions and transaction attributes have favoured the emergence and the success of the Czech milk marketing cooperatives as well as if their current objectives and strategies are sufficient for securing their future success. The methodological approach rests largely in the theory of industrial organisation combined with the new institutional economics. Establishing marketing cooperatives, dairy farmers balanced market power with processing industry. It is showed on six case studies that the Czech milk marketing cooperatives follow traditional objectives ( securing sales, fair price and payment discipline); however, their priorities and strategies differ according to their market environment. If the concentration of the dairy industry continues, there will be a need for reconsidering the objectives of milk marketing cooperatives toward a more vertical coordination in the dairy chain.},

Rice-duck farming used to be widely adopted in tropical and subtropical eastern Asian countries, but has remained unpopular in the wake of prevailing agricultural productivism characterized by specialization, intensification, mechanization and excessive dependence on agrochemicals. This paper sets out institutional pathways that can redevelop IRDF in Asia. These include organic food certification systems, organic farmers' cooperatives, community-wide organic farming, localized technical extension and educational services, and between-farm rice-duck integration. A comprehensive package of these institutional tools would further expedite the expansion of IRDF particularly in low-income Southeast Asia where the rice or duck farming landscape is overwhelmingly dominated by smallholders.},

Most of the rice producers are constituted by small individual farmers characterized with mostly landless, have a less farming capitals and less access to pool resources and of course are confronted with various risk. Agriculture is faced with a lot of uncertainly most of which are not within the control of farmers. Global climatic change, climatic disasters, fluctuation of global economic and competitiveness of multinational company make difficulties of farmers to pursue his sustainable farming activity. The challenge and the role of government is to reduce uncertainly and to improve resiliency of the small farmer. Agriculture insurance shall focus on risk factors that are difficult to manage or cannot be managed by small farmers and it is should be viewed as just one aspect of the holistic risk management strategy. Technology, market, consumer, behaviour, development will always move forward, and no individual farmers can adapt this change alone, so small farmers need to corporate with each other that can optimized the resources they have. Cooperative could create possibilities, value added, shortening the supplied chain, made a product more effective and efficient, and finally can complete in domestic and global markets. Therefore, agriculture insurance as well a farmer cooperative may play an important role on sustainability of rice production in Indonesia.

We investigate the key players involved in standard making and delivery at the county level. We also analyse how and why the county government engages in standard-setting activities. We use Lin'an's bamboo shoot production industry as a case study to understand how the local state implements hazard-free, green and forest food production standards. The paper concludes that traditional conceptualizations of the local state do not sufficiently address how nature, knowledge of standards and state authority co-produce institutional capacity to control food supply and quality in China. In practice, the local state engages with non-state actors to achieve superficial environmental efforts, such as developing food production standards to throw a green cloak over a productivist model.},

Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucatan, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16 months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron-client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron-client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron-client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world's SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-avis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {That numerous rural laborers migrate to urban areas to find off-farm jobs has become an outstanding economic phenomenon in China. To examine the impact of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management, we built binary logistic models and Tobit models by applying a sample survey data of 500 households in rural Jiangxi in 2018. Households' participation and investment in forest management were measured by their labor and cash input. The results indicated that more off-farm laborers in household would hold back their participation in cash input. In contrast, a higher rate of female off-farm employment encouraged household monetary input. And households with more female agricultural laborers were more likely to participate in labor input. Neither off-farm employment nor female off-farm employment significantly influences households' labor input. Off-farm employment of the householder negatively influenced labor and cash input. Policy factors, such as obtaining forestry subsidies and forestry loans, joining forestry co-operative organizations, and better attitude to the logging quota system, also promoted households' participation and investment in forest management. Household head's age and education, forestry land status also affected participation in forest management. Our analysis could provide basis for managers to formulate policies to support sustainable forest management. Recommendations for Resource Managers: The econometric models applied in this research could reflect the influence of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management behavior and provide a quantitative basis for formulating forest management policies. There were great differences between rural households' forest management cash input behavior and labor input behavior and households were more active in labor input compared with cash input. The gender structure of rural labor off-farm employment could impact households' forest management participation and investment. To achieve sustainable forest management, managers should pay attention to enhancing female forestry technique training and encouraging forest land transfer and consolidation in the collective forest regions of China.},

To meet the proposed objective, this article uses a qualitative approach and descriptive character. As of Law No. 11.947 of 2009, the PNAE became one of the main access markets for family farmers and their collective organizations (cooperatives, associations or informal groups). In this context, collective organizations have become essential tools that work in different areas: in carrying out social and political articulations, in negotiating prices and delivery terms, in participating in the construction of Public Tenders and in intermediating the commercialization process, by fact of carrying out the purchase and sale operations, representing a group of producers in the PNAE. However, organizations face challenges of different natures, both to access and to expand access to the program, especially organizational, institutional and relational challenges. It was concluded that, due to the importance of cooperatives and associations in public policy implementation networks, it is necessary for the Brazilian State to support such tools, through articulations between the various actors involved and through planning and monitoring processes for the execution of the PNAE and of strengthening cooperativism and associativism.},

The concentration of power in the bureaucracy, the absence of accountability, the lack of an effective judicial mechanism, and existence of too many agencies with overlapping policy mandates are the direct reasons for the failure of management transfer over irrigation infrastructure (MTI) in China; accountability is problematic in irrigation systems with officials' primary accountability upward to their supervisors and to the political level. To enhance the level of farmers' participation, it is important to accelerate farmers' cooperative behavior by fostering the social circumstance of cooperation, providing technical support and establishing land transferring mechanism. Factors underlying the arrangement of governance structure are uncertain of future benefits, relative effectiveness of maintenance effort, and risk attitudes of different parties. The fundamental issue is the absence of manager's accountability to farmer users.},

Certified households were also compared with a non-certified group in each country. To analyze the differences in coffee price, volume, gross revenue and education between certifications, we used the Kruskal-Wallis ( K-W) non-parametric test and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test as a post-hoc procedure. Household savings, credit, food security and incidence of migration were analyzed through Pearson's chi-square test. Our study corroborated the conditions of economic poverty among small-scale coffee farmer households in Central America and Mexico. All certifications provided a higher price per pound and higher gross coffee revenue than non-certified coffee. However, the average volumes of coffee sold by individual households were low, and many certified farmers did not sell their entire production at certified prices. Certifications did not have a discernable effect on other livelihood-related variables, such as education, and incidence of migration at the household level, although they had a positive influence on savings and credit. Sales to certified markets offer farmers and cooperatives better prices, but the contribution derived from these premiums has limited effects on household livelihoods. This demonstrates that certifications will not single-handedly bring significant poverty alleviation to most coffee-farming families. Although certified coffee markets alone will not resolve the livelihood challenges faced by smallholder households, they could still contribute to broad-based sustainable livelihoods, rural development and conservation processes in coffee regions. This can be done by developing more active partnerships between farmers, cooperatives, certifications and environmental and rural development organizations and researchers in coffee regions. Certifications, especially Fair Trade/organic, have proven effective in supporting capacity building and in serving as networks that leverage global development funding for small-scale coffee-producing households.},

    abstract = {The classical game-theoretical models described the conflict in fisheries arising from harvesting a 'common pool resource' which without an efficient regulation leads to an over-exploitation of a renewable but not unlimited resource, known as the 'tragedy of the commons'. Unlike these studies, the present paper deals with a marketing cooperative of micro or small enterprises in fishing industry, formed to negotiate a contracted price with large buyers, sharing risk among members of the cooperative. In the paper a game-theoretical model for the behaviour in this cooperative is set up. By the time of the actual commercialization of the product, the market price may be higher than what the cooperative can guarantee for members, negotiated on beforehand. Therefore some unfaithful members may be interested in selling at least a part of their product on the free market, the cooperative, however, can punish them for this. This conflict is modelled with a multi-person normal form game. An evolutionary dynamics is proposed for the continuous change of the applied strategies, which in the long term leads to a particular Nash equilibrium, considered the solution of the game. This strategy dynamics is continuously influenced by an exosystem describing the dynamics of fishing, based on a classical fishing effort model. This approach focuses only on the conflict within the marketing cooperative, since it is supposed that the single enterprises fish from independent resources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

    abstract = {This paper relies on literature review and primary data collected through in-depth interviews with 21 respondents to examine the political economy dynamics of the cocoa value chain in Ghana. The historical analysis, which was based on the political settlements framework, has shown that the policies implemented in the cocoa sector went through four periods. The colonial era was characterised by a fairly corporate governance system and struggle between European traders and farmer cooperatives for monopoly over internal marketing of cocoa. This was followed by the early post-independence era (1957-1980), which was characterised by neopatrimonialism and over-taxation of cocoa farmers. The third phase (1980-2000) witnessed economic reforms and liberalisation. The fourth phase (2000 to present) saw increased public-private partnerships aimed at empowering women and promoting environmentally friendly farming activities. The paper concludes that the policies in the cocoa sector have, historically, created more benefits (rents) to political elite and their crony capitalists. Given that rent-seeking behaviour is a threat to the sustainability of the cocoa sector, the paper urges international development partners and civil society groups to demand greater accountability and transparency from the political elite and state institutions in the cocoa sector.},

In 2006, 23.6% of mortgages from commercial banks were subprime versus only 3.6% of mortgages from credit unions. Moreover, banks were more likely to fail, and had higher delinquency and net charge-off ratios immediately following the financial crisis. Our empirical models control for important differences between credit unions and banks including firm-level characteristics, borrower-level characteristics, and state-level economic conditions. We argue that the remaining difference captures the effects of credit unions' nonprofit and cooperative structure, which encourages them to internalize the utility of their customer-owners. Our findings explain why credit unions often appear more risk averse relative to commercial banks, a result with important research and policy implications.

In this paper, we look more closely at potential relationships between the development of producers' organizations (POs) and the size of their membership. Then, we link the size of the membership with the concept of social capital. For our purposes, it is necessary to depart from using a general concept of social capital and to differentiate between bonding and bridging social capital. Our results, based on two unique datasets from Poland, clearly showed that relatively larger POs have higher rates of survival. This, in turn, is correlated with the stock and the type of social capital. The main contribution of the study is in identifying the relevance of the size of the membership of newly-established POs to their survival. The findings are followed by policy recommendations that may be useful in the context of promoting farmers' cooperation in recognizing the low stock of social capital, specifically bridging social capital.},

The farmers had varying perspectives about the factors that led to SGMA and varying responses to the regulation. They suggested that drought, competing agricultural and urban uses, and an increase in perennial crops were factors in recent water use, resulting in changes to water quality and quantity. Impacts of those changes included variable well levels, increased infrastructure costs, and ecosystem impacts, which farmers had responded to by implementing multiple management strategies. Additional research in other regions is imperative to provide farmers' viewpoints and strategies to policymakers, irrigation districts, farmer cooperatives, and the agricultural industry and give farmers a voice at the table.},

This framework is productive, showing how some Nuevo Mexicano farmers (and others) orient toward farming, sustenance, and human-nature relationships through community, family, heritage, and education. Moreover, in addition to a conceptualization of sustainability as specific practices for nurturing and enduring in environments, communities, and organizations/institutions, sustainability can be understood as embedded ecocultural and historical experience with cross-cultural parallels in land-based communities. This study advances the ethical duty of environmental communication to better understand the ways in which environmental discourse and ecocultural and material realities are imbricated, as well as the call for such discursive study to be grounded in phenomenological experience of the natural world.},

ICARDA is the only IARC with a currently functional seed unit. However, all IARCs participate in seed sector improvement in various ways, e.g., production of small quantities of breeder/basic seed; technical advice on seed production to NARS, public and private companies, NGOs, and farmers' cooperatives; monitoring adoption and seed production of released varieties; assessing constraints to seed multiplication and marketing; training of seed sector staff; information dissemination through brochures and seed production manuals; and provision of policy advice to governments.},

Data were collected from the 100 largest credit unions from nine Canadian provinces and assessed through qualitative content analysis. Results show that Canadian credit unions have implemented accommodative and proactive approaches when addressing COVID-19, through more operational than financial actions directed to their clients and employees, and that those with larger assets implement a greater number of actions compared to credit unions with smaller assets. More importantly, results show that traditional CSR2 approaches (e.g., RDAP) do not fit unexpected crises, so novel approaches are required to face future crises and remain resilient. While we aim to contribute to the body of literature by examining how credit unions have assisted their stakeholders during the pandemic, we also, and most importantly, seek to provide material for discussing and reflecting on how organizations are prepared to face crises that will likely arise in the future.},

That is, we will determine whether its application will increase the bank's assertiveness in identifying credit unions whose managers have taken discretionary actions which diverge from regulatory standards Method: Benford's Law was applied to all singular Brazilian credit unions from 2006 to 2017 - which is a relevant timeframe due to regulatory changes - for Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Cash, and LPCSL (Loss Provisions for Client/Credit accounts which have Suspicious Liquidations) accounts over various timeframes. Relevance: The discussed evidence offers elements that can improve regulation mechanisms, and it can also indicate whether managers are using their discretionary power to influence singular credit union performance Results: Time is an important factor in the use of this tool. Applications applied over a long period of time do not capture discretionary actions taken by managers due to potential adjustments made to variations over time. An annual timeframe makes it possible to use this technique to capture potential discretionary actions taken in the examined accounts. In addition, this technique generates a consistent list of credit unions which require more intense surveillance and/or investigation. It also indicates that the norms revised in 2015 have helped reduce incentives to manage earnings and/or commit fraud in these organizations. Methodological Contributions: This study fills a gap in the credit union literature because there are few studies of discretionary actions in these organizations such as accounting choices, earnings management, fraud, or errors. Our findings may also indicate adjustments made by credit unions to comply with the sector standard due to the adoption of Resolutions No. 4,434 and No. 4,454. Benford's Law is useful as a tool in selecting audit samples, and it can also improve the work of supervisory bodies.},

The analysis shows that villages characterized by ascribed power and inherited hierarchy (chief villages) provide less structural support for the founding and operation of credit unions and are less likely to adopt credit unions than communities whose leadership is determined by individual merits and achievement (big man villages). This finding suggests that existing authority structures in these traditional societies constrain incentive schemes and trust structures critical to the founding and persistence of new economic organizations.},

They play a major role in providing micro-credits in many regions. At the end of 2014, there were 57 408 credit unions in 105 countries with more than 217.4 million members and approximately USD 1792.94 billion assets. This indicates on the necessity to analyse the performance of credit unions. The research aim is to identify the features and performance characteristics of the credit unions based on a particular insight into the operation of credit unions in the Baltic States. It was concluded that in many countries credit unions were operating at a loan-to-asset ratio which was much lower than the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) requirements. Among the Baltic States, Lithuania is the leader in terms of credit unions as it almost twice outpaces Latvia, while Estonia considerably lags behind. In Latvia, credit unions have managed to preserve a stable increase related to attraction of savings and deposits. This means that the members trust credit unions and see the significance and convenience joining them. Similar conclusions may be drawn regarding the amount of disbursed loans.},

Drying conditions, energy consumption and product quality were monitored over three trials. Energy performance was analysed using instantaneous indices, leading to suggestions for possible design-modifications. About 29.8% of the heat input was used for moisture evaporation, 38.4% was lost via unsaturated exhaust air and 17.6% was lost to the ambient environment. An optimum air flow rate, one that minimises exhaust heat losses without increasing the drying time, was calculated. Temperature and air flow within the drying chamber varied, resulting in a non-uniform batch. To improve performance, a new design for the drying chamber air inlet is recommended.},

    abstract = {A possible sustainable growth of credit unions is being examined in this paper. Credit unions have a rich history. Some, however, adhere more closely to their historical roots than others. These credit unions base their philosophy on the premise that members, in a voluntary capacity, actively participate in the governance and the running of the credit union; and that the credit union should not develop beyond a size and level of financial sophistication at which individual members can fully contribute in this capacity. Other credit unions have strayed far from their historical roots. Moreover the analysis of contemporary credit unions conceptions and problems of management improvement are performed. In addition theoretical priorities for credibility and international capabilities of credit unions are presented. A sketch of some actual theories is being performed and methods for analysis of credit unions' activities are particularly composed. Following method of improvement of observational research was performed in this paper. In order to evaluate common tendencies of activities of the credit unions in the World and particularly in the European Union the financial institutions' legal regulations are specially surveyed. Furthermore legal regulations of credit unions are analyzed in practice for local and international credit unions of Lithuania. The preliminary evaluation of the credit unions activity in the circumstances of contemporary waves of the financial crisis is presented. After examining available and possible theoretical and practical aspects the assumptions from the analyzed material are proposed. The article discusses the development of credit unions and the factors affecting the credit union managers approach to the credit union system development prospects. Despite an occurrence of the recent commercial banks global situation concerning the possible disappointment of consumers - credit unions are one of the best institutions for further financial sustainability in the retail credit markets.},

The results from the costs and returns analysis shows the poultry layer production in the study area was profitable. The average returns per Naira invested the farmer will realize 0.58. Thus, the net farm income obtained is higher than the total costs incurred by the layer poultry farmer in the study area. Income can still be improved upon with appropriate pricing, adoption of proper management practices and accessing low cost inputs through bulk purchasing by farmers' cooperatives. The constraint faced by the layer farmers are limited access to credit, high cost of feed, frequent outbreak of diseases and high cost of vaccine and medication. It is recommended that appropriate input pricing, formation of society with the aim of purchasing feed mixing equipment which will help to reduce the cost of feed and adoption of proper management practices will improve income.},

Design/methodology/approach This research employs univariate tests of differences to examine the median growth rates for commercial banks and credit unions. Unbalanced pool regressions analyze growth rates during the pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery periods, controlling for size, net charge-offs, and unemployment. Findings Univariate test results that control for size show that banks grow at faster rates than credit unions for most of the pre-crisis years. However, medium sized credit unions grow at faster rates for most of the crisis and recovery years. Results of unbalanced pool regressions suggest that, overall, credit unions grow at slower rates than do banks. However, during the crisis and recovery, credit union growth is significantly greater than that of banks, after controlling for net charge-offs, size, and unemployment. Credit union growth varies by field of membership type.

First, it analyses the income structure in cooperative financial institutions and examines how traditional and non-traditional incomes are related. Second, it evaluates whether increasing diversification towards non-traditional incomes facilitates or hampers the benefits of financial cooperative owners. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from over 3,100 US credit unions over the period of 1994-2016. A number of modern econometric techniques are employed throughout the analysis, including the use of panel fixed effect, generalised method of moments (GMM) and two-stage least square (2SLS) methodologies. Findings Using US credit unions as the empirical setting, the empirical results reveal that the expansion of traditional income leads to a corresponding increase in income from non-traditional activities. However, an increasing reliance on non-traditional income causes a significant drop in interest margins. The authors also find that the extent to which income diversification affects owner benefit varies across credit union types and period of time. While income diversification negatively affects owners' benefits in single common bond credit unions, it has no significant influence on multiple common bond and community credit union owners' benefits. Third, diversification can be beneficial during crisis time, but can be detrimental to owner benefit during normal time. Originality/value This paper provides some of the first empirical investigations on the diversification strategy of cooperative financial institutions. Therefore, the results offer significant policy implications for policymakers and market participants on whether financial cooperatives should diversify or specialise.},

The rating model was estimated through multinomial logistic regression. The total accuracy was 80.1%. With the model results and considering its high accuracy degree, it is possible to verify that the use of PEARLS model allowed the development of a model for monitoring the risks that credit unions represent to financial market. The achieved rating model is simple and has a practical relevance to agents. The academic relevance is related to the methodology for economic-financial assessment of credit unions which can be a reference for future studies. Moreover, the relevance is highlighted due to lack of studies on ratings to assess financial firms in Brazil.},

The aggregated savings to credit union members is larger than the estimated value of the credit union corporate income tax exemption.

However, changes in these two types of buffers are negatively related to changes in the loans to assets ratios. This finding suggests that to adjust their capital buffers, Canadian credit unions curtail their loans and underscores the importance of the Basel III conservation and the countercyclical buffer requirements in fostering credit. Further, we show that the risk-based capital buffer is positively related to the credit cycle. However, a mechanical application of the rule based on the credit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) gap to activate the countercyclical buffer, would have misguided Canadian credit unions.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the agribusiness practices adopted by cooperatives and associations of farmers in Para state (Eastern Amazon, Brazil) and the importance they attribute to environmental conservation. The methodology consisted of remotely conducting interviews based on a questionnaire with farmer cooperatives and associations. We found that the main products produced by the cooperatives and associations were fruits and their derivatives. In addition, we identified a significant positive relationship between the operation duration of a cooperative or association and the number of products they produced. Regarding the challenges faced by cooperatives, legal challenges were most notable, while the challenges faced by associations were related to environmental issues. Notably, associa-tions and cooperatives showed low agreement considering the importance of each conservation practices analyzed. The results also suggested that the current subsidies granted to cooperatives and associations have nonsignificant impacts on the intensity of their adoption of environmental conservation practices, implying that monetary incentives are effective only with cooperatives/associations that have weaker attitudes toward the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. Agricultural policy should consider both economic support and effective and continuous programs focusing on the sustainable use of natural resources.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Advisory organisations with incorporated research and development (R&D) can translate findings from both their own research projects and external sources, which increases their absorptive capacity and boosts service innovation. Further, systematic emphasis on continuous learning strengthens AC, as do networking and internal communications. Practical implications: By improving the incorporation of R&D, continuous learning and networking, advisory service organisations can benefit from the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS). Ultimately farmers can receive more updated and relevant services for their farms. Theoretical implications: Incorporation of R&D, continuous learning and networking are significant social integration mechanisms that can improve a firm's AC.

Second, we examine how competition affects the difference in risk-taking between these two types of financial institutions. To answer both questions, we rely on a matched sample (by loan type, size, and county) of commercial banks and credit unions, covering the period between 2010 and 2017. We use three empirical proxies for risk-taking, the Z-score, measuring an institution's insolvency risk, as well as the ratios of non-performing loans to total loans and loan charge-offs to total loans, measuring the credit risk. Our results suggest that banks tend to engage in more risk-taking than credit unions; however, state regulatory oversight reduces the risk-taking gap, especially in terms of the Z-score. We further find that competition induces different risktaking behaviors in banks and credit unions. Our results are robust to several alternative specifications.},

Through the development of an 'economy of qualities' (Callon et al. 2002) within the food market there have been a number of private initiatives by major retailers, farmers' cooperatives, independent standard bodies, manufacturing brands within the UK which has supported the development of a market for 'welfare-friendly' food products. How do these organisations work together to realise the economic potential through product labelling or corporate branding of meat/dairy or egg products from welfare-friendly production practices?

    abstract = {This study focuses on the potential role of technical and institutional innovations for improving water management in a multi-user context in Burkina Faso. We focus on a system centered on three reservoirs that capture the waters of the Upper Comoe River Basin and servicing a diversity of users, including a sugar manufacturing company, a urban water supply utility, a farmer cooperative, and other downstream users. Due to variable and declining rainfall and expanding users' needs, drastic fluctuations in water supply and demand occur during each dry season. A decision support tool was developed through participatory research to enable users to assess the impact of alternative release and diversion schedules on deficits faced by each user. The tool is meant to be applied in the context of consultative planning by a local user committee that has been created by a new national integrated water management policy. We contend that both solid science and good governance are instrumental in realizing efficient and equitable water management and adaptation to climate variability and change. But, while modeling tools and negotiation platforms may assist users in managing climate risk, they also introduce additional uncertainties into the deliberative process. It is therefore imperative to understand how these technological and institutional innovations frame water use issues and decisions to ensure that such framing is consistent with the goals of integrated water resource management.},

Design/methodology/approach - The method adopted was the Classic Linear Regression Model with Panel Data, estimated by Feasible Generalized Least Squares for fixed effects and corrections for heteroscedasticity. The sample was made up of 113 credit unions affiliated to UNICRED systems, over the 2001-2011 period, and data was made available by Central Bank of Brazil. Findings - The analysis, carried out through non-discretionary results on credit operations in order to explain the changes in net expenses of provision on credit operations, indicated there was smoothing of results. Thus, we can infer that the credit unions affiliated to UNICRED make use of earnings management in the income smoothing modality. Originality/value -This study contributes to the issue of Accounting Results Management, and corroborates that there are indications that, in the occurrence of higher non-discretionary results, credit unions tend to maximize provisions. Similarly, in the occurrence of lower non-discretionary results, they tend to minimize provisions, making evident the search for smaller variability in results, thus signaling mitigation of risks.},

    abstract = {Purpose This study assesses the potential impact of the European Income Stabilization Tool (IST - a whole farm income risk management [RM] tool) within a farm cooperative specializing in vineyards and operating in a small area of production. The authors assess the conditions under which IST could improve the well-being of the associated farmers and, at the same time, improve financial sustainability. Financial aspects are of particular relevance since the characteristics of the cooperative cause the management of the tool to become potentially risky. Design/methodology/approach The analysis relies on a balanced panel dataset to report the production and economic characteristics of individual associated farms. This is the basis for simulating the implementation of the IST as described in the current European regulation. The expected utility approach is then used to assess the potential impact on farmers' well-being under different levels of risk aversion and premiums. The analysis of the IST annual cash flow allows for an accurate assessment of its financial sustainability. Findings The results suggest that the IST can improve farmers' well-being under plausible levels of risk aversion and premiums, making most farmers willing to support its implementation. Furthermore, the tool could be financially sustainable even if implemented in a specialized and geographically concentrated group of farms. In addition, the results suggest that the use of strategies such as the IST could help cope with negative annual balances by treating the financial sustainability of the fund. Originality/value The analysis adds to previous research on the IST by accounting for farmers' risk aversion. Furthermore, it is the first analysis that simulates the implementation of this tool in a sector-specific and concentrated group of farms. The results provide useful evidence for those subjects planning to implement the IST in small and specialized farming systems.},

A dry season decline in milk production of over 40% due to feed scarcity is a common phenomenon. Adoption of improved feed production, conservation and utilization technologies and practices in dairy farming communities is poor. This review work was based on a key question which states Why is adoption of improved dairy nutrition technologies and practices in Tanzania still poor despite being promoted for decades?. We have shown that major opportunities for curbing dry season animal feed shortage include on-farm optimization of production and use of high yielding pasture varieties including napier grass (Pennisetum purperium Schumach.) and leguminous fodder species. Crop residues in particular maize stover needs to be optimized for effective dry season feeding. The major reasons for low adoption of proven technologies include limited technical knowhow among smallholder dairy farmers augmented by limited extension services and technological costs. For enhancing sustainable uptake; we suggest promotion of on-farm research, public-private partnerships and dairy farmers' cooperative associations. These are vital for facilitating smooth access to information, investment capital, reliable inputs and markets among the smallholder dairy farmers.},

Thus the net farm income obtained is higher than the total costs incurred by the dry season farmers in the study area. This indicates that there is positive effects/impact on dry season farming in the study area. Income can still be improved upon with appropriate pricing, adoption of proper management practices, uniform water fee collection policy and accessing low cost inputs through bulk purchasing by farmers cooperatives. The constraint faced by the dry season farmers are limited access to credit, irrigation pumps and accessories, marketing system, seed, fertilizer, diseases and pests. It is recommended that appropriate input pricing, access to bank loan, provision of good marketing system, formation of FADAMA users association with aim of purchasing seed, fertilizer and chemicals which will help to reduce the cost and adoption of proper management practices will improve income.},

However, the recent crisis has complicated the activity and margins of financial entities in Spain, which has derived in a deep credit crunch in the Spanish economy. In the middle of the dramatic restructuring and recapitalization process implemented by Spanish commercial banks, credit unions have strengthened their solvency and increased their market share during the crisis period. Despite this evidence, in general, credit unions have been considered less efficient than commercial banks because they have a dual nature: on the one hand, these companies are cooperatives so they are Social Economy enterprises, and, on the other hand, they are entities in the banking system. However, few studies have focused on empirically evaluating their efficiency, and even less in a crisis context. This study aims to estimate the financial efficiency in the banking activity of Spanish credit unions during the period 2008-2013 and to analyse their determinants. To achieve these objectives, an innovative two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is applied under the condition of national and sectorial homogeneity. Our results suggest that credit unions in Spain were quite inefficient in their banking activity during the crisis period, although they were able to improve the management of their inputs to obtain their financial outputs year after year. The findings also show that both the agglomeration in urban areas and the regional effect have influenced significantly on their financial efficiency.},

In contrast to banks that generate profit for outside investors and do not give voice to customers, these not-for-profit institutions have a democratic governance structure and a mission to provide good services to their members. We use diverse economies and critical/feminist geographic information system (GIS) approaches to theorize them as noncapitalist alternatives to banks and possible sites of social transformation toward a solidarity economy. Using the case of cooperative finance in New York City, we analyze spatial patterns, characteristics, and placemaking practices of credit unions with different kinds of the common bond, a principle that unites a financial community, and in relation to urban geographies of class and race. We find that credit unions provide a historically proven mechanism for collective resistance to marginalization by racial capitalism and, depending on the common bond type, make place by (1) providing financial inclusion in poor and minority neighborhoods; (2) scaling up solidarity finance through participation of middle classes; and (3) diverting assets from capitalist investment into social reproduction and livelihoods. Credit unions express the racialized wealth of their communities, however, and create spatial exclusions that pose a challenge to postcapitalist movements such as solidarity economy. These findings are applicable to other places marked by segregation and call for further inquiry into possibilities and barriers to solidarity finance.

We argue that channel diversity is positively associated with a firm's profitability and negatively associated with its profit volatility, and that channel diversity and product diversity are complementary in driving these profit-enhancing and volatility-suppressing effects. We test our hypotheses in the U.S. credit union industry, in which credit unions offer a variety of loan and deposit products through a variety of online and offline channels, including physical branches, ATMs, telephone banking, online banking, and mobile banking. By analyzing a longitudinal dataset of 7577 credit unions in 2009-2016, the study provides empirical evidence that operating a full spectrum of online and offline channels leads to higher profitability and lower profit volatility for credit unions. The study also reveals differential moderating effects of loan product diversity and deposit product diversity, in that loan product diversity enhances the profit-enhancing effect of channel diversity while deposit product diversity enhances the volatility-suppressing effect of channel diversity. This paper contributes to the studies of channel-based strategic differentiation as a competitive strategy and the studies of firms' risk-return performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we introduce REALISTIC, a novel event-based modeling framework for supply chain networks (SCNs) that includes production processes. It extends McCarty's Resources-Events-Agents (REA) accounting model with secure transformations, which, across the entire SCN, guarantee that certified output resources cannot be digitally produced ex nihilo, but require certified input resources of at least the same amount as what is produced. This generalizes the no-double-spend guarantee of current BC/DLT to (digital twins of) physical resources and their production. Authenticated human or robotic Internet of Things (IoT) actors digitally sign and cryptographically commit to the veracity of real-world events on an immutable database, without having to take responsibility for their aggregate consequences. User-specifiable interpretations, corresponding to queries and analytical functions in database systems, provide auditable aggregate information computed from recorded events across the entire SCN. This includes fine-grained and trustworthy tracing of final products through multiple stages of production processes, semi-finished products, quality certifications and transportation all the way back to their raw materials. We present a case study for an end-to-end coffee supply chain that tracks fine-grained and detailed information from a farmer's coffee cherries to retail coffee bags, involving all its actors. Our model handles product provenance; auditable sustainability, quality and trade information; production processes from parchment via green to roasted coffee; product quality tests; farmer certifications; and transportation across the entire coffee supply chain. It is based on field work involving farmers, cooperatives, processors, traders, importers, and a major roasting company stretching from Colombia to Scandinavia. Its REALISTIC-based modeling is the foundation for the design of our prototype implementation, which includes Ethereum blockchain code, RDBMS-based server code and a web app client.

Commercial banks claim that credit unions are no different than banks and that the credit union tax exemption represents an unfair competitive advantage. Credit unions counter that while they offer similar products and services, they differ from commercial banks in terms of structure and mission, given their not-for-profit, cooperative status. In this paper, we test for substantive differences in the objective functions of commercial banks and nonprofit credit unions by comparing CEO compensation structures. Drawing on the relevant principal-agent literature, we provide several arguments to support the hypotheses that credit union boards of directors establish lower-powered incentive contracts with their CEOs relative to similarly sized commercial banks, and offer lower total compensation. We find that credit union CEOs receive approximately 250% less performance-based compensation relative to CEOs of similarly sized community banks. Bank CEOs also earn approximately 15% to 20% more total compensation on average. The results are generally robust to controlling for CEO- and board-level characteristics, local economic conditions, and institution-level indicators of size, growth, complexity, liquidity and risk. The findings suggest important differences in incentive structures and objectives between banks and credit unions.},

    abstract = {The potential of co-operative working within the farming sector has received increasing interest in recent years, given a range of potential benefits. However, uncertainty persists in understanding the balance between individual and collective priority, how members inter-relate and negotiate these different motivations over time, and how this connects to different forms of outcome. This paper evaluates the experiences of the Pontbren farmer co-operative in Mid-Wales (UK) to explore these issues, as an exemplar of the multiple and sometimes unexpected outcomes of co-operative activity. Here-in day-to-day practices and emotional affects are highlighted as critical elements of co-operation alongside the skills and know-how required to sustain working relations. In addition, the farmers' changing sense of self is considered to evaluate the extent to which co-operation can bring about new forms of identification. The approach outlined aims to augment existing Bourdieu-inspired readings of social learning and capital exchange with insights from the literature on social practice and diverse economies (following the work of Elizabeth Shove, J.K. Gibson-Graham and colleagues). Overall, findings demonstrate a need to frame co-operation as an emergent process which can move the individuals involved beyond preformed judgements and measures of social positioning, altering their conceptions of how to relate to others. Moreover, it is argued that the value of this relatedness needs to be understood in more expansive terms, and not only as calculable forms of 'capital'. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The availability of these water resources, however, is extremely seasonal because of the patterns of the annual rain season(s) and the increasing effects of climate change all over the world. A survey was conducted at Golinga and Botanga irrigation schemes in Northern Ghana where 200 respondents were interviewed. The objectives of this study include: (i) to assess the management and sustainability of irrigation projects, (ii) to find out the impact of the irrigation projects on rural communities' development, (iii) to find out the challenges that hinders farmers from effectively using irrigation water from the perspective of farmers and to find the possible solutions to the challenges. 38 and 40% of respondents from Golinga and Botanga irrigation schemes respectively agreed that cropping areas have moderately expanded due to the presence of irrigation scheme however, 52 and 39% of respondents from both schemes respectively indicated that the presence of the irrigation scheme to them has little impact in helping farmers expand their cropping areas. There was also moderate increase in crop yields in both communities due to the constant water supply to farmers obtained from irrigation projects. The study shows that the major challenge that hinders farmers from using irrigation water is the high cost of renting irrigable land for farming in the irrigation schemes indicated by a response of 47 and 64% amongst farmers in Botanga and Golinga irrigation schemes respectively. The study suggests that the need for relevant stakeholders to; revise the cost of renting irrigable lands, acquire and adopt the use of simple and affordable technologies (machines), implement reforms and policies to reduce land consolidation and fragmentation, organize and mobilize farmers in farmer cooperatives to promote collective marketing and organize capacity building sessions for farmers regarding the project sustainability.},

The equity/asset ratio is shown to provide as good a prediction of failure as any of the other models, and is not improved upon by the much more complex Z-score model. The best DEA model provides results comparable to the equity/asset ratio when a slack adjusted efficiency score is used to measure efficiency, particularly for Credit Unions with larger asset sizes. However, DEA also provides indications of where opportunities lie for improvements by weak units by providing specific information, relevant to managers. Hence, for each Credit Union, comparison is made with a peer group of efficient entities that the inefficient institution's management can emulate to improve their performance.

This paper starts with the status quo of rural credit and credit, analyzes the evaluation index of rural household credit, analyzes the difficulty of credit evaluation of farmers and the difficulty of loan based on the related financial theory such as herding effect, and then gives the strategy of perfecting the credit evaluation system of farmers. Rural credit cooperatives provide advice on credit risk control. On this basis, reduce the bad debt risk of rural financial institutions and the financing risks of high-credit farmers, promote the implementation of rural preferential loan policies, and promote the smooth development of rural household credit business, so that rural finance can flourish.},

    abstract = {Rice industry is vital for food security and the economic development of Myanmar as its economy relies on agriculture sector. Promoting the marketing capability of farmers especially the smallholders is the key challenge of increasing farm investment. The rice farmers generally have channels selling to (1) the brokers or commission men who come and collect at the farm gate, (2) the collectors or traders at the farm gate, and (3) selling directly to the rice mills nearby towns. Assessing from different channels is central for exploiting the potential to increase production, farm income and investment. However there are restrictions in channel choices because of poor infrastructure, lack of marketing facilities, insufficient credit and up to date market information. Moreover, due to the oligopsony market structure and without organization, individual marketing practices exposes them to high transaction costs with low bargaining position. The majority of farmers unable to receive a fair price as they have to sell their products soon after harvest when the price is generally low because of the immediate cash need for repayment. So, the farmers cannot maximize profit which in turn affects the future investment of paddy farmers. This paper investigates the factors determine the marketing channel choice using the Multinomial Logit Model. The results show the probability of selling at the farm gate is increase with the distance to market. The farmers who possess storage, transportation, larger quantity and access of market information are more likely to sell the remunerative direct marketing channels to the rice mills directly. The result underscore the importance of forming the farmers' cooperative, development of marketing infrastructures, accessibility of up to date marketing information in order to support farmers bargaining power to develop farm's profit and investment.},

Water table depth and groundwater salinity are important factors in irrigation systems, not only for plant growth but for human health as well. The objective of this study was to determine the impact on water table depth and groundwater salinity for transferring management of the Mustafakemalpasa irrigation project (19, 370 ha) in north-western Turkey to local, farmer controlled irrigation districts. Maps of water table depth and groundwater salinity were created for the a month of July (averaged over several years), the month with the highest amount of applied irrigation water, based on measurements made in 200 wells in the project area before and after transfer of managerial control. Both depth of the water table and salinity decreased after transfer The area with average water table depth of 100-200 cm was 25.41% of total area before turnover and 79.45% after and the area with water table depth 200-300 cm was 73.4% before turnover and 20.50% after before turnover, the area with average groundwater salinity 1.5-2.0 dS/m was 26.16% of total area, and that with average salinity 2.0-2.5 dS/m was 61.73% of total area; after turnover, average groundwater salinity was 1.5-2.0 dS/m in over all areas. Both changes were the consequence of an increased amount of applied water after transfer of the control of irrigation management from the state to local irrigatior districts controlled by farmers. In the short run, the farmers will get benefit from increased irrigation. However, over the long term, if water table depth continues to decrease then secondary salinization could become a major hindrance to irrigation sustainability.},

Design/methodology/approach This research is a qualitative study that uses the knowledge of specialists to frame a performance assessment structure applied to credit unions. The research strategy is based on multicriteria analysis, and the selected techniques are based on the MCDA-C procedure, that is, the processes of structuring, evaluating and recommending improvements. Findings The research results provided: a data set external to the context that serves as theoretical support for the comparisons made; the structuring of 4 unique organisational performance assessment models carried out through the MCDA-C procedure; conceptual interpretation using the lens of the operations strategy in the cognitive maps of the assessment models, which identifies the operations strategy carried out; and comparison of the result models that show their uniqueness. Originality/value The comparison between the origins of knowledge is highlighted, and the demonstration of the content was proposed by the literature and by specialists to evaluate the performance in operations. This was then compared with the content constructed with credit union managers in structuring models based on the singularities of the respective contexts. The theory was compared to practice, and it was demonstrated how the content of the operations regarding the performance could be used in decision contexts.},

First, many democratic labor unions supported or led by YDP-UIM played a significant role historically in establishing the Korean Federation of Trade Unions. Second, credit unions introduced to the GIC by YDP-UIM saw unexpected success in protecting GIC industrial workers from falling prey to institutionalized usurers, and the National Credit Union Federation of Korea has grown today to become the world's third largest credit union federation. In-depth interviews with YDP-UIM's leading activists, however, repeatedly reveal that their practical innovation was the result of their self-reflective interaction with industrial workers alienated from religion itself as well from established society. Finally, these interviews point out how and why the positive relationship between religious innovation and free competition posited by religious market theorists should be revised, both theoretically and empirically, in the Korean context.},

Restrictive monetary policy makes it increasingly difficult for banking institutions to take loans, thus they turn to the general population as a money source. Their interest is partly served through inclusion of financially inactive population. As the new legislation will correct the current illogical situation (some deposit institutions have not been under control of the central bank), this will eliminate the unfair competition which is at the moment existing in the banking system. At the same time, the operation of a new form of non-profit deposit institutions, i.e. credit unions, will be regulated. With solidarity and common interest as the basic tenets of their operation they can be attractive to this particular segment of population.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the affect theory of social exchange, a theoretical model was developed and empirically tested using a survey of 691 employees from 15 North American credit unions. Findings - The negotiated mode of knowledge exchange, i.e. when a knowledge contributor explicitly establishes reciprocation conditions with a recipient, develops negative knowledge sharing attitude. The reciprocal mode, i.e. when a knowledge donor assumes that a receiver will reciprocate, has no effect on knowledge sharing attitude. The generalized exchange form, i.e. when a knowledge contributor believes that other organizational members may reciprocate, is weakly related to knowledge sharing attitude. The productive exchange mode, i.e. when a knowledge provider assumes he or she is a responsible citizen within a cooperative enterprise, strongly facilitates the development of knowledge sharing attitude, which, in turn, leads to knowledge sharing intentions. Practical implications - To facilitate inter-employee knowledge sharing, managers should focus on the development of positive knowledge sharing culture when all employees believe they contribute to a common good instead of expecting reciprocal benefits. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to apply the affect theory of social exchange to study knowledge sharing.},

Growing multi local economic activity stimulates innovative enterprises for cooperation with stakeholders. Usually, it means consumers, suppliers, authorities and government involvement in change processes. If achievement of interests balance is clear and transparent for all stakeholders, they will be change agents. Modern experience in streamlining social and economic relations between stakeholders focuses on the development of functional institutions that can act as agents of change. Forms of organization of such institutions can be clusters, technology parks, holdings, management companies, joint-stock companies, state-owned companies, manufacturers' associations, marketing cooperatives, and professional communities. Research methods are statistics index analysis and network analysis. Working with these research methods, World Bank Input-Output Database, Federal Custom data, Rosstat data and law searching system we prove impossibility of full-fledged cluster policy implementation. Finally we prove that present Russian institutes are complacent and require more transparency.

The results also suggest that due to incomplete information, farmers and market agents suffer from high transaction costs. Skewed information distribution between farmers and marketing agents leads to slow development of vegetable enterprises.

The superficial reason for such bad financial services in rural areas lies in the idea that people with little money are not suitable enough clients for financial institutions. Social discrepancies between urban and rural areas have been officially stated to exist in Latvia according to the report about social inclusion of the European Commission. Microfinance is seen as a widely accepted tool to combat these discrepancies. Nevertheless the vocabulary of microfinance can be understood only by professionals, even if it is intended for the masses. The sector is very fragmented, and there is not even a proper definition of the term yet. Activities in the Microfinance sector identified in Latvia can be assigned to the following models: credit unions; downscaling of commercial bank activities; and NGO based programmes and projects. Recommendations to improve the Microfinance sector in Latvia and especially to combine the existing trends of commercial banks to downsize their activities with supportive measures are: target subsidies toward institution building. providing incentives to encourage greater focus and innovation in the development of financial services for the poor; increasing cooperation and partnership, both among all types of microfinance providers and between them and mainstream banks, to increase financial service provision to the poor; improving the legal and regulatory environment for microfinance and for credit unions specifically Within all these discussions it is very important to emphasize that the access to advice, education and training is regarded as equally relevant as the access to finance. The advantage for Eastern Europe may be that there are much more industry sectors here to offer opportunities for rural development than in other regions of the world that suffer from bad infrastructures and low educational levels.},

In this study, numerous aspects responsible for the success of India's Dairy Cooperative Society (DCS) have been taken into account before developing a composite index. The criteria addressed include milk union support, DCS support, governance and management support, allied support, and common support factors for DCS performance evaluation. The current study is projected to empower the dairy industry by offering a tool that can evaluate the relative success of DCSs and assist milk unions and dairy organizations in tailoring their assistance to their specific requirements. We deployed the Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP) to determine the weights of specified criteria and sub-criteria impacting DCS performance; these weights were deployed to determine the relative performance of a DCS using the composite index developed in the study. Criteria such as governance and management support given to members, and support received from milk unions have significant weightage- 0.3002, 0.2854, and 0.2715, respectively. We also deployed the suggested technique to conduct a comparative analysis of 98 DCSs identified from six Indian provinces constituted under NDP I (National Dairy Plan, Phase-I). Finally, the results of the sensitivity analysis have been presented to validate our proposed method.},

    abstract = {Given the current scenario of marketplace instability and uncertainty, the way companies conduct and manage their intellectual capital is crucial. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of intellectual capital as a key driver of organisational performance due to its importance as an asset in the value creation process, yet few have analysed the relationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction. Considering the relevance of knowledge management and intellectual capital in the service sector, namely in the banking system (Curado 2008; Starbuck 2002), this study aims to assess the structure of intellectual capital in a Brazilian Credit Union, and how it relates to internal communication and job satisfaction. To accomplish this objective, a structural model, based on Longo and Mura (2011), was developed and tested on a sample of 109 employees from a particular branch of the union. Results confirm the three-dimensionality of the Intellectual Capital construct and that job satisfaction, as well as internal communication, are constructs separate from intellectual capital and should not be confused. In fact, internal communication may be considered as an antecedent of intellectual capital, whereas job satisfaction is a consequence. Furthermore, results suggest that intellectual capital plays a mediation role in the relationship between internal communication and job satisfaction. Nevertheless, the framework presented in this paper is not without limitations. Firstly, the sample size and the fact that it is a case study requires caution regarding extrapolation of conclusions. A second limitation has to do with the measurement of Relational Capital, as items employed have shown to be problematic in terms of convergent validity. Nevertheless, this study holds great potential for the strategic management of human resources in banking, in particular credit unions, which is a prime concern for bank administrations, bank branch collaborators, and society at large. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model the interrelationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction in a credit union, an organisation with particular structural and strategic features resulting from its external customers being members and owners.},

    abstract = {It is a truism that Cameroon's agricultural sector in general and the cocoa sector in particular has been hit by climatic vagaries with telling repercussions. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao Linn.) production remains one of the main cash crops in Cameroon with over 90% of households in the cocoa producing areas depending on it for their income. Cameroon ranks fifth in the world in cocoa production which has a significant contribution to her economy. This important sector is exposed to climate-related shocks requiring mitigation and adaptation strategies. From an economic perspective, climate-insurance has been suggested as one of the solutions to this problem, as an option to reduce farmers' vulnerability. However, there is little or no information on farmers' preparedness and willingness to pay for climate -related insurance. This article therefore seeks to ascertain the level of preparedness of farmers to sue for climate insurance in cocoa producing areas in Cameroon. We randomly selected 10 cocoa farmer cooperatives drawn across the main cocoa producing divisions of the South West Region - a major cocoa producing region in Cameroon. We combine a structured questionnaire survey with focus group discussions to assess cocoa farmers' awareness, knowledge, perception, level of preparedness and challenges to adopting climate insurance. Furthermore, we interview insurance authorities within the region on existing insurance policies. This information is complemented through field observations and review of relevant literature. We employ descriptive and correlation analysis to assess cocoa farmers' perceptions and level of preparedness for climate insurance. We observe that there is a direct statistically significant relationship between farm sizes, level of diversification and awareness, and farmers' preparedness (P <= 0.05). Income levels showed a significant but indirect relationship with level of preparedness. Poverty, uncertainty, and weak institutions operating with policies that do not consider farmers' realities were key challenges to climate-insurance preparedness. Based on the results we recommend that (i) insurance bodies should undertake feasibility study on the possibilities of instituting friendlier policy for farmers, (ii) farmers should sensitized on the relevance of insurance policies to support cocoa farming in the face of climate vagaries, (iii) farmer groups should strengthen cooperative spirit to ease access to pro-poor insurance policies; and (iv) government should work in partnership with insurance bodies to support farmers through more climate-friendly insurance policies which can be accessed by farmers irrespective of their levels of diversification, income and farm sizes.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors influencing the agri-food cooperatives' trade credit operations by measuring their accounts receivable and comparing the results with agri-food investor-owned firms (IOFs). Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply a partial adjustment model (PAM) estimated using a dynamic panel model with a two-step general method of moments (GMM) estimator to a sample of 11,930 Spanish agri-food cooperatives and IOFs for the period 2011-2018. Findings - The study concludes that cooperatives and IOFs have an accounts receivable target, which they attempt to achieve rapidly. Cooperatives tend to behave as IOFs do, but they present lower adjustment coefficients. This difference seems to be explained by the unique characteristics of cooperatives which set different economic and social goals, not just profit maximization as IOFs. The findings show differences between the financial and commercial purposes of the cooperatives and IOFs as a result of their internal management policies. Larger cooperatives with access to external financial sources, positive cash flows and operational necessities will grant trade credit. Originality/value - This study gives interesting implications for cooperative managers and policymakers to help them to understand the strategies behind trade credit policies. Previous empirical studies on the agri-food sector are scarce and focus on IOFs without considering the role of trade credit in European cooperatives.},

This structure enables the manufacturers to reach multiple segments of consumers with different online and offline shopping preferences, but it may create channel conflicts due to the manufacturers' competitive position in the end market. Cooperative advertising programs can be implemented in response to the emerging competitive dynamics between the manufacturers and the retailers. We investigate the impact of the consumers' sales channel preference (i.e., consumer loyalty) and the product compatibility with online shopping (i.e., product web compatibility or web fit) on the cooperative advertising and pricing decisions of a manufacturer and a retailer in a dual-channel supply chain. We use game-theoretical models and characterize the firms' equilibrium behaviors under different power structures in the channel. Our results indicate that the level of the retailer's advertising investment and the manufacturer's reimbursement in the cooperative advertising program depend critically on consumer loyalty, product web compatibility, and the power distribution among the channel members. For example, when the channel power is symmetrically distributed or held asymmetrically by the retailer, the retailer's local advertising level increases as the product web compatibility decreases or the proportion of store-loyal consumers increases; whereas this trend is reversed when the manufacturer is the channel leader. We examine how the introduction of the direct channel affects the profits, and we generate additional managerial insights from numerical experiments.},

To explain the participation in this form of arrangements, the bulk of the literature has focused on firm-level characteristics. In this paper, we assess the role that the territorial dimension, in terms of social capital and geographical remoteness, plays in the explaining Italian firms' participation to Network Contracts (NC). NC have been institutionalized in Italy in 2009 to provide a legal framework for the formation of a wide range of hybrids, encompassing both vertical and horizontal coordination. Data on the population of NCs are aggregated at the municipality level and analyzed through a zero-hurdle model, that properly addresses skewed data with many zeros and admits different underlying processes to explain the zero values. Results show that the territorial dimension plays a major role in explaining the participation to NCs. Proxied through a synthetic indicator, the social capital is strongly significant and negatively related to the number of NC members at the municipality level. However, such a relation proves to be more complicated when different dimensions of social capital are taken into account and when trying to disentangle its effect on horizontal and vertical NC. With respect to geography, remoteness seems to hinder the formation of NCs, as the more peripheral a given municipality, the lower the number of participants. NCs seems to be a legal framework that is able to overcome the constraint to coordination set by the lack of social capital, but it does not show to overcome the problem related to remoteness.},

This study aims to explore the effect of multilingualism on employee ability to adjust to workplace changes based on the concept that multilinguals have been found to switch between tasks more efficiently as compared to monolinguals. Design/methodology/approach Applying a sequential explanatory mixed methods research approach, quantitative performance evaluation data on 207 credit union employees is analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling to predict employee performance, and thematic analysis of qualitative data representing the adjustment narratives of six monolingual and six multilingual employees within the sample is conducted, corresponding to the period during which employees were adjusting to broad workplace changes after the onset of the global pandemic. Findings The results suggest greater predicted improvement in the performance of multilingual employees. Reliance on the task-switching ability associated with multilingualism is found to be the primary self-evaluative factor for successful change adjustment among multilingual employees. Practical implications In light of work performance benefits identified in this study, organizations may consider multilingualism as a characteristic preceding better adjustment to organizational change, and not simply as a skill applicable to tasks requiring language proficiency, suggesting practical implications for human resource and organizational management. Originality/value This is the first sequential explanatory study focusing on the task-switching ability of multilinguals as an antecedent to change adjustment evidenced by improved work performance within an organizational context.},

We argue that, in their enthusiasm for facilitating IS innovation, the leadership of the movement neglected more deep-seated organisational issues that were, to that point, largely unarticulated. In an attempt to get to the heart of these issues, we synthesise a distinctive theoretical perspective that draws mainly on institutional theory. This helps untangle the complex institutional heritage of the credit union movement, which resulted in the emergence of an interesting hybridity of institutional logics and latent contradictions. These contradictions provoked the emergence of a particular kind of institutional entrepreneurship, which was deeply implicated in reshaping institutionalised ways of thinking and doing. We emphasise the political nature of the change process and argue that the institutional arrangements for governing the ISIS project, which also underpinned the governance of the broader movement, were not well suited to manage the risk associated with such an enterprise. We conclude by suggesting that the case described might be an example of the workings of a broader kind of change dynamics around ICT. Specifically, the scale and scope of the change project acted as a trigger that brought tensions underlying existing competing institutional logics to a head, thus provoking institutional reform.},

Because of incomplete contracts and relationship-specific investments, client organisations may face switching costs, which in some cases may be large enough to render vendor switching an unattractive option. Based on an extensive review of the literature, we develop hypotheses about relationship-, firm-, and market-specific determinants of switching costs. We then develop an econometric model to identify those determinants and their relative importance and estimate the magnitude of switching costs. In the empirical study, we observe accounting data of 1318 US credit unions (CUs) and follow their IT outsourcing choices over 11 years. We find that the largest portion of switching costs is due to relationship- and firm-specific factors, while market-specific variables are much less important. Our estimates suggest that average switching costs account for one-third of the average annual expenditure for professional services. We further highlight that the average hides substantial heterogeneity. Switching costs of CUs that decide to switch vendors are about 50% lower than those of CUs that stay. Looking more closely at stayers, our most conservative estimate of the lock-in effect, i.e., the difference in switching costs of deliberate and non-deliberate stayers, is equivalent to about 70% of the average annual expenditure for professional services.},

For the most part, many users of forest commons extract forest products, typically non-timber products, for subsistence use or safety net purposes. To overcome this problem, in recent years, collective vertical integration (VI) of forest product marketing cooperative structures have been promoted and, in some cases, adopted by users of forest commons. Although this type of program has been observed to raise smallholder incomes, there is little evidence available on saving/investment responses to such income gains. This paper investigates precautionary saving and investment responses to collective forest product marketing programs among users of forest commons in Ethiopian villages. To identify the causal effects of the program, I applied propensity score matching, difference-in-difference (DID) and change-in-change (CIC) estimators to household survey data collected from randomly selected households in the Gimbo district (south-western Ethiopia). I find strong evidence that participation in the program reduces savings in the form of livestock holdings and that effect is limited to non-poor households. When interpreted in terms of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), the results imply that participants felt the current income gains to be non-transient, which led to reduced precautionary savings and to a gain in consumption/welfare. Moreover, I found that the program has spurred investment in child education and participation in off-farm self-employment. These results point to the importance of the safety net/insurance channel of the program. Overall, the findings underscore the program's potential to raise the standard of living via ancillary mechanisms beyond directly raising income outcome. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The ruling party (the Republican Peoples' Party) mobilized the cooperative societies to avert the subversive effects of the Great Depression. Besides their economic significance, cooperative societies were formulated as alternative communication channels between the ruler and the ruled. It is argued that under the single party regime the RPP generated a regimented public sphere over these organizations to forward its messages to the masses. The periodicals published by the Turkish Cooperatives Society, the national federation of the cooperatives, provide invaluable insights into the catalyzer role of the bureaucratic intelligentsia in the construction and deconstruction of this public sphere. It is suggested that the interactions between the ruling authority and the bureaucratic intelligentsia generate a certain pattern of political culture displaying the dialectical forces immanent to any public sphere.},

Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on case study evidence from an Australian credit union that had implemented significant changes to its service strategy, and identifies employee responses to these changes. Findings - The case study identifies the way in which tradition and place can be discursive resources with which employees resist changes to work practices and roles which threaten to disrupt workplace and gender identities. Originality/value - To date, the literature has focused on tactics of resistance that draw on temporal and spatial narratives from inside the organization. This paper extends the understanding by showing how individuals also draw on narratives from outside the organization to resist workplace change.},

We find that social inclusion has been a regular practice at the DCS level, promoting a diversified social relationship among rural women. The findings highlight the process of change that has enhanced women's agency to decide and act upon them at both the household and community level. The study captures the very process of change that empowers the weaker sections of rural Bihar.

The data were collected from randomly selected 200 farmers from four blocks of Ludhiana and Patiala districts where paddy is a major kharif crop which requires adequate doses of urea for its growth. The results of the study revealed that the consumption/sale of urea in Punjab during the year 2007-08 was 2646.44 th. MT which rose to 3086.05 th. MT during the period 2007-08 to 2015-16 at an annual growth rate of 1.64 percent. The urea prices increased significantly at the highest growth of 5.21 percent per annum during the decade 1990-91 to 1999-2000 while during the period 1980-81 to 2015-16 the growth in urea prices was 3.33 percent per annum. The analysis of the primary data revealed that the majority of the respondent farmers purchased NCU and Normal urea (NU) from co-operative societies followed by private fertilizer dealers while the cost per bag of NCU, including transportation cost, worked out to be '289.69 while it was '276.58 per bag in case of NU. There was marginal increase in the productivity of paddy crop during the year 2015-16 as compared to the year 2014-15. The net returns per acre were estimated to be '31401 during the year 2015-16 and '29530 in 2014-15. As far as awareness about NCU was concerned, almost all the selected farmers were aware about the NCU and major source of awareness was co-operative societies. There was a significant increase in the application of NCU after 2015-16 in crops such as; paddy, wheat, basmati, sugarcane, potato, maize, sunflower, and vegetables. Due to the application of NCU, only 5.29 percent farmers reported about the increase in paddy yield while the cost of pest and disease control declined by 21 percent. There was increase in productivity of paddy crop where neem coated urea (NCU) was applied on the sample farms. Also, the NCU usage on the sample farms increased while cost of pest and disease control measures declined. The partial budgeting technique brought out that there were added returns of '718 per acre by application of NCU on the sample farms. It was also revealed by all the respondents that there was no change in the texture of the soil, soil moisture retention capacity, water infiltration rate, soil softness and decline in the compaction of the soil due to application of NCU but there was higher retention of nitrate in the soil and thereby its slow release to the crop. Also, the NCU usage on the sample farms increased while cost of pest and disease control measures declined. High price of NCU, inadequate/shortage of supply during peak season and poor quality of NCU in some of the co-operative societies were the major problems reported by the respondents. Major suggestions were; assured/timely and adequate supply of NCU to co-operative societies and organizing training camps for spreading awareness. Major policy issue suggested was to lay emphasis on ensuring good quality, adequate quantity and timely supply of NCU along with bringing its price at par with NU.},

This paper describes this situation as a mixed oligopoly in which consumer cooperatives maximize the utility of consumer-members and, in return, refund them with a share of the profits corresponding to the ratio of their individual spending to the cooperative's total sales. We show that when consumers possess quasi-linear preferences over a bundle of symmetrically differentiated goods, and companies operate using a linear technology, the presence of consumer cooperatives positively affects total industry output, as well as welfare. The effect of cooperatives on welfare proves to be even more significant when goods are either complements or highly differentiated, and when competition is a la Cournot rather than a la Bertrand.},

In order to scrutinise this assumption, this article proposes a set of concepts to study the dynamics of transformative social innovation and underlying processes of multi-actor (dis)empowerment. First, the concept of transformative social innovation is unpacked by proposing four foundational concepts to help distinguish between different pertinent 'shades' of change and innovation: 1) social innovation, (2) system innovation, (3) game-changers, and (4) narratives of change. These concepts, invoking insights from transitions studies and social innovations literature, are used to construct a conceptual account of how trans formative social innovation emerges as a co-evolutionary interaction between diverse shades of change and innovation. Second, the paper critically discusses the dialectic nature of multi-actor (dis)empowerment that underlies such processes of change and innovation. The paper then demonstrates how the conceptualisations are applied to three empirical case-studies of transformative social innovation: Impact Hub, Time Banks and Credit Unions. In the conclusion we synthesise how the concepts and the empirical examples help to understand contemporary shifts in societal power relations and the changing role of the welfare state.},

Co-operatives found it necessary to highlight their competitive prices and the quality of their goods. They were vulnerable to changes in the rural economy that led to a decline in the local population. Their survival also depended on the quality of their management, with poor investment decisions and recruitment practices undermining profitability. Generous credit policies also undermined the co-operatives financially. By comparing the three co-operatives and their communities, this paper aims to develop a more sophisticated approach to explaining the survival and demise of Rochdale consumer co-operatives in rural Australia.},

    abstract = {Irish beef farms have experienced poor viability longitudinally, with industry and policy actors citing 'crisis' levels in 2013. A crucial differentiator between the beef sector and the dairy sector, which has higher farm incomes, is well-developed infrastructure of farmer-owned dairy processing and marketing co-operatives. To address the lack of representative farmer organisations and power imbalances in the beef supply chain, in 2016 the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM) legislated for the establishment of beef Producer Organisations (POs), facilitating beef producers to collectively strengthen their market positioning. While PO legislation is a significant development in potentially enabling supply chain integration of farmers, how the legislation is operationalised by Irish beef industry stakeholders will ultimately shape the nature and breadth of engagement with the PO model and, consequently, the impact of the legislation. In a context where there is little or no prior experience of such organisations in the beef sector, this paper presents an analysis of current stakeholder views in relation to the establishment of POs. Research involved a desk based review of the submissions made during the consultation period for the beef PO legislation and interviews with key informants in the Irish beef industry. We analysed Irish stakeholders' views through the lens of lessons learned from the existing literature on how POs operate internationally. Results indicate some stakeholders' perceptions of the need for a nationally coordinated approach in the establishment of an Association of POs, which concurs with the literature. However, stakeholders have not emphasised the benefits of Interbranch Organisations (IBOs), which involve vertical collaboration with other chain actors such as processors and retailers, an approach that has proven successful internationally. Nor have Irish stakeholders identified the potential of differentiating or premiumising beef products, which, according to international evidence, is necessary for improving profitability and farm-level incomes. Stakeholders identified the main threats to the future success of POs in Ireland as members' lack of commitment and processors' lack of willingness to engage with POs.},

The results indicated that regional banks with more branches can increase their loans and bills discounted as well as their small and mid-sized enterprises loans and bills discounted. Thus, establishing more branches is effective in increasing the total sum of loans and bills discounted by each bank because regional banks with many branches can make contact with more customers. On the other hand, return on assets and return on equity of regional banks with more branches were found to be lower. Therefore, regarding the cost performance of regional banks, establishing too many branches and maintaining branch networks that are too large can have negative effects on regional banks.},

Design/methodology/approach The study employed a quasi-experimental design. Six SACCOS were purposively selected in four districts of Mwanza and Tabora regions in Tanzania. A sample of 500 respondents was randomly selected of whom 200 were SACCOS' members and 300 were non-members. A questionnaire and a key informant interview guide were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to analyse the quantitative data whereas qualitative data was subjected to thematic analysis. Findings The results indicate that SACCOS' services had significantly impacted on the household livelihood outcomes in terms of maize yields, household assets, savings, food expenditures and non-food expenditures. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted in two regions of Tanzania using six SACCOS. Similar studies can be conducted in a larger area of Tanzania by capturing more than six SACCOS. In addition, the study focused on the rural areas of Tanzania. The future studies can be carried out in urban areas or both urban and rural areas of Tanzania. Practical implications Local leaders, SACCOS' leaders and other stakeholders in the study area should thus mobilise non-members in their areas to join SACCOS. In addition, the Tanzania government should facilitate the formation of new SACCOS and strengthen those already operating in rural areas. Social implications SACCOS provide opportunities for individuals and households in rural areas to converge socially and economically to achieve better results (positive impact on livelihood outcomes), which otherwise could be non-achievable through single household or individual efforts. Originality/value Unlike previous studies, this study provides empirical evidence on the impact of SACCOS' services on livelihood outcomes of SACCOS members in rural areas of Tanzania where abject poverty is widespread and where the majority of SACCOS are found.},

    abstract = {Objective: Considering the turbulent economic environment as well as the peculiarities of the operations conducted by cooperative entities, this study sought to analyze the connections between strategic risks and uncertainties and the use of the Management Control System (MCS) by credit cooperatives in Brazil's South region. Method: This is a quantitative study, conducted as a survey with a sample of 57 credit cooperatives. The data was analyzed through Structural equation modeling, with partial least square estimation on SmartPLS 3.0 software. The strategic risk and strategic uncertainty constructs were analyzed in relation to their connection with Simons' Levers of Control (1995), which contemplates the beliefs and boundary controls and interactive and diagnostic control systems. Furthermore, the connections between the four Levers of Control are also analyzed. Originality/Relevance: The study covers the antecedents (strategic risks and uncertainties) of MCS use, contemplating different compositions of type and class in credit cooperatives, taking previous studies into consideration, as well as covering a singular and pertinent region in the context of Brazilian credit cooperatives. Results: Strategic risk is not associated with the use of the Management Control System. Strategic uncertainty was proven to be the element that receives the most importance from managers in the process of using the four Levers of Control. Regarding the beliefs system construct, its importance is positively linked to the interactive control system, as also occurs with the connection between the interactive control system and the diagnostic control system. Theoretical/Methodological contributions: The study demonstrates the pertinence of the Levers of Control for credit cooperatives, inserted in the context of strategic risks and uncertainties. Social/management contributions: The findings bring about relevant contributions by proving that the balanced use of the four Levers of Control is relevant for promoting the strategic renovation of credit cooperatives, especially regarding strategic uncertainty.},

Further, supervisors are more likely to recognize voice from employees who have higher achieved status-cued by their centrality in informal social structures. The authors also find that even when certain groups of lower status employees speak up more, they cannot compensate for the negative effect of their demographic membership on voice recognition by their boss. The authors underscore how recognition of employee voice by supervisors matters for employees. It carries (mediates) the effects of voice expression and status onto performance evaluations 1 year later, which means that demographic differences in the assignment of credit for voice can serve as an implicit pathway for discrimination.},

Taking the latest global trends into account, only organizations that produce high-quality, organic food can become the basis of agricultural cooperation capable of giving an efficient impetus to the territory development-not single organizations, but rather a system of agricultural consumer cooperatives (ACCs) that provide storage, processing and marketing of finished products in cooperation with the small-scale agricultural sector (private subsidiary farming (PSF) and family (farm) enterprises F(F)E), as well as agricultural organizations that are the main producers of raw materials with modern qualified management, the support of local authorities, regional and federal authorities. In reality, most of the rural population, small and medium-sized organizations are not ready for new investments because they have no own funds but only old loans. Beginning farmers also lack sufficient funds for their further development, even with the help of a selective state support represented as Novice Farmers and Family Farms grants, as well as subsidies for technical equipment. This requires new mechanisms and methods of the state support for the creation and operation of ACCs, as well as intensive involvement of non-agricultural businesses with competences in commerce, logistics, marketing and other skills not typical for agricultural producers in the agricultural cooperation system on the basis of grant support for investment projects.},

We build on existing work on hybridities in organizations which predominately focus on issues of language and knowledge by focusing on the organizational interactions themselves, especially the embedded interactions between humans and objects. Seeing these interactions as 'friction' means not trying to solve or dissolve them - but to acknowledge them as lived realities of an Indigenous organization.},

We suggest that policy-makers should re-frame the governance apparatus associated with mutualism and social ownership in terms of the concept of meta-regulation.

Employing the rationale of isomorphic incentive compatibility from system science, we analyze the necessity and influencing conduit of rural credit cooperative's shareholding reform theoretically. Analysis shows that only the financial services from rural commercial banks can promote the modernized production, and thus the synergism between them drives rural economic development. Then we make empirical analysis on the effect with a Chinese provincial sample. Comparing to provinces with lower reform progress, the provinces with greater reform progress are influenced more prominently by this reform. Applying coupling coordination degree model, the coordination between agricultural production and rural banking development shows obvious increase, especially after the formal implementation of shareholding reform on rural credit cooperative. Empirical results indicate that this synergism plays positive roles in promoting agricultural growth and reducing the urban-rural income gap. In addition, these effects are more pronounced after the formal implementation of shareholding reform.},

    abstract = {This paper explores tensions over scale and viability in irrigated agricultural development in Tanzania. A revival of ambition to transform African agriculture has reawakened debate over what type of agriculture can best deliver increased production and poverty reduction for rural populations. This paper examines these debates through the lens of an ethnographic study of an irrigated rice farm in Tanzania. With a chequered history of state and donor intervention management, Dakawa, Rice Farm in Mvomero District is now collectively farmed by a cooperative society of 'small farmers'. It is widely hailed as a success, both of irrigation production, and of 'small farmers' in delivering this. However, such narratives of smallness and success obscure a more complex reality in which smallness of scale may be more of a discursive tool than a reflection of empirical reality. Although notions of 'viability' and 'success' in such development interventions are themselves also contested and depend on perspective, there is evidence that there are fundamental problems of both short- and long-term viability.},

We also find that both cost inefficiency and the number of private enterprises affect the profitability and welfare consequences. We then investigate the rationing policy on the production of social enterprise and show that output rationing is superior to market share rationing not only for the social concerns of the underprivileged but also for total social welfare, even though it is less attractive than subsidy policy.

The extant literature has focused on structural factors and performance of the board. Outside directors, board members' education and female representation have been considered essential board characteristics. Consequently the election of board members has become an object of interest. A successful election process is assumed to generate a competent board. Many of the studies discuss the topic in the context of public limited companies. However, cooperative seldom emerge in these studies. This has both academic and practical consequences: the understanding on the cooperative governance does not accumulate and practitioners do not have in-depth knowledge available in order to develop their cooperatives. What make cooperatives different from other firms are a broad member base, customer, worker, and entrepreneur relationships to the cooperative and differences in the governing bodies. These features have special implications on the governances of cooperatives. The purpose of this paper is to gather existing academic knowledge on cooperative governance and to produce an overall review on the governance mechanisms in cooperatives with an emphasis on the election of board members. The goal is to figure out what we know about the governance and the election of board members in cooperatives. The review sheds new light on the academic discussion on cooperative boards, their composition and processes as well as their election. The novelty of the work lies in the diverse approach of cooperative governance. The study shows knowledge gaps in the extant literature of cooperatives and makes suggestions on future research. It builds a framework for future studies in the field of the governance of producer, consumer and worker cooperatives as well as credit unions. The method of the study is the integrative literature review.},

Analysis of the responses to the questionnaires showed that human capital based co-operatives governance comprise members' participation, independence of the board, depth of expertise and competencies of directors and other characteristics of the board. This study also identified branding as the most important success factor ahead of competitiveness and proximity.

The relationship between competition and risk also varies across bank types based on different initial levels of risk. Increasing competition appears to reduce the risk of (City) banks with higher initial levels of risk, but increase the risk of their (Regional, Tier 2 Regional, Shinkin and Credit Cooperative) counterparts with lower initial levels of risk.},

Our unique historical evidence on learning-related communication over multiple decades shows that the subjective and collective attitude toward prodevelopment communication may be ideologically conditioned. Prodevelopment communication is the norm in capitalist organizations, but competing ideologies may emphasize other goals higher than organizational development. Consequently, increasing challenges to capitalism as the ideological basis of economic organization can have deep impacts on how organizations learn and produce innovations in the future.

Since 2003, sonic mutually-supported financial societies gradually gain the recognition from the government supervision agencies and gain a lawful status. However such cooperative agencies proceed very slowly with a lot of hindrance factors. Comparatively, some cooperative societies simultaneously organized by the peasants and some peasants' financial mutual supporting agencies become active and become an important way to solve temporary financial needs of the farmers in the process of production, which also provide a possible way for the integration of various sources in the countryside. Such modes have achieved success in Japan and Korea, although in China they remain in the state of research.

Supported by Dewey's pragmatic constructivist paradigm and the PEST conceptual framework, a qualitative inquiry research through in-depth telephone interviews with 20 leaders from banks and credit unions in Texas was conducted. The findings revealed some common ways to provide online financial literacy education, including website information posting, online financial calculators, external links, social media communication, and partnering with appropriate third parties. The financial leaders perceived that applying online technology would be an enlightening future direction especially for the millennial generation but face-to-face education would remain important. The opportunities included social responsibility fulfillment, corporate image strengthening, marketing, and favorable regulatory consideration. The challenges involved the human and financial resources constraints, IT support, lack of effective evaluation, and how to motivate online learning. Some leaders suggested the use of games, financial incentives, and innovative apps. The policy implications included increase in government support, partnership with schools, embracing financial literacy in the state test, and collaboration among financial leaders, regulators, educators, and policy makers to foster financial literacy for the benefits of the society.},

Research into the Reindeer Herding Industry has been conducted in order to gain information on their management and to develop a socially-oriented strategy conducive to overcoming the accumulated problems. Institutional transformation is a mechanism through which the accumulated problems of herding can be addressed, and the industry can be shifted from a pattern of regression towards evolutionary development. Institutional transformation is based in the ethnic and economic features of the reindeer herding family and ancestral households and directed towards correcting the defects of the legal system and the system of herding management. The conflict between the needs of family and ancestral farms, the resources of the traditional economy, and the established institutions pose challenges - ideological (political), social, economic, and ecological - to the system of management. The organizational model for institutional transformation in the reindeer herding industry is founded on the confirmation of the private farm as the primary legal form of organization for reindeer herding, supplemented by competence centers, reindeer herding parks, the legal, organizational entity of the agricultural consumer cooperative, and novel measures of state support for family and traditional households. These findings indicate a connection between the problems of reindeer herding, indigenous peoples, and national settlements. Accordingly, projects aimed at solving the problems in the spheres of the traditional way of life must function jointly on the social, ecological, and economic levels.

The industry has a very rich cultural background that has influenced in no small way, its organization, products and survival. Socio-economic assessment of wood artifact products in Oyo state, Nigeria was carried out with a view to determining the value of the enterprise. Structured questionnaires were administered on the wood carvers. Purposive sampling method was adopted in selecting the respondents. Forty questionnaires were given to wood carvers of which thirty two (80 per cent) were duly filled and returned. The study showed that a large number of people are engaged in the industry which has a high potential for employment and fuller utilization of timber resources. The product quality is greatly affected by the carvers' skills as well as the tree species used. Results showed that the industry is profitable with an average Gross Margin of N333,274.50 and an average Net Return of N328,304.50 annually per enterprise. The wood carving industry is beset with some problems, prominent among these are lack of finance for expansion, narrow market, cultural belief and poor business organization. It is recommended that the carvers must of necessity team up as a cooperative society for a proper development of the industry which in turn would foster government assistance to provide incentives for wood carving industry in Nigeria.},

    abstract = {Innovativeness is a decisive factor for a firm's performance since it reflects its capability to adapt to changing conditions. When behavioural innovativeness is concerned, the socially oriented activities of co-operatives suggest that specific values and behaviours within such organisations may influence their innovativeness. Hence, this research aims at better understanding how this co-operative difference impact on the co-operative innovativeness. In order to answer this objective, the research focused on the particular case of the Federation des caisses populaires acadiennes (FCPA), a Canadian second-level financial service co-operative, and 13 of its credit unions. A questionnaire was administered online to a population of 888 employees, with a response rate of 65.1% (578 respondents). The component analysis of 9 statements on behaviours and values oriented towards innovation and improvement resulted in two factors accounting for a satisfactory 62.5% of the variance. The two factors represented components of the behavioural innovativeness in terms of the supervisor's transformational leadership, and team collaboration. Hypotheses were made suggesting the positive relationship between the two factors and behavioural innovativeness as expressed by the commitment of the employees towards the success of the cooperative and the improved quality of its services. Moreover, it was suggested that a cooperative difference, as perceived by the employees, would positively affect the relationship between the cultural factors and the behavioural innovativeness. Results of the structural analysis of the conceptual framework, using Lisrel 9, showed a significant and positive full mediation of the co-operative difference between the supervisor's transformational leadership and the co-operative behavioural, and a partial mediating role of the co-operative difference between team collaboration and behavioural innovativeness. These results are of interest for cooperative managers. With a focus on specific human resources practices aimed at enhancing an innovative culture at the management and the team levels, they could contribute to build a co-operative difference in the workforce and from these efforts, develop the organisational commitment towards innovation.},

The research has a qualitative-quantitative approach, of documentary and field design, with a correlational scope. A questionnaire composed of 13 questions that evaluates the variables of human talent management and personnel turnover was applied to a population of 122 workers from four COACs that agreed to participate in the study. The validity of the instrument is evaluated through Cronbach's Alpha coefficient and to analyze the correlation between the variable's human talent management and staff turnover, Spearman's method is applied. The analyzed indicators that have a greater incidence in the personnel turnover in the COACs of segment 4 in the Ambato canton are: payment of overtime, low incentives, poor performance evaluation, lack of professional development and inefficient communication; these evaluated indicators contribute to the disengagement of workers and high personnel turnover in the organizations.},

Design/methodology/approach An event study was performed using 240 days pre-event period and an event period that consisted of 25 days pre and 25 days post the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement in Kenya. The difference in differences (DiD) method was also used for cause-effect analysis for two years before and three years after the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement. The outcome variable was firm value, whereas the treatment and control groups were Kenyan listed firms and deposit-taking credit unions, respectively. Findings The event study method found cumulative abnormal returns after the date of the board diversity reforms announcement to be positive and significant. The DiD methods found a positive and significant market reaction to the March 2016 board diversity reforms announcement in Kenya. Research limitations/implications This study was limited by the secondary data that was collected and analyzed from financial statements and stock price data from the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). Financial statements have the disadvantage of being affected by the judgment and estimates of their preparers or accountants. Practical implications Emerging markets like the NSE are vulnerable to market manipulation by insiders. Efficient stock markets are known to attract more investors who are interested in a trustworthy stock price determination mechanism. The Capital Market Authority should thus continue implementing corporate governance reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of the NSE and the trustworthiness of stock prices therein. The continued reforms thus imply better value for money for the NSE investors. Originality/value This study makes an important contribution to literature by combining an event study and DiD analysis to assess market reaction to board diversity reform announcements in emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa which is a concept that has not been researched before. Past studies have used event studies to investigate the efficiency status of stock markets in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the current study used an additional method of DiD and hence contributed to literature.},

The machine labour saving in basmati and non-basmati was 28.47 and 37.79 percent respectively with DSR. Results brought out that saving in the number of irrigations for basmati DSR and non-basmati DSR were 50 and 43 percent respectively. The per ha total variable cost in basmati DSR was lower ((sic)22032) when compared with TM ((sic)27682) and in non-basmati per ha total variable cost in non-basmati DSR ((sic)22246) was also lower when compared with TM ((sic)29376).

In the case of DSR, there was no significant difference in yield between DSR and TM of basmati as well as non-basmati. The study suggested that for faster adoption of DSR, the subsidy should be made hassle-free, the role of extension services need to be strengthened.

This is a particularly challenging problem being faced by the small and marginal farmers in any emerging economy. Farmer collectives (FCs) which are cooperative societies of farmers, launched under Federal Government initiatives in many countries, offer the prospect of enabling cost-effective procurement of inputs with assured quality. We seek, in this work, sound and explainable mechanisms for the above important use-case. In particular, we propose the use of incentive compatible auction mechanisms that could be used by an FC to procure quality inputs in bulk. The idea is the following. An FC collects from the farmers their individual requirements for inputs and aggregates them into different buckets. For each bucket, the FC identifies suppliers who meet the quality criteria and engages them in a competitive procurement auction. We explore in this paper, two particular types of procurement auctions: volume discount auctions and combinatorial auctions in the framework of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms. These are explainable mechanisms that induce truthful bids from the suppliers as well as maximize the social welfare. We show their efficacy through carefully designed thought experiments. Our field studies of FCs give us the confidence that such mechanisms, if deployed systematically, can become a game changer, benefiting a massive community of smallholder farmers.},

These practices are conceptualised as part of processes of agencing and concerning: (s)electing and equipping work to arrange consumer agencies, while engaging and enacting refer to ways of concerning others that put agencies into motion.

The credit cooperative movement that grew up in Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century had to wrestle with both. These cooperatives thrived, in part, because they adopted strategies first to obtain and then to harness the information they needed about the communities in which they were located, giving them an advantage over other lenders. Particularly effective was the tactic of using local people as managers, which helped to cement their ties with the community. Yet because few, if any, locals had banking experience and most were not even familiar with basic accounting methods, the managers created internal management problems, intensifying outside suspicion of the cooperatives as banking enterprises. The methods the cooperatives developed to overcome these problems drew on a combination of local initiative and regional assistance that was typical of the movement as a whole. The movement's ability to train its own talent suggests that it had a broader impact than has been captured by statistics on its membership or financial assets.},

In this model, a cooperative society with high social capital is an outcome of effective, collective government. The combined model predicts that social capital has a semi-independent causal effect, in addition to revenue, on the inclusiveness of governments. Our results indicate that the combined model of collective governance fits the data on U.S. states better than the revenue model alone. The combined model of governance predicts that revenue and social capital moderate the population size-political complexity relationship, and data from the U.S. states are consistent with these predictions.},

    abstract = {To stay ahead of their competitors, firms need to create and develop proactive strategies that emphasize factors that differentiate them from others in their sector. In this sense and given the current scenario of marketplace instability and uncertainty, the way firms develop and manage their intellectual capital (IC) is crucial. Firms can be distinguished from their rivals in terms of their ability to identify, invest in and manage their IC - in other words the knowledge over which they exercise control or influence - an intangible asset that is not as easily quantifiable or replicable as other assets. In today's globalized and highly competitive world, the only way to compete with producers benefiting from low production costs is to invest in people, and this requires organizations to believe in the creative ability, emotional intelligence and adaptability of their staff and collaborators. Human resources with appropriate skills, motivation and commitment are the key to increased competitiveness because only they have the capacity to create products and services with greater value for the consumer and thereby generate better performance by the organization. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of IC as a key driver of organizational performance due to its centrality as an asset in the value creation process (Chen, Shih and Yang, 2009; Kang and Snell, 2009; Campisini and Costa, 2008). However, few studies have demonstrated the relationship that may be developed between various aspects of IC and the satisfaction felt by the staff involved (Longo and Mura, 2011). Employee satisfaction (in general) and promotion opportunities expressing organizational recognition of staff contributions (in particular) provide a stimulus to greater committed to the organization's interests and thereby enhance productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. Clearly, since human resources (HR) constitute the only asset that, strictly speaking, the organization does not own, and that the time and money it spends on training can easily be wasted if staff turnover is high, it is crucial for 21st century organizations of all types to attract, develop and above all retain qualified, committed and satisfied staff. Our focus on Credit Cooperatives (CC) is explained by their emergence as a significant alternative to large financial corporations - especially private banks. CCs are able to offer specific and attractive benefits to their members and can play a key role in stimulating socioeconomic development at the territorial level (Araujo and Silva, 2011; Segui-Mas and Izquierdo, 2010). The aims of the research reported on here were (1) to identify which aspects of IC most influence employee satisfaction in the financial institutions analyzed and (2) to specify the type of influence these dimensions have on staff satisfaction. Data were collected using a questionnaire based on Bontis (1998) applied to all employees of a CC in north-eastern Brazil. After processing the data using SPSS 21.0, it was found that (1) Human Capital is not an unidimensional concept and was further subdivided into training and participation; and (2) only structural and relational dimensions of IC affected respondents' satisfaction positively. By making known to organizational leaders and managers that there exists a link - albeit indirect - between IC and organizational performance may encourage them to invest more in an intangible asset that has the intrinsic ability to create sustainable flows of value for both client and organization.},

In this article, we propose a partially-centralized organization of consumers (or agents), namely, a consumer cooperative that purchases electricity from the market. In the cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group. The technical challenge is that consumers make their own demand decisions, based on their private demand constraints and preferences, which they do not share with the coordinator or other agents. We propose a novel multiagent coordination algorithm, to shape the energy demand of the cooperative. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information, the coordinator determines virtual price signals that it sends to the consumers to induce them to shift their demands when required. We prove that this algorithm converges to the central optimal solution and minimizes the electric energy cost of the cooperative. Additionally, we present results on the time complexity of the iterative algorithm and its implications for agents' incentive compatibility. Furthermore, we perform simulations based on real world consumption data to (a) characterize the convergence properties of our algorithm and (b) understand the effect of differing demand characteristics of participants as well as of different price functions on the cost reduction. The results show that the convergence time scales linearly with the agent population size and length of the optimization horizon. Finally, we observe that as participants' flexibility of shifting their demands increases, cost reduction increases and that the cost reduction is not sensitive to variation in consumption patterns of the consumers.},

The study found that PMIS quality, information quality, and service quality are significantly important for the PMIS, and its impact on the net benefits derived from PMIS was studied. The results also reveal that the net benefits of the system impact the financial behavior and financial attitudes of SHGs and cooperative members, consequently significantly impacting financial wellness.

This has raised concerns as to whether banks that have traditionally supplied credit to production agriculture will continue to do so after consolidation. Another major concern is whether consolidation is motivated by greater efficiency, or whether consolidation is resulting in greater market power without achieving cost savings. Study of the production technology of financial institutions can determine whether and to what degree economies of size exist and how agricultural lending will fit into the overall business plans of consolidated banks. Generally, empirical studies have used either duality theory with the estimation of cost functions or nonparametric estimation methods to assess efficiency in the financial services industry. The purpose of the present study is to estimate economies of scope and scale in agricultural banking. This will be accomplished through estimation of an indirect multi-product cost function. The uniqueness of this study, when compared to previous studies of efficiency of the financial services industry, i's the disaggregation of the outputs so that agricultural lending can be evaluated. In addition, a normalized quadratic cost function is estimated with curvature properties imposed. Clark reviewed thirteen studies that measured economies of scope and scale for commercial banks, credit unions, and savings and loan associations. He found that they offered four broad conclusions: (a) overall economies of scale exist at low levels of input, (b) no consistent evidence of economies of scope exists, (c) some evidence of cost complementarities exists, and (d) the results seem to be robust among financial institutions. Humphery also reviewed studies that examine the issue of economies of scale for banks and found that little cost savings exist for increases in size alone. He concluded that significant benefits accrue from loan diversification. Humphery also reported that the differences in cost structure within the same firm size category are larger than measured cost economies. Berger, Hunter, and Timme reviewed the efficiency of financial institutions. They discovered that many of the previous studies showed the average cost curve to be relatively flat. They also suggested that differences in technologies may occur between small and large banks or that some factor that varies with bank size may be excluded from previous studies. McAllister and McManus found that the translog cost function specification gives a poor approximation when applied to all bank sizes, suggesting that nonparametric estimation procedures should be examined. In addition, they included risk as a cost factor in the estimation. Berger, Hunter, and Timme suggested that, although frontier estimation methods are theoretically correct, studies that have compared results of frontier methods to those of more traditional estimation methods have found only small differences for scale measures.},

Based on archival material, the article explores Wollemborg's biography and develops a content analysis of his discourses. The findings show that, by making a pervasive use of face-to-face narrative accountability, Wollemborg obtained trust and engagement of external potential stakeholders, thus expanding the rural credit cooperatives (Raiffeisen-style). This research facilitates understanding of the relevance for the initiator of a new organisational model to act as an 'accountable self'.},

Various brands of embodied, extended, enacted, and distributed cognition, some more conservative and some more liberal, have paraded in philosophy and cognitive science. I call the genus including all such species situated cognition and go on to depict selected cases in nonhuman comparative cognition. Distributed cognition is often used as another term for situated cognition. But behavioral biologists have used the term in another sense, to mean the reduction of cognitive capacities arising from team work in cooperative societies. Hymenopteran insects have been studied as cases. The octopus displays embodied cognition, with some of the computational work offloaded to the periphery. Web-building spiders showcase extended cognition, in which objects external to the animal-the web, in the case of spiders-play a crucial causal role in cognition. A criterion of mutual manipulability, in which causal influence flows both ways between organism and extended object, serves to delimit the scope of extended cognition. Play in dogs features intelligence on-the-run, arising out of action, a key characteristic of enactive cognition. I discuss other cases in which action entwines with central representational cognition to achieve goal-directed behavior. Considering situated cognition in diverse animals leads to myriad research questions that can enrich the field.},

    abstract = {Food processing industries are assuming greater importance and processed food is now not a matter of choice but it is a necessity. As a result there is greater awareness of safety concerns, emerging risks and challenges in the context of food products. Consumers want guarantees for food characteristics, thus, calling for transparency and effective response in case of any food related health problem. This paper presents a framework for transparency, traceability and information flow for management of dairy supply chain networks. This paper follows a case study approach and presents findings from three types of dairy supply chains as prevalent in India. The paper analyses complexity of dairy products as well as processes in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors and their effects on the underlying dairy supply chain networks (DSCN). Governance mechanisms dovetailing various stages of the DSCN are presented in terms of their gaps and adequacy. Key components of the presented frameworks are harmonization of national standards with codex standards, hygiene control, strengthening quality control systems, enhancing information flow across stages, animal health care, disease free zones and formation of cooperatives of small dairy processors (CSDP) in line with the present dairy cooperative society (DCS). CSDP aims at collective action and public-private partnerships by the unorganized sector units to face the competition from large organized processors of dairy products in terms of quality, transparency, traceability and information flow. Transparency of a DSCN is the extent to which all its stakeholders have a shared understanding of and access to the product related information without loss, noise, delay and distortion. Given the perishable nature of dairy products, an effective traceability system is an important tool not only to manage food quality and safety risks, but also to promote the development of effective dairy supply chain management. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on transparency and traceability issues of dairy supply chain networks. Findings would be useful for policy makers in framing standards and effective regulations. Analysis of complexity would be useful for dairy industry managers.},

This analysis is then applied in a particular social economy initiative, Cretamo, a consumers' cooperative operating a grocery store in Thessaloniki, Greece. The results indicate that Cretamo has developed in the central node of an eco-system of same-minded social enterprises in the agro-food sector, offering an alternative niche to the mainstream economic model. This has changed relations both within the initiative and in its networks, while, at the same time, allows for increased innovativeness capacities. Cretamo has not yet the power to challenge the existing mainstream regime. Yet, it offers a valid alternative niche, which, combined with the socio-economic crisis still experienced in Greece and expected to intensify in the future, creates strong potential for societal transformation.},

Adopting a broad class of such technologies and practices is often critical for meeting the multifaceted goals of efficiency, profitability, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience. This study aims to address the knowledge gaps that still exist concerning what determines the adoption of improved technologies and production practices, the factors affecting their diffusion, the impact of interventions on productivity and crops grown, and the variability of impact within a particular country context. In this paper we address these questions using data collected as part of the USAID-led Knowledge-Based Integrated Sustainable Agriculture in Nepal (KISAN) project. We adopted a multistage sampling technique and surveyed 988 beneficiary households and 997 non-beneficiary households in KISAN intervention districts and non-intervention districts. Our findings suggest that, in Nepal, adoption of improved technologies and practices is significantly increased by improved access to markets, private sector involvement in selling improved seeds and disseminating information, membership in progressive farmers groups and cooperative societies, participation in agricultural training and farm visits, provision of subsidies for seeds, and access to credit. We also found the probability of the adoption of improved practices to be affected by farmers' sources of information; for instance, the adoption of improved practices was increased when farmers obtained information from informal sources, cooperatives/farmers organizations, and public and private extension programs. The effects of KISAN projects vary significantly across the different crops grown, based on the evaluation models that address self-selection of both project participation and crop choices. These implications may also apply to other parts of the world facing similar challenges as Nepal, where limited market access, insufficient knowledge and resource capacity of farmers constrain their adoption of improved technologies and practices in agriculture.},

The authors offer practical recommendations on the design and formation of effective forms of management of economic entities in the cooperative sector, as well as the development of a new institutional model of innovative development of the system of consumer cooperation adequate to the challenges of modern society, capable of restoring the competitive positions of its subjects in the regional market. Modeling of sustainable innovative development of the regional system of consumer cooperation assumes the use of the following system-forming components: resources (material, human resources, knowledge, technologies, etc. necessary for the production of an innovative product), space (territorially differentiated innovation activity of economic systems), institutions (set of rules and Mechanisms that stimulate the innovative activity of economic systems). It is the personnel resource as the most difficultly formalized will be the subject of our consideration. The choice of the vector of its strategic transformation should be directed in favor of new methods of managing this resource, in order to achieve the set goal with nonincreasing material costs. The first stage in the implementation of the proposed system may be the formation of a basis for designing the vector of economic development, namely, the creation of map-bases of the basic regional resources. And, as an example, the creation of a single regional base of the labor reserve as a key (system-forming) factor. It is the definition of the structure of this resource that will give the main impulse for the rational formation of this or that production cycle.

The results of the panel regression estimates showed that, among the deposits mobilization variables, the deposit to loan ratio, deposit to total asset ratio, the volume of deposits, and demand deposit ratio had a significant direct impact on financial sustainability. The fixed effect regression result for interest rate spread showed that an inverse relationship existed between the interest rate spread and financial sustainability. Furthermore, according to our robust fixed effect regression results, among the control variables, the age of the institution and inflation rate affects financial sustainability. Contrary to our expectations, the number of members and the percentage of woman members were not significant. This may be attributed to the fact that some members were inactive for a long period. We suggest that RUSACCOs should focus on deposit mobilization specifically on demand deposits and keep the interest rate spread narrower to ensure their sustainability.},

This article argues that we are observing a regime shift in the transaction costs of organizing that disfavors traditional corporations. Accompanying this shift is the emergence of low-cost, small-scale production technologies that will allow locally based universal fabrication facilities. In combination, these changes are compatible with new forms of non-corporate enterprise. While corporations are basic units of production in many theories about the economy, they should be regarded as only one hypothesis about how production is and can be organized. Traditional alternatives to the corporation include producer and consumer cooperatives (e.g., Land o' Lakes, REI) and mutuals (e.g., State Farm, Vanguard). More recent possibilities include commons-based peer production (such as Linux and Wikipedia) and platforms that connect buyers and sellers (such as Uber and Airbnb). The raw materials are available for more democratic and locally oriented enterprise. Management scholarship has an opportunity to document and encourage this movement.},

    abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of conditions and factors of labor productivity growth. As an example, agro-industrial enterprises of Kemerovo region were taken. Research strategy is directed to the analysis of qualitative and quantitative information on the condition of an object, the use of such empiric methods as statistic data analyses, unstructured interviews with executives, and employee questionnaires. In 2017, the Federal Program was adopted, in order to increase labor productivity and contribute to employment. To implement the Program, representatives of enterprises of all fields and all business entities must participate actively. The results of an expert interview demonstrate that executives are very concerned with the problem of low labor productivity in the whole country, in Kemerovo region, in their own enterprises, and can see the ways of its solution, but they are not included properly in corresponding managing aspects. On the average, in the agro-industrial sector the labor productivity increase goes on faster than in other industrial fields of our country, but in terms of value it is low. When workers of a Kuzbass enterprise containing of two agricultural consumer cooperatives for the production of dairy products were questioned, it was revealed that there were the following problems: bad condition of equipment and mechanisms, uncomfortable work and rest schedule, unsatisfactory working tension and rhythm, ineffective system of work stimulation, insufficient social support for workers, and others. So, the factors of labor productivity growth lay in the economic and logistical areas as well as organizational and social ones. (c) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK},

Moreover, some of the banks may focus their activity on farmers who traditionally use local financial institutions. The model of the cooperative bank's functioning including the concentration of activity on specific services, groups of clients or local community's needs is most of all dependent on the management's decision. Due to relationship problems of agencies in cooperatives what determines most the functioning of credit cooperatives are the management's objectives. The aim of this paper is to provide a diagnosis of cooperative banks' business models and to examine the features of the models and its conditions as exemplified by a selected group of 75 cooperative banks in Poland. A substantial number of Polish cooperative banks do not offset their raised deposits and granted loans. Those banks as net lenders for other participants of the financial market do not follow a cooperative principle: local money for local needs.},

    abstract = {This research attempts to explore the process of change and to examine in more depth the nature of the changes in management control which accompany the adoption of the new information technologies within small and medium enterprises. In particular, recognizing that management control change is a continuous organizational process (rather than an outcome), the trajectory of which is shaped by an incessant inter-play of several influences, this research intends to explore the way in which the implementation of a new integrated information system contributes to this process. To address this issue, the current research combines theoretical and empirical insights. After having reviewed the literature on the main topics and produced a theoretical understanding to illuminate the nature of the aforementioned changes, the research relies upon an illustrative case study concerning a medium-size cooperative society based in Italy. Recognising the complexity of organizational life, the field study does not aspire to isolate and define how and by how much ICT has been a driver of the management control change, but rather to explore the whole process of change in order to appreciate the diversity of interrelated influences which have shaped its trajectory and how these influences interacted with each-other. Among this inter-play of influences, the study aims then to investigate the particular role played by the two-way relationship between ICT and management control. The implementation of the new integrated information system has opened up several opportunities for the business management and in particular for the management control. However, so far, only part of these opportunities have been exploited. Furthermore, while it could be acknowledged that the new system facilitated the changes in management control both in its material and immaterial dimensions, it could not be concluded that they were the result of the implementation of the new system. Many other factors have interacted within the process of management control change. For example, of paramount importance has been the controller's determination to enact the change. The case study analyzes these factors and the way in which they have jointly facilitated and/or hindered the management control change.},

Here we argue that explicit and implicit forms of profit sharing should be viewed as two sides of the same coin, and can both be given convincing theoretical foundations. Relevant models include the importance of fairness and equitable pay and repeated games with mutual monitoring by profit or rent-sharing workers. Most empirical work has neglected the selection problem, or the existence of favourable but unobserved preconditions for profit sharing, and so probably exaggerates productivity gains from profit sharing in isolation and benefits from tax incentives. Cross-sectional regressions have also failed to uncover specific channels of influence of profit sharing.},

Subsequently, the practices of the form transformed, especially after the Russian-Ottoman War, concomitant with further changes in Ottoman society's institutional order. Although OMSs initially enjoyed legitimacy granted by the Ottoman State, the shift towards dominating state logic in the Hamidian era led to the erosion of practices animated by market and community logics. The form was discontinued as the increasingly autocratic state levied taxes and preyed upon the accumulated surplus, which disabled agglomerative capacity of sandiks and diminished the solidarity among cooperative members.},

Using unique organisational and market level data from Ethiopia, we then test empirically whether the observed (weak) performance of producers' cooperatives in Africa is explained by their organisational boundary - the type and range of goods or services they provide to members. The empirical results confirm that the competitiveness of producers' cooperatives is significantly correlated with the type and number of services - i.e. cooperatives that provide club goods and a limited range of services are found to be more competitive. The results also suggest that a considerable number of cooperatives in Ethiopia engage in markets where they do not have competitive advantage. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of properly defining a viable boundary - proper selection of services (or markets) and limiting the range of services - for improving the competitiveness of membership-based producer cooperatives in Africa.},

Retail consolidation, technological change in production and marketing, and growing consumer demand for produce, have altered the traditional market relationships between producers, wholesalers, and retailers. Against these changing supply and demand relations, fresh produce suppliers are being asked to provide additional services and incentives in exchange for volume purchases and other commitments by buyers. The demand for such fees and services coincides with new modes of retailer operation. Necessary processes such as washing, sorting, packing and distributing products, provided either by third party logistics provider or by producers owning relevant facilities at their premises. Product quality followed by food safety and traceability consist drivers for competition that, could secure repeat purchasing. Moreover, the usage of packaging materials along with their reverse disposal plays an important role saving both environmental and economic resources, as waste reduction has become a prime concern in industrialized countries. In view of depleted landfill and incineration capacities, efforts are made to re-integrate used products into industrial production processes for further use.},

Extremism is modelled as a production factor whose effect on expected revenue is initially positive and then turns negative, and whose level is optimally chosen by a revolutionary organization. The organization is bound by a free-access constraint and hence uses the degree of extremism as a means of indirectly controlling its level of membership with the aim of maximizing expected per capita income of its members, like a producer co-operative. The gist of the argument is that radicalization may be an optimal reaction to perceived failure (a widespread perception in the Muslim world) when political activists are, at the margin, relatively strongly averse to effort but not so averse to extremism. This configuration is at odds with secular, Western-style revolutionary politics but seems to capture well the essence of Islamic revolutionary politics, embedded as it is in a doctrinal framework.},

It is well known that in the absence of regulatory mitigation the population density has a positive effect on broadband diffusion. Hence, we measure the effect of the population density on the determinants of broadband diffusion throughout the postal codes of Finland via Geographically Weighted Regression. We suggest that the main determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density follow a spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong strength or non-concentric convex/concave. Based on 10 patterns, we argue that the Finnish spectrum policy encouraged Mobile Network Operators to satisfy ambitious Universal Service Obligations without the need for a Universal Service Fund. Spectrum auctions facilitated infrastructure-based competition via equitable spectrum allocation and coverage obligation delivery via low-fee licenses. However, state subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract investment from nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies encouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber consumer cooperatives. To explain this emergence, we show that when population density decreases, the level of mobile service quality decreases and community commitment increases. Hence, we recommend regulators implementing market-driven strategies for 5G to stimulate local investment. For example, by allocating the 3.5 GHz and higher bands partly through local light licensing.},

This article attempts to consider some of the theoretical and practical implications of this growing role by treating them as 'value-driven' organizations, and asking how this differentiates them, in terms of efficiency and accountability, from public or private agencies. It notes the lack of developed theoretical models capable of dealing with this question, and examines the relevance of existing theories (neo-classical economics, public administration and especially varieties of organization theory including the New Institutional Economics) in dealing with agencies which claim to be dominated by motivations based on democracy and altruism rather than self-interest. The author looks at problems associated with the measurement of efficiency and enforcement of accountability in organizational life and at the need for effective incentives and sanctions which provide a stable basis for maintaining commitment. He then considers the issues involved in the enforcement of accountability to ensure the efficient use of resources in producer co-operatives on the one hand and service delivery NGOs on the other. In the former, the focus is on the strengths and weaknesses of market competition and the costs of collective management; in the latter on the varied relationships between 'principals and agents' involved in the production and management of services.},

The leading methods of the study are an abstract-logical method, the 5W + 1H formula set, as well as information theories, probabilities, and statistical methods. The paper proposes a multi-criteria model for selecting an information resource to meet the information needs of the representatives of small agribusiness within the framework of a specific request, depending on the characteristics of the formula 5W + 1H. The processes of assessing particular criterial functions and compiling the objective function of the model are also considered. The use of a multicriterial selection model is demonstrated on the example of the informational need of an agricultural agrotechnical consumer cooperative for updating the material and technical resources. The significance of the research topic is determined by the fact that in most cases for small agribusiness, information is the only resource (capital) at the initial stage of operation. More than that, the search process is hampered by the lack of the necessary level of qualification and information culture. The multi-criteria model of selecting an information resource can find its application both in scientific research of information needs and in modeling and development of information technologies for agribusiness.},

Although finance inclusion can widen social and economic opportunities, the successful usage of microcredit depends on the costs (rates of interests) and on the methodology applied to grant credit. Hence, through a bibliographic review, the paper presents a comparative analysis of three remarkable experiences on microfinance. Firstly, the Brazilian Community Development Banks (CDB), inspired by the Grameen Bank and devoted to reaching the poor of the poor. Secondly, the programs applied by some Public Development Banks (PDB) in Brazil to foster entrepreneurship through microcredit. Third, the Italian Credit Cooperatives (BCC - Banche di Credito Cooperativo), essential in the provision of credit for small enterprises and households. Despite their peculiarities, there are some similarities in their governance and methodologies applied to grant credit. The local dimension, the relationship lending to capture soft information for risk analysis, and the purpose of serving the community providing financial services instead of generating and distributing profits are standard features. These experiences could inspire a proposal for microfinance expansion, based on the ground principles of mutuality, solidarity, cooperation, and localism.},

Lactobacillus plantarum, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Bacillus cereus and Lysinibacillus fusiformis were the common bacterial species isolated from the fermentations. The PH 9 hybrid showed highest diversity of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria. Twenty-seven volatile compounds were identified during the cocoa fermentation of all hybrids. Chocolate from PH 9 hybrid had most desirable flavors and obtained the most ideal score in acceptance test. Chocolate from PH 15 hybrid was considered the most bitter, acidic and astringent. Chocolates produced by different cocoa hybrids showed differences in sensory attributes and acceptance. Therefore, special management is required for the different hybrid fermentations to obtain high-quality chocolate. Practical ApplicationsAs a solution to the recovery of the cocoa crop in Brazil, many hybrids resistant to the disease called witches' broom were developed, but the impact of these crosses on cocoa quality, consequently in chocolate is not known. The producers' cooperatives and farmers of cocoa have no technical or scientific information about the behavior of cocoa hybrids during spontaneous fermentation process, which, oftentimes give rise to an uncontrolled fermentation of cocoa hybrids mixture. The results of this paper could be used among the producers' cooperatives and cocoa farmers for guidance about the influence of genetic improvement on the quality of cocoa fermented beans and chocolates, particularly among the three hybrids evaluated in this study.},

Ruth First was an important commentator on the Alexandra Bus Boycott of 1957, in which the author participated. Some 20 years later, the author was recruited by First to the CEA, where he worked with Ruth First and others on labour migration, forced labour and on the newly established communal villages and agricultural producer cooperatives. First, although heavily involved in administration, nevertheless managed to find time for fieldwork of this kind. The author contributed to ongoing fieldwork at the CEA, and his results were fed into the teaching through his contribution of interviews, work songs and other material for the Mozambican Miner, later published as Black Gold. Examples are given of the directness of Ruth's criticisms, and of her sympathy for ordinary Mozambicans. The article concludes with recollections of responses made to the author on Ruth's death.},

First, it shows that while the boundaries between the nature and property regime of goods may be relatively clear for natural common goods, they appear much more interlinked for human-made goods, where commons are embedded in intergenerational reciprocity. Second, it demonstrates that financial cooperatives can be understood as human-made commons and proposes a new way of thinking about public policies to design adequate legislation to protect these commons from isomorphism, privatization and destruction.},

But new evidence shows that PR strengthens the left and redistribution, and we argue the standard view is wrong historically, analytically, and empirically. We offer a radically different explanation. Integrating two opposed interpretations of PR-minimum winning coalitions versus consensus-we propose that the right adopted PR when their support for consensual regulatory frameworks, especially those of labor markets and skill formation where co-specific investments were important, outweighed their opposition to the redistributive consequences; this occurred in countries with previously densely organized local economies. In countries with adversarial industrial relations, and weak coordination of business and unions, keeping majoritarian institutions helped contain the left. This explains the close association between current varieties of capitalism and electoral institutions, and why they persist over time.},

However, in the course of the operation of microfinance companies, due to the lack of careful management and risk control, the problem of risk management has become increasingly prominent. The purpose of this paper is to study the microfinance risk based on polygenic artificial neural network, and it provides theory and practice application for risk management of microcredit enterprises. Taking the risk management of China's microfinance companies as the research object, on the basis of previous studies, this paper analyzes the risks of bank microfinance companies. Secondly, the basic theory of neural network model and its transformation function are introduced, and the learning method of neural network. At the same time, the learning algorithm of neural network and its improved algorithm are mainly introduced. It lays a theoretical foundation for the follow-up empirical research. Then, through the empirical study of data-based risk assessment of microcredit of farmers, the sample data are divided into training samples and test samples for comparison. Then, we use MATLAB software to establish a neural network model for farmers' microcredit risk assessment. Finally, in order to make the neural network model of farmers' credit risk assessment better popularize and apply, and effectively reduce the credit risk of farmers' microcredit. The corresponding policy suggestions are put forward, which proves the validity and applicability of the neural network in the field of farmers' microcredit risk assessment. It provides a good basis for rural credit cooperatives to identify the credit risk of farmers.},

    abstract = {In the conditions of the financial system destabilization in Ukraine, caused by such negative phenomena as military actions in the East, the economic downturn, political and financial crises, population disappointment in the institution of power and loss of the people's confidence in power structures and so on, market mechanisms are not able to ensure the restoration of the national financial market and to encourage its professional participants to use mechanisms of protection their own assets and the assets of their clients from external and internal threats actively. State interference in the functioning of financial institutions is necessary, especially for those of their types, whose bankruptcy may have fatal consequences for the welfare of the population and cause the liquidation of economic entities of the domestic economy. Among them are: banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and other institutions of credit co-operation, investment companies, in particular, joint investment institutions (unit and corporate investment funds), non-state pension funds, leasing, factoring, and other financial companies, pawns, etc. Therefore, it is expedient to consider the possibility of the influence of state regulators in financial services markets on the state of their participants' economic security. However, the study of the realities of the financial market of Ukraine development has made it possible to assert that for a number of financial institutions, the concept of economic security is something abstract, and the understanding by their top management the importance of economic security management, taking into account the negative market trends, is completely absent. So, the purpose of this study is to diagnose the level of financial institutions preparedness for the implementation of economic security management into their common system of management. The high level of financial market participants' readiness for safe-oriented management will allow regulators to rapidly implement in their practice a list of recommendations that will minimize the threat of bankruptcy and liquidation of domestic financial institutions. Methodology. In the process of preparing a scientific article, a great number of literary sources was considered. Some of them were developed using the method of theoretical generalization and the monographic method. The theoretical results presented in the research materials were obtained on the basis of the study of works of such scientists as Amadae S. M., Baily M. N., Elliott D. J., Ismail Z., Johnson K. N., Mirtchev A., Nelson J. A., Raczkowski K., Schneider F., Sidek Z. M., Ula M., Whalen C. J., Wierzbicka E., Yong J. To confirm the reliability of the scientific results presented in the article, the authors used the Delphi method and expert evaluation. The list of indicators for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of a mechanism for managing economic security in the following five areas is formed. These areas are: the availability and condition of the economic security system, the state of information and analytical support for the adoption of management decisions in the field of economic security, the state of intellectual and personnel management provision of economic security, reserves of financial support of economic security, the level of external influence on the state of economic security (state regulation and supervision). In May 2018, representatives of the top management of various types of financial institutions, scientists, researchers, and analysts who were interested in the issues of economic security management of the financial sector were interviewed. Their answers were analysed and the level of readiness for managing the economic security of the most common types of financial institutions in the financial market of Ukraine was determined. Using the graphical method, the obtained scientific results are presented in a convenient and understandable form for the perception of all interested persons. Results of the survey. The necessity of carrying out diagnostics of the readiness to manage economic security at the level of state regulatory bodies and at the level of top management of financial institutions in the near future is substantiated. A large-scale analytical work was carried out on determining the parameters of financial institutions readiness for the continuous and professional economic security management, which should be carried out with the use of a systematic approach. Based on expert opinions, a preliminary assessment of the various types of financial intermediaries' readiness to integrate security-oriented management into the financial institutions' common management system was made. Practical implications. The proposed methodological approach for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness to manage their own economic security should be used by the state regulators of the financial market, in particular, by the National Bank of Ukraine and the National Commission, which performs state regulation in the field of financial services markets, to monitor the activities of professional financial market participants in order to conduct advisory and consultative work with their owners and managers, as well as for the development of strategic guidelines for the provision of the state financial security. It is desirable to implement into the practical activities of financial intermediaries our proposals for increasing the readiness for implementation of the economic security management mechanism in the existing systems of management. Value/originality. For the first time, a scoring methodology was prepared for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of economic security management as an independent direction of management, and not as one of the tasks of other types of their management activity. At the theoretical level, the substantive interpretation of the notion of the readiness of financial institutions to manage their own economic security is proposed. The reasons for the impossibility of the modern financial institutions to manage their own economic security effectively are identified, and a few suggestions to minimize their number in the near future were made.},

Contrary to received wisdom, labor-managed firms are not smaller than conventional firms; they grow as fast or faster in all industries. The two groups of firms organize production differently. Labor-managed firms are as productive as conventional firms, or more productive, in all industries, and use their inputs efficiently; but in several industries conventional firms would produce more with their current input levels if they organized production like labor-managed firms. On average overall, firms would produce more using the labor-managed firms' industry-specific technologies. Labor-managed firms do not produce at inefficiently low scales.},

There is no change if costs and demand are given, unless the trade partner is a low-cost country. However, the scope for non-profit objectives is limited by the country's relative size if wages are market-clearing and if workers and firms are stationary, because of reduced competitiveness caused by higher real wage rates. The total surplus is then not affected by the actions of the SOE. International trade does not otherwise reduce the scope for its non-profit objectives if workers and firms are mobile, but productivity differences might require restrictions in order to avoid a complete relocation of the workforce in either country.},

Using a long panel of Uruguayan firms, the author presents new evidence on firm survival by comparing WMFs with conventional firms. After excluding microenterprises and controlling for differences in the effective tax burden faced by the two types of firms, the hazard of dissolution is 29% lower for WMFs than for conventional firms. This result is robust to alternative estimation strategies based on semiparametric and parametric frailty duration models that take into account unobserved firm-level heterogeneity and impose a range of distributional assumptions about the shape of the baseline hazard. The higher survival rates of worker-managed firms seem to be associated with their greater employment stability. This evidence suggests that the marginal presence of WMFs in actual market economies cannot be explained by the fact that these firms are less likely to survive than conventional firms.},

Recently, the application and implementation of FCLC in the Chinese micro finance bank has mostly relied on subjective judgment, and it is difficult to control and lower loan risk. In view of this, this paper is dedicated to researching and solving this problem by constructing the FCLC model based on improved particle-swarm optimization (PSO) and the multiclass, least-square, support-vector machine (LS-SVM). First, LS-SVM is the extension of SVM, which is proposed to achieve multiclass classification. Then, improved PSO is employed to determine the parameters of multiclass LS-SVM for improving classification accuracy. Finally, some experiments are carried out based on rural credit cooperative data to demonstrate the performance of our proposed model. The results show that the proposed model makes a distinct improvement in the accuracy rate compared with one-vs.-one (1-v-1) LS-SVM, one-vs.-rest (1-v-r) LS-SVM, 1-v-1 SVM, and 1-v-r SVM. In addition, it is an effective tool in solving the problem of loan-risk rating.},

This paper discusses the selected issues of corporate governance in the cooperative banking sector in Poland. It outlines the contemporary challenges of corporate governance principles in the Polish cooperative banking sector related to external and internal supervision of banking activity. In addition, this paper aims to answer the question whether and to what extent the Polish cooperative banks have adopted the recommendation of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority with regard to corporate governance in the banking sector and the extent to which internal rules for the organization of these banks affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the market. As a result, the following hypothesis was put forward: implementation of the corporate governance principles in the Polish cooperative banks has not contributed significantly to the improvement of their efficiency and has not enhanced the institutional supervision and internal controls in the cooperative banks. According to the authors, despite the existence of corporate governance principles in all Polish cooperative banks, there is still problem with the effectiveness of these institutions. Cooperative banks in Poland have experienced the phase of lethargy since 2013 and reported weaker and weaker financial results. Having in mind the fact that in 2015, that is after 14 years of stability in the sector, one of the Polish largest cooperative banks, SK-Bank, got bankruptcy, nobody predicted this event. It concludes that when it comes to the corporate governance principles the management bodies, regulators as well as supervisors require more effectively cooperation. The results in this paper confirmed that the model of credit cooperative movement adopted in Poland requires implementation of a couple of basic changes that are directly related to the utilization of the principles of a good corporate governance. The current corporate governance rules in Polish cooperative banks lead to having standardised governance without any substantial improvements and promoting better governance.},

    abstract = {Indonesia has long history of microfinance (MFI) services in both rural and urban areas. Access to financial services has allowed many low-income families to make significant progress in their own efforts to escape poverty. The government supports the growth of MFI services through many instruments, such as regulations, subsidy, and directed credit policies. Currently, there are two broad classification of microfince institutions in Indonesia, i.e., bank-MFIs such as BM's Unit Desas and rural banks (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat-BPR), and non-bank MFIs such as credit cooperatives (Koperasi), Islamic microfinance (such as Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, BMT), rotary-club saving (arisan), etc. As a business unit, the MFIs must follow the principle of efficiency to survive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of one type of the MFI in Indonesia, namely Syariahrural banks (BPR-S). The common approach to measure the level of efficiency of a business unit used by management is financial approach, such as ratio of operating expenses to operating income. However, economists normally use production function approach or its derivation to measure the efficiency. We are comparing the two approaches to evaluate the efficiency levels of the BPR-S. The results show that the efficiency levels of the BPR-S are generally operating in a good efficiency. Efficiently ratios of BPR-S during the sample period of time have been mostly above 90%. The efficiency based on the financial ratios confirms the finding from the production function approach. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that influence farmers' preference for the use of Islamic banks in Turkey and to investigate their knowledge level and perception about Islamic finance. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data used in this study is obtained by drawing a sample of 1902 farmers who are members of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives Union (ACCU) from 37 provinces of Turkey. Pearson's Chi-square test is used to analyze the association between the demographic features of farmers, conventional bank usage and Islamic bank usage. Binary logistic regression model is used to estimate the factors influencing the preference for Islamic banks. Explanatory variables include knowledge on Islamic banking and finance, perception of compliance to religion, saving ability and cost concern along with the control variables of Islamic bank branch number in the region and age of respondent. Robustness check is conducted via alternative models using ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression. Findings - Less than 10% of the participant farmers use Islamic banks and 59% declare they know nothing about Islamic banking. Age, education level, income level, nonagricultural income level, saving ability, duration of working in agriculture, land size and region are significantly related to farmers' preference of using Islamic banks. Knowledge level, perception of religious compliance, saving ability and cost concern are statistically significant factors that influence the probability of using Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications - This study does not include the analysis of the relationship between being religious and using Islamic banks because questions related to the assessment of religious practice were excluded due to the ACCU's sensitivity to investigate personal beliefs. Therefore, future studies can expand the scope of this research by investigating religiousness. The sample is chosen from the ACCU members who are already benefiting from a formal source of credit; therefore, the results should not be attributed to all farmers. Practical implications - Islamic banks and microfinance institutions' further engagement in the agricultural sector and ACCU's implementation of Islamic finance instruments. Social implications - Islamic banks' further diversification in the agricultural sector and ACCU's implementation of Islamic finance instruments. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the farmers' perception and preference of Islamic banking in Turkey. The sample size of 1902 is much larger and geographically diversified compared to studies in agricultural finance. This study will be valuable for the agricultural finance empirical studies in Turkey as well as an important addition to the emerging literature on Islamic finance.},

The objectives of the study included; to describe the socioeconomic characteristics of broiler business owners, to analyse the effects of selected socio-economic characteristics of micro broiler business owners on the survival of micro broiler businesses in Calabar metropolis, and to analyze the marketing mix and managerial practices of business owners in Calabar metropolis. It made use of primary data obtained from a random sample of 112 micro broiler operators. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and Ordinary Least Square Multiple regression approach. The result of analysis revealed that micro broiler business ownership is almost evenly distributed among males 47.32 percent and females 52.68 percent; and that more than half (56.25 percent) of the respondents are within the age brackets of 36-45 years. The study also revealed that respondents had one form of formal education or the other with tertiary education accounting for 75.89 percent. On the survival/competitive advantage of micro broiler firms in the study area, the result of Ordinary Least Square analysis showed that output of broiler, flock size, business experience, mortality and extension contact significantly contributed to a firm survival in broiler business. The study revealed that firms applied some management practices and marketing mix activities in operating their businesses. The managerial practices adopted and their mean weights included; planning (M = 3.80), organizing (M = 3.47), directing (M = 3.80), coordinating (M = 3.63) and controlling (M = 3.91). Also, the analysis showed that the marketing mix practices adopted and their mean values were; product (M = 3.23), price (M = 3.04), place (M = 3.77) and promotion (M = 2.26). The study shows that micro broiler operators showed positive attitude to all the management function and marketing mix practices. The study recommended that micro broiler operators should organize themselves into cooperative societies to enable them enjoy the benefits of economies of size and credit facilities from lending agencies. It was also recommended that relevant extension services should be made available to broiler operators to improve their skills and knowledge in broiler business operations. Policy action of government should be directed towards capacity utilization of operators. Also, subsidies should be provided for cost of feeds and day old chicks as well as instituting a flexible credit policy to reduce cost of production.},

This Article presents a case study of a large worker cooperative in South India that has worked well for a long time. This cooperative illustrates, among other things, that worker control and worker democracy are not necessarily inconsistent with the degree of hierarchy and delegation that may be essential to effective operation. The cooperative has been able to compete despite paying wages and benefits that are dramatically higher than those paid by its competitors, while at the same time providing far better working conditions. How it has been able to do this is something of a puzzle. Part of the explanation is good fortune at its inception in attracting effective, honest, and dedicated managers and, subsequently, in avoiding government involvement and in being able to ignore cumbersome and unsuitable legal rules. Perhaps more important is the workplace culture and the ability to harness forms of mutual monitoring not available to competitors. At the end of the day, it is unclear how much of the success of the cooperative is a function of its cooperative nature and how much is a product of its unique circumstances. Still, the story of this enterprise offers useful lessons in the organization of economic activity, particularly in the importance of nonlegal mechanisms for maximizing individual cooperative productivity.},

    abstract = {Very different commodity chains had been established over the centuries in France to produce and sell wines as diverse as champagne, fine old clarets, or ordinary table wines. The major shortages caused by the vine disease phylloxera after 1875 forced merchants to search for new sources of supply, often in foreign countries or through the production of artificial wines. When domestic production revived, however, the recovery was not accompanied by a noticeable reduction in these new supplies, with the result that prices, as well as growers' profitability, fell sharply after the turn of the twentieth century, strengthening the merchants' power in the various commodity chains. To overcome this situation, growers in three very different wine-producing areas, namely the Midi, Bordeaux, and Champagne, used their political influence to achieve government intervention in order to control fraud and establish regional appellations or producer cooperatives, which helped them win back some of their market power from merchants.},

    abstract = {This paper provides new evidence on the objectives pursued by worker-managed firms (WMFs). The basic neoclassical model assumes that WMFs maximizes net income per member instead of total profits (Ward, 1958). Even though it has been largely criticized, the Ward model has dominated the self-management literature. Alternative models suggest that WMFs are not only concerned about income per worker but also about the level of employment. However, the empirical content of these competing theoretical models has been rarely analyzed. This paper contributes to fill this gap by estimating the parameters of a generic welfare function, following the methodology proposed by Craig and Pencavel (1993). These parameters determine the relative importance that a WMF places on income per worker vis-a-vis the level of employment. Estimates are based on a long micro-panel of Uruguayan firms covering the entire population of Uruguayan worker-managed firm and conventional firms in 31 3-digit sectors over the period April 1996-December 2005. Following a strictly neoclassical framework, but simply allowing a more general specification of the WMF goals, we show that the assumption of the basic neoclassical model of the WMF is misleading. Our results support the view that WMFs are concerned with both employment and income per worker. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This article explores, theoretically, the current challenges and opportunities for cooperatives to develop successfully in the globalizing economy. To this end, we provide an analytical, critical review of the key bibliography concerning some fundamental aspects that shape the relationship between economic globalization and cooperatives, an issue that has been generally neglected by previous literature. Three key fields are addressed: 1) the viability of cooperatives, based on their strengths and possible weaknesses, under current globalization; 2) the role of these organizations in promoting the local development and stability of local communities; and 3) the tensions and potentialities that internationalization entails for cooperatives. Based on the analytical review and the organization of the literature, we propose an agenda for further research. This includes some hypotheses and strategies for testing them that would be essential to assess the role of cooperatives in economic globalization, and sheds light on key areas for future research that could provide a better understanding of the complexity surrounding the relationship between globalization and cooperatives.},

Consequently, a number of plans and programs have been proposed and implemented to bring about such development in Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro review of the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land reform of 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the population growth as evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production (1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further deteriorated. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable for agriculture, but only about 19% is cultivated. This suggests an underutilisation of land. Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and education which are essential to development have not been given due attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural technologies used by farmers have changed little in this century. Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most potent economic force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from the central government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total agricultural credit, fertiliser and improved seeds respectively go directly to socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5% of the total cultivated land and 4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises with credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting smallholders, has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in Ethiopia. Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no significant development of agriculture in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform.},

It is often hindered by a lack of understanding of multilevel institutional dynamics. This article aims at conducting a socio-historical analysis of the institutional context allowing the development of a specific cheese value-chain in the province of Trento (Italian Alps). Using Ostrom's institutionalist approach, we conducted a historical analysis of the formal and informal multilevel institutions. Our results showed that a subsistence economy prevailed between 1800 and 1950, which implied little commitment from the producers to build up collective organisations, despite government and church incentives. When the modernisation of agriculture started around 1950, it meant that the production could be intended for the market, which enabled the development of producers' cooperatives. The province became autonomous in 1948 and supported those local dynamics. Since then, we have observed an increasing level of trust among the different local actors and towards the provincial government. Since 2000, the valorisation of cheese specificity has become a central strategy to face competition at different levels. However, at the same time the production has undergone intensification. This leads to a loss of the link between product and territory. The future challenge is therefore to implement innovative institutional arrangements that allow a sustainable differentiation of cheese.},

Engagement pods are grassroots communities that agree to mutually like, comment on, share, or otherwise engage with each other's posts, no matter the content, to game Instagram's algorithm into prioritizing the participants' content and show it to a broader audience. I argue that engagement pods represent a response to the material conditions of platformized cultural production on Instagram, where proprietary curation algorithms wrest knowledge and control of the labor process from producers. Cooperative algorithm hacking of this sort, although quite distinct from traditional organizing strategies, responds to the coercive force of the threat of invisibility that necessitates constant data production. They represent a collective attempt to exert some control over their conditions of presence-to-others and, in so doing, combat precarity and protect wages in the field. In a post-industrial economy where traditional models of labor organizing have struggled to address the conditions of platformized cultural work, I argue that the unusual phenomenon of Instagram engagement pods represents an organic form of worker resistance that responds to the unique conditions of these workers.},

    abstract = {Academics, managers, and workers often debate the merits of employee ownership and employee involvement in firm decisions. The recent popularity of employee stock ownership plans and the appointment of union and pension fund representatives to several corporate boards has renewed interest in understanding whether employee ownership can make firms more productive and profitable. Few studies, however, have compared the performance of management-run, or ''conventional,'' firms with worker cooperatives. Existing studies usually compare the productivities of firms and workers in different industries. By examining conventional and worker-controlled firms in the same industry, Craig and Pencavel provide a better comparison. The authors analyze data on the inputs and outputs of Northwestern U.S. plywood product mills from 1968 to 1986. Their data contain observations on conventional, union, and worker co-op firms. From these data, the authors try to determine whether cooperatives can produce more output than conventional firms that use the same level of inputs. To determine this, the authors must control for differences in the scale and products of plywood mills. The authors begin by discussing how worker ownership is likely to affect the use and productivity of inputs. They also discuss factors that affect the formation and failure of cooperatives. The authors hypothesize that the availability, cost, and control of capital play key roles in the formation and continuation of cooperatives. The authors next compare output produced per worker, output produced per unit of capital, and output produced per unit of timber input. They find that cooperatives have greater productivity per unit of timber input but lower labor productivity. The cooperatives also operate at larger scales than conventional firms. Craig and Pencavel isolate the effects of scale and differences in factor usage by estimating multifactor production functions. These production functions control for differences in input usage, scale, factor and product prices, and business-cycle effects. Their estimates suggest that cooperatives have slightly better productivities than conventional firms. Output supply function estimates reveal that cooperatives have lower output price elasticities. This latter finding suggests that cooperatives smooth production more than conventional firms when demand unexpectedly changes. In other words, cooperatives are less likely to reduce inputs and output when plywood prices fall or to expand inputs and output when prices rise. Craig and Pencavel conclude that worker ownership does not have ''first-order'' consequences for the factor productivity of plywood product firms. Although they find that plywood cooperatives respond differently to demand and supply shocks, these responses do not seem to have much of an effect on firm productivity. The authors conclude by listing factors that affect the formation and survival of cooperatives in this and other industries.},

William Foote Whyte was one of the first researchers in the United States to analyze the functions and effects of Mondragon's governance structures, in a series of journal articles and books starting in 1977. The interest in Mondragon continues. A recent library search identified over 70 books and 60 journal articles published on different aspects of the cooperatives. This research note provides an update on trends in the cooperatives' economic conditions, employment levels, and governance structures since 1990.},

    abstract = {Purpose: The topic of gender diversity is assuming greater importance not only for regulatory reasons. In credit cooperative field, the presence of a gender diversity can qualify among the mutual aims and social sector should pursue. With reference to cooperative banks, the work aims to verify whether board gender diversity increases the creation of value for stakeholders, in terms of stakeholders global value added (shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, community and external environment). Design/methodology/approach - We propose an econometric approach based on OLS regression model; the econometric model adopted to test our research hypothesis take into account three dependent variables in order to measure the amount and the distribution of value created by each cooperative bank, like Global Value Added Index, HHI Index and GINI Index. Regarding the regressors in order to express the bank governance profile, the choice of variables is based on the results of the studies relating to bank governance-performance. Our model takes also into account other macro-economic control regressors. The model is tested on a sample of Italian cooperative banks. Originality/value - Previous studies on board gender diversity in cooperative banks are particularly limited as a result of limited information and opacity of this field. The existing studies are limited to analyses of the effects on performance of the separation between ownership and control or of the corporate and governance structures, neglecting the dynamics of gender diversity; recently, some authors have investigated the relationship between the composition of loan portfolios and the structure and membership of the boards of cooperative banks in Spain, without however considering the board gender diversity. Our work allows you to expand the knowledge on the issue of governance of cooperative banks. Our study proposes some indicators to assess the social and mutual performance of cooperative banks; it puts in evidence if board gender diversity may improve the amount and also the equity distribution of the value creation process to stakeholders' cooperative banks. Practical implications - The outcomes of the paper may indicate possible best practices with respect to bank governance in bad economic times. So the gender diversity in board cooperative bank may contribute to support better business performance and, specifically, the bank's ability to create and distribute finance customers characterized by a lower credit risk. Based on these results, some managerial implications are proposed.},

Design/methodology/approach The study uses a panel data set of 419 firm-year observations of listed companies in Kenya covering the period 2010 through 2018. Data are collected from the annual reports and analysed using a generalized estimations equation model. Findings The results reveal that there is momentum towards newer reporting frameworks in Kenya with substantial IR and SR disclosures in their annual reports. The results also show that level of SR and IR disclosures is influenced by both agency-related factors (board gender diversity, audit committee independence, block ownership and the presence of foreign ownership). Additionally, institutional-related factors (regulatory pressure and promotional efforts of regulatory and professional bodies [reporting excellence awards]) influence the disclosures. Practical implications The results highlight that initiatives such as those led by the regulatory and professional bodies in Kenya are effective in motivating companies to enhance disclosures. Thus, regulators and professional bodies might need to continue and even intensify their efforts. These results have implications for further research as they show that SR and IR disclosures are influenced by similar factors. Social implications The study has the potential to contribute to the ongoing initiatives and discussions on the adoption of IR by firms in Africa as spearheaded by the African Integrated Reporting Council. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge, the study is, perhaps, the first to examine both SR and IR disclosures at the same study allowing comparison of the extent and drivers of the two disclosures. Moreover, examining the institutional-related factors in a single country has not been done in prior literature, and so this is an innovation.},

    abstract = {Approximately 7 per cent of the African population is affiliated to the cooperative movement, and in Kenya alone, cooperatives provide some two million employment opportunities. In Africa, as elsewhere, inequalities persist between women and men in terms of access to and control over resources and opportunities. ILO provided insight into the inequality in unemployment based on gender. In employment, women are found more often than men in informal and precarious work, with particularly pronounced imbalances in some sectors (ILO, Geneva 2002). The critical importance of closing gender gaps - which are not only contrary to the realization of women's rights, but also an obstacle to poverty reduction - is widely recognized. The report on the State of Food and Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) shows, for instance, that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase farm yields by 20-30 per cent, raising total agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5-4 per cent, which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17 per cent (FAO, Rome 2011). For women, who due to gender-based norms often have lower access to and control over economic and social resources and opportunities, cooperatives present distinct advantages. According to Argawal, women participation in cooperatives has its own advantages. Apart from being able to access economies of scale as providers of services, producers or as consumers, participating in a cooperative as a member, elected leader or manager also brings with it enhanced status and voice in the community and society in general (Argawal 2001). Given that there is insufficient research data on gender issues in Cooperatives, and in particular the participation of women in Leadership roles, KUSCCO in collaboration with the Cooperative University of Kenya conducted an qualitative empirical research that focused on co-operatives under the umbrella of the Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives (KUSCCO) and explored initiatives that KUSCCO has put in place in promoting gender integration in them and recommended strategies for enhancing gender balance.},
